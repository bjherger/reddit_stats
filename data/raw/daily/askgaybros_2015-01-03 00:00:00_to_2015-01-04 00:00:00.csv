Not really experienced with kinky stuff and definitely not experienced with men (this'll be my second male encounter, he is the same guy as the first time).
Originally got head planning on it being a one time curiousity thing but it was so good I'm gonna make it regular.

Anyway, I'll be meeting him again soon and this time I've got no excuse for shyness.
Here's the low-down, I know he likes it rough and I wanna make this hot for him without being a tryhard. His last suckbuddy used to slap him hard in the face and stuff, but I'm not keen on that.

I'm looking for ways to use him that aren't gonna hurt him. He said he really wants to choke on it and for me to use him like a fleshlight so I'll try that but I don't really know what other stuff I can do to keep it exciting for him.

One thing I was thinking was to push him down and then make him try to tell me he loves my cock or something (like a fucked up version of fluffy bunny) but I don't actually know if that's physically possible and I'm worried if I ask him to do it and it can't be done or something.

Basically, this guy likes to be dominated and while that's a hot thought for me, I have no experience in being dominating. Please help gaybros :)

Though I wasn't clinically diagnosed, I am VERY insecure and constantly worry about my appearance. I also suffer from various mental disorders, such as hypochondria and mild social anxiety. I worry about cancer occasionally, and I am too afraid to speak or approach attractive guys. I am a psychotic bitch, that's me in a nutshell. 

I know BDD has been crippling because I've been avoiding A LOT of social situations. For starters, I only have two friends. One of them is gay, has a boyfriend, and is always busy. My other friend moved to college. I literally have no one to hang out with. I'm not looking for pity, but my life pretty much blows.

About a month ago, I messaged an old friend on Grindr. I haven't seen him in years, so he wanted to catch up. He said he was always interested in me, but I was 15 around that time. Anyways, we've been talking on the phone on a daily basis. I am fairly new to hooking up, so he's willing to be patient and endure the challenges that come with meeting me. I am also still a virgin, as I've only gave oral a couple of times. 

Back to the BDD. We were supposed to hang out at his house about 2-3 weeks ago, and I canceled because I was ""busy helping my mom"". Truth is, I canceled because I don't think I'm attractive to meet up with him and cuddle. I feel rejected by the gay community. I feel obligated to live up to the WeHo gay scene and to have the perfect ""gay body"". I can't meet up with this guy because I don't have none of that, though he has addressed that all of that doesn't matter to him. I don't buy nice clothes because I am too scared to wear it. All of that takes a toll on me and prevents me from participating in social activities, and sometimes the occasional hook up. 

Has someone had a similar issue? 

TL;DR I have BDD, and it prevents me from meeting a great guy.

My best friend and I are both in our 20s and identify as straight (though im definitely bi) and have recently started experimenting. We live far apart, and can only visit each other every few months, but last time we tried jerking each other off while watching straight porn.

Anyways, I have a trip planned for next week, and my friend and I have been talking over the past week about giving each other blowjobs, which was fine with me. We have more recently been skyping and masturbating to gay porn in order to ""research"" techniques, etc. We decided to 69, and we moved on from there.

Well, the other day, he texts me asking if I want to try anything else. I say im down for whatever, and he mentions that the only thing left is anal. Now, this isnt the first time he has mentioned anal as our last option, so I asked if he would be interested in that. He said yeah. Im a bit nervous to be honest. Although I really like this guy (love him actually but im trying my best not to), im not super comfortable with the idea of anal. My doctor says that I have a really small butt, and Im worried that it would possibly hurt and or tear. At the same time, my friend has had a lot of issues with his butt as well, like hemorrhoids and such. I worry that we arent experienced enough yet to do this sort if thing. The other thing that I have a more minor concern about is that my friend doesnt want to use condoms. Im a virgin, and he has sex very rarely, so Im not super concerned about STDs, but I am worried that blood/feces might become a factor given both of our medical situations.

On top of it all, he says that it's ""one night of fun"". He is convinced that this is all going to be a one time thing and that after we will never do it again (which is exactly what he said about jacking each other off and jerking off over skype). I'm just not 100% sure I want to do this with someone if they only want it once.

Has anyone dealt with this sort of thing before? Thanks for any insight y'all can offer!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all, just a quick question for my bros out there:&lt;/p&gt;

Yet another Friday evening alone (cue world's tiniest violin) has given me the balls to ask a question for once. I'm wondering if anyone has any tips for making friends as a young professional in a new city. Is it hard for everyone? 

I'm 23 and fairly newly out. I travel almost weekly for work so I'm gone nearly every Monday-Thursday, which I often use an excuse but I don't think it's insurmountable. I like to think I'm a pretty interesting, outgoing, and intelligent guy - maybe I'm too cocky.

I think part of it is that I have trouble getting up the nerves to ask someone to grab for a beer or whatever. I have more trouble doing it for a platonic type of situation than a date, honestly. 

I was talking with someone about this and she suggested that I try Toastmasters as a way to meet people, which I will probably do. I volunteer a lot in the community, albeit mostly through orgs that aren't that conducive to meeting other young people, so maybe I need to rethink how I use my time when I'm around.

Since then I have gone to see him once after thanksgiving. Most recently he came to visit me for three days in my home city. 

To put things simply, it was amazing. We talk everyday, phone calls, texting and the occasional facetime throughout the week. After a month without seeing each other face to face, finally getting to spend quality time together felt great. 

We explored the bars, restaurants and sites of interest in my city, while making up for lost time. We went downtown for some fun on New Years eve, and then went home. We welcomed in the new year with my brother and his girlfriend over card games and beer.

Despite some hesitance on my part, we did have sex with each other for the first time. I had planned to wait until I was certain we were both emotionally invested in the sex. Based on his actions and his commitment to making the best of our unique circumstances, I felt comfortable having sex. 

He still has yet to say that he loves me back, even though he has talked to me everyday for 8 months now, refers to me as one of his closest friends, suggests we eventually live together, and plan other trips together for the future. I'm in no hurry, but I'd be lying if I said it didn't bother me.

Each time we meet up in person I learn more about his character and personality that I enjoy. He makes me very happy and treats me as a partner should. 

For now we plan to see each other sometime next month for a few days and then again over my spring break the following month.

So, I met this guy from Tinder, he is 31 years old so he is kind of experienced, I'm 23 years old and a total noob with this kind of things.

We started talking a lot, not the typical talking for a hook up (you know the basics: ""what's your role?, wanna fuck?"" and such). At the beginning he was really interested in me, he asked about a lot of stuff to know if we were kind of compatible, music, food, work, living style, habits, and so on.

He was traveling to my city for the holidays, and at least what I noticed was that he was eager to know me and well... have sex. (I was eager too, nervous and eager). 
This was my third time with a man, and my first time anal, I'm a bottom so it was a really big deal (**offtopic:** the other two times were just foreplay).

As I told you, I was really nervous and the sex wasn't really good, I was constantly stopping him because it felt like I needed to go to the bathroom even if I prep'd before (don't worry I've already done my research about this and know that this is normal), so he got annoyed or tired of trying, he just told me ""you know what?, that's it"" and took off the condom. When he did that I felt like shit, like I suck for bottoming and wanted to disappear right away, he jacked off and finished.

After that moment he changed a lot, became really distant (this happened on monday 29th), didn't called me at all, etc. I know that this kind of things happen, like, it was a hook up, even if before he was behaving different, some sort of looking-for-a-relationship behavior.
Anyway, the problem is not with him, is with me. I think I have a crush with this guy, I'm always thinking about him, getting on tinder just to know at what time was his last connection, or even reading again all of our conversations (I'm not sure if this is because he was the first guy I had anal sex with). Right now, he just answers texts with one or two words, not following a conversation which is obviously a sign of reject. I don't know what to do, can you please give some advice to this little bro whose feeling like shit?

About a month ago, my boyfriend broke up with me, essentially for being too needy and clingy and depending on him with my anxiety problems. The next day we talked and got back together deciding to take it easy on seeing each other during the week so we could sort out or problems, he told me after he broke up with me he couldn't imagine his life without me in it. We made up and things felt a lot better. I started seeing a therapist that week to help with my anxiety and started meditating daily (both of which have been very helpful).

The following weeks however I'd occasionally get very anxious about when we'd text or talk on the phone and I'd over analyze our communication, nervous he was going to break up with me again. When we're in person together things feel good and fairly normal. We both went back home (families are different parts of the US) for Christmas and during Christmas I felt great (20-26th), I wasn't anxious about us and whatnot. Then on the 27th I realized we hadn't talked on the phone at all during this break (we're not back to school until the 6th) and had felt like I've been waiting for him to want to talk because I didn't want to come off as needy or clingy. Finally on the 28th I asked him if we could talk cuz I missed him and we did talk for a while.

For some reason since then I've just been feeling like he's not into me or our relationship anymore. Idk if it's all in my head or not, but for example I'll say ""I miss you"" and he'll say he misses me back but it's almost like I don't believe him, it's almost like I'm waiting for him to say it to me. Idk it really might all be in my head but I can't continue feeling this way in our relationship. Sorry if I'm coming off as whiny, I just feel like our relationship has changed.

We made up and things felt a lot better. I started seeing a therapist that week to help with my anxiety and started meditating daily (both of which have been very helpful).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following weeks however I&amp;#39;d occasionally get very anxious about when we&amp;#39;d text or talk on the phone and I&amp;#39;d over analyze our communication, nervous he was going to break up with me again. When we&amp;#39;re in person together things feel good and fairly normal. We both went back home (families are different parts of the US) for Christmas and during Christmas I felt great (20-26th), I wasn&amp;#39;t anxious about us and whatnot. Then on the 27th I realized we hadn&amp;#39;t talked on the phone at all during this break (we&amp;#39;re not back to school until the 6th) and had felt like I&amp;#39;ve been waiting for him to want to talk because I didn&amp;#39;t want to come off as needy or clingy. Finally on the 28th I asked him if we could talk cuz I missed him and we did talk for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some reason since then I&amp;#39;ve just been feeling like he&amp;#39;s not into me or our relationship anymore. Idk if it&amp;#39;s all in my head or not, but for example I&amp;#39;ll say &amp;quot;I miss you&amp;quot; and he&amp;#39;ll say he misses me back but it&amp;#39;s almost like I don&amp;#39;t believe him, it&amp;#39;s almost like I&amp;#39;m waiting for him to say it to me. Idk it really might all be in my head but I can&amp;#39;t continue feeling this way in our relationship. Sorry if I&amp;#39;m coming off as whiny, I just feel like our relationship has changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: worried my boyfriend just isn&amp;#39;t into me anymore or I&amp;#39;m not important anymore&lt;/p&gt;

I've always had little confidence and low self esteem, but this worsened last year after someone I considered a close friend basically turned psycho and made things a whole lot worse.

This guy was my housemate, he tried to turn my friends against me by making up a heap of lies that he'd constantly feed them when I wasn't around, he stole small things from my room to try and convince me I was going mad, stole my passport when it arrived to try and stop me going on holiday and basically made my life miserable. Luckily all the lies and maliciousness caught up with him an it all became uncovered. When I confronted him about it all he literally ignored me and shut himself away in his room. I tried talking to him several times, as did some of my friends but he shut us all out and then one day suddenly moved out without any warning, which was actually a huge relief in some ways. Despite being gone for almost a year he still seems to be feeding these lies to other mutual friends and claiming he's the victim in all of this, and he's very smart in the way which he does it.

Since this has all happened I've lost even more confidence and self-esteem, I have a hard job trusting people, I don't enjoy socialising and despite doing nothing wrong I worry that I'll bump into my old housemate and his partner and they'll make life hell for me again. I feel like I've lost my way, having someone I thought was a close friend turn against me has made me question everything, even down to my career.

Laying by the pool, swimming, good food and drinks sounds pretty great! What are the pros and cons of taking a gay cruise over a non specified cruise? 

My boyfriend is worried that a gay cruise will involve endless gay judgment and drama basically like a two week long circuit party. 

I'm worried a 'straight' cruise is going to be endless straight judgment and people from the Midwest being uncomfortable around us being a couple. 

I'd appreciate any help you may have! ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;For our past few vacations my boyfriend and I have gone on crazy fun adventures. &lt;/p&gt;

So taking a physical look at this guy he's pretty....hefty. So I load up my old biggercity account and there he is.  a couple of years ago (before me getting married) he was one of many that I traded pics with and maybe chatted with.

So, come to find out he's actually married, with a wife and kids. His profile always said gay so I didn't think about that.  I'm not sure he's realized where we ""meet"". We never exchanged real names and this was like 9 years ago or so.

I have a feeling that he is going to remember, eventually it will happen and we will have to address the elephant in the room. 

I think as far as proffesionalism goes, I'm not bringing this up at all to him. I think it will be more appropriate for him to address it. I'm not a blackmail type of person so I'm not even going to hang that over his head. 

Telling my husband about this? I may need some help on that. Do I tell him ? do I not? Should I care?

This is seriously the most bizarre situation I've had to deal with.
