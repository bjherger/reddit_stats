I never thought that I would post a link with such a title. I never thought I would find myself in this position, but I have. And now, I am here asking for advice, help, guidance, anything. Let me start at the beginning... I'll try to keep it short.

Me and my SO had been dating for over a year, moved in together, got engaged, worked together, built a life around each other. This was by far the happiest time in my life, and I knew then that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with him. A year isn't much in the grand scheme of things, but a lot happens in that time. Demons come out, and we definitely saw each other's. 

Eventually, I needed to relocate to one of the gayest cities in Europe for a 5-month period. Leading up to the move was tough. We fought of course because we knew how horrible it would be to be so far apart with the temptation of fucking other men. Nonetheless, we dealt with it and moved forward. In our long-distance relationship, we skyped and messaged every day. He came and visited me for a long weekend. Despite all of this, our relationship suffered. It's not that we fought. It's that we didn't. Our interaction took on a superficial tone. I became incredibly depressed here from the pressure of work, life and living in a whole new world.

At some point, I met the other guy. We slowly became friends, and of course, he was beautiful and confident. I set boundaries however, determined to be faithful to my boyfriend. I even told my boyfriend about him, my fears of cheating on him with the other guy. My boyfriend accepted that but advised me to keep my distance from compromising situations. The other guy turned out to have ulterior motives, and I, in my fear and desire, became weak to his allure. Several months passed by and I had sex with the other guy. And then we tried to have sex again before I broke down. This point was extremely low, and I realized the only thing to do was tell my boyfriend what had happened. 

After an hour and a half of tears and yelling, I have not heard from him since. It has been less than a week, but I have realized this week that I am not ready to put our relationship to rest--whatever that may be. What I did was horrible and inexcusable. I have forgiven myself for what I have done. I am not the cheater who hid his relationship. I am not the cheater who lived on grindr and scruff, fucking anything moving. But I did cheat. I broke the trust we had. The worst part is that I broke his heart. I've sent him a long, heartfelt email in hopes that it will help him grieve and bring us closer together. Whether that is to repair our relationship or say our goodbyes... I do not know, but maybe the community here has something to say. 

And finally, to those who are cheating or are thinking about it: talk to your partner. No matter what. If you do not, you will break yourself spiritually. You will lose touch with yourself. Although I am sad at this point, my life is not beyond repair. You are not a horrible being for cheating. 

TL;DR

Here's the scoop:

I'm a 19M, and at this point, I know I have an attraction to guys. When I get hard and masturbate I'm almost exclusively thinking about men. I can get hard pretty easily just to the thought of being with another guy. I WANT to come out. I want to get out there and have a boyfriend, and I have a feeling that being a virgin might help me be more open to experimenting. I even know that most, if not all the people in my life right now would be accepting and supportive of me. But the thing is: I can't. Every time I want to or even try (I attempted to come out to a friend but panic soon after and made up some excuse about confusing feelings, I know it's BAD) I think on it and then back out and feel sort of...regretful. Regretting that I had those thoughts, denying that I really feel that way. It's like a day/night ""switch"" that gets flipped (I do most of my thinking in bed at night, so the feelings come then and the regret and denial the next morning). And another thing holding me back is my vision of the future. Every time I imagine what my life will be like in 5-10 years, it's the same thing: I'm with a woman (every time it's my best friend, the only girl I've ever had ""feelings"" for, in a high school crush kind of way*) with kids. I desperately want kids of my own someday, and someday rather soon. I just am not sure how to deal with this. Thoughts?

I have told my family and they were accepting and the friends that I have told have all been great. It took me a long time to come to terms with it all and as such at 22 years old I have not really had any experience in terms of dating, liking guys etc.

Anyway, my road to accepting and coming out as gay started when I met a friend through my other mutual friends who happened to be openly gay. I was not out to a single person at this stage but immediately I felt some sort of weird chemistry. It was all of the obvious signs such as extended eye contact etc. After maybe 6 months of this awkward tension we ended up kissing one night and I was finally able to say that yes that is what I liked. Anyway, we have been hooking up for a while every now and again but nothing serious usually just making out, cuddling etc. This usually only happens when we are drunk. The other night I was really sick of the confusion surrounding everything and sent him a drunken text message that pretty much did not make sense. I told him how I liked him but that I was confused about our whole relationship as we hardly talk when we are not hooking up in secret. I was so drunk though so I just came across as a desperate, clingy loser. He replied and said he just wanted to be friends. I am fine with that but just need to know how I am supposed to stop myself from doing things like that. I don't want to be the clingy, annoying guy but I think it is just because I have never been through anything like this.

Sorry if this does not make sense. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;

This evening, we had a chat about our relationship and where we think it's going.

Background: We both live with our parents and never lived with one another. For one year of our relationship it was long distance. We both love each other and we both feel happy with where our relationship is at the moment. I have a much higher sex drive than he has and we have had some problems with regards to this (and is the reason we had our talk earlier tonight). We are taking our relationship slowly and it hasn't progressed to the next level (moving in together) because we both don't have the finances at the moment and we'd both prefer to live by ourselves for a while before moving in with each other.

He said that he feels he doesn't know if he sees a future with us together. He says since we're both young (in our 20s) that he feels like we are both missing out being with other guys. He also said that he loves me and is happy with our relationship at the moment and that he could see us ending up being together forever but he doesn't want to live life regretting what could have been with someone else.

I feel happy with our relationship and I do love him. I am very comfortable with where we are at the moment even though we are moving quite slowly. I get annoyed by the lack of sex sometimes but it's not a huge issue. I feel like yes, we are both missing out by being together but I would like to keep going out with him as long as we're both happy with each other.

It kind of threw me off guard that he's considering ending the relationship even the we love each other and we're happy with the relationship. He says what he's unhappy about is that we've tied ourselves down with one another (and he said he wouldn't be comfortable with an open relationship). He said in the past that the opportunity arose for him to have sex with other people and he didn't like that he couldn't go with it because he was going out with me.

Really, I just don't know what to feel. He says he's happy with the relationship but is considering ending it because he thinks there's a chance he could be happier with someone else and he feels like he's missing out on sewing some wild oats. I feel happy with the relationship and don't want to break up because I think if we both love each other and we're both happy I think it could be a huge mistake for me and for him to end it. I would feel different if he said he wasn't happy in the relationship at all. I would (reluctantly) accept a break up because I don't want him to be unhappy. But he is happy with me. I'm just... not sure what to feel except confusion. I would really appreciate an outsiders perspective.

Sorry for the wall of text. Hopefully it makes sense, I'm kind of all over the place at the moment.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So my bf and I have been going out for 3 years.

As a child I had angry outbursts all the time. Instead of trying to get the root of the problem, the people charged with helping simply rammed it into my head to just keep it inside. Since then I always run away from confrontation, half because I'm afraid of blowing up even when its called for, and half because I'm just too damn afraid that I won't be able to defend myself properly.

Whenever I'm slighted, resentment and anger just kind of swirls within me for days and weeks on end simply because I'm too afraid of what I will ultimately do if I allow myself to show my emotions, but even more so because I'm afraid how others will react.

Essentially, I'm a hyper emotional wimp that runs from confrontation when its called for, and the welled up emotion ultimately culminates in confrontations over subjects that are really trivial. On one thread on here, one commenter mentioned how the OP seemed to allow one person's word to have tremendous power over them and that's exactly how I ultimately feel to the point where I obsesses over slights to the point of having very unhealthy thoughts...all because I'm just too afraid of confrontation, being yelled at...and the like.

A situation I am dealing with now, is a perfect example of this. A few weeks ago I got into a spat with my boss. I was completely in the wrong in regards to the situation. Regardless the way my boss approached regarding the matter was completely unnecessary in my book. Instead of calling him out on it in a productive and professional manner, I simply ignored it for fear of starting a confrontation. Now a few weeks later I really have no interest in confronting my boss over our meeting. There is not point in it, but my wimpy nature is making it where I dread going to work now. I can't look him in the eye and avoid him at all costs.

A real man would have gotten over this, instead I'm wallowing in self pity and trying to run away. Please help me stop being such a overemotional wimp.

TL;DR I'm a big wimp and its starting to show at work.
