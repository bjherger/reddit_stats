TLDR: I'm scared, have no clue what anything means, but I'm gay and I'm happy to accept that now

 ***It is Thursday, December 4th, 2014. Yesterday I finished reading Robbie Rogers memoir, Coming Out to Play, and it forced me to finally realize who I am. So today I wrote my letter to you. I don’t know when I will share it, probably once I actually know for sure what I am. That could be next month, next year, or never, I just know for certain that it is not now. A lot of things may have changed since I wrote this letter, and I hope all that change is for the better. When you read this, I want you to understand that although I would like to tell you all in person, I just wouldn’t be able to say it like this. This letter has my true feelings in it, my raw feelings, which I have not shared with anyone. I haven’t talked with anyone about this, or asked anyone for advice. However, by the time you read this, I most likely will have, because I cannot imagine being sure about such an important moment in life, without talking to people that will be able to help. Not that any of you wouldn’t be able to help, just not in the same way that a close friend, or someone working with the school may. Although at times when reading this or thinking about it, it may look as though I have had a choice in this decision. I can assure that I did not have a choice in who I am, it was decided 19 years ago, however it is only now that I made the choice to accept who I am. Living your life in denial and fear is certainly not fun, and it has a major impact on your emotional health and well-being, so I am done doing that. I still have a lot more to do in order to know for sure, but eventually I know that I will get there. I hope you understand that although I would love to call you up, or see you and tell you this in person, I just can’t right now. Do you remember when I went to Camp ______ for the first time, and we were sitting eating breakfast, and I could barely eat anything because of how nervous I was? Up until now, I think that was the most nervous that I had ever been. Back then I was scared about leaving you and moving out of my comfort zone. Now, I am scared about coming to you and again moving out of my comfort zone. So far, I haven’t told you what this letter is about, however you may have already figured it out, either now or a long time ago. Either way, I explain everything below, how I am feeling, the challenges, why now, and finally what it is that I am. I know that you may ask why make you read all of this when the three words that only truly matter are tucked deep inside the letter. The answer is that it doesn’t feel right to say it without this explanation, without explaining why I couldn’t earlier, and why I felt so afraid. In reality, this barely scratches the surface of my emotions. I’m not lying when I say that I cried as I wrote this. I was scared, and I just wanted to hide in a corner and be by myself. I of course realize now that that was clearly the wrong decision, but at the time that was the only thing that made me feel better, being in my room with my door closed, my roommate outside, and listening to some Guster or OAR, music that has always calmed me down. So now, after having written more than 1800 words, I think it is enough. Feel free to ask me any questions that you have once you are done reading it all, and I’d be glad to answer them. I would not have sent this to you if I didn’t think that I was. But in reality, I just want you to read it, say I love you, and that be it. But I realize that this wouldn’t be fair to you. You have known me for my whole life, been there for me for my while life, and you deserve to know what my life truly is. I am happy now, happier than I have ever been, because I am no longer trying to hide, ignore or change what really is a part of me. It has been a difficult journey, one that I didn’t even begin to accept until last summer, and didn’t actually believe until today. All that being said, enjoy the read, and I look forward to the future.*** 

Dear Mom, Dad, and Brother, 
            It feels as though my whole life I have been living a lie, to you, my fiends, and most importantly myself. I have tried to deny it, change it, and ignore it, and yet the same feeling keeps coming back. It's not a bad thing, just different, and I have to say, it's something that has scared me. What if I'm not like everybody else, what will they say, will they view me differently, treat me differently? My whole life I’ve grown up thinking about what a normal life is like. I don’t want to be different, I don’t want to feel different, but I do. I am, and I always have been. Since elementary school on up, I’ve always felt a little different. For a while I didn’t know what it was, and I didn’t think much of it, besides a few thoughts in the back of my mind. And that’s where I tried to keep it, in the back of my mind. I figured that if I ignored it long enough, it would simply go away. But I was wrong. This last semester has been rough. I’ve felt disconnected from so many things and so many people, because I felt like I couldn’t be honest with them, especially if I wasn’t being honest with myself. I felt like I could not tell any of my fraternity brothers; I didn’t feel close enough because I had always been trying to keep some distance, so I wouldn’t have to face the truth. I felt like I couldn’t tell you guys that I was confused, and just feeling down, because you would ask questions that quite frankly, I would not or could not answer. I couldn’t be honest with myself, because that meant that I would have to accept what and who I was, which is hard to do when you realize that what and who you are is different from what you’ve been trying to believe your whole life. So this semester, I tried to discover who I really was, without telling anyone what I was trying to do. Unfortunately, I ended up isolating myself, so I wouldn’t have to try to be something that I wasn’t. For a while, it didn’t help, I was still extremely confused. Then I read a book. I was still trying to find answers when I decided to get it, and within a few pages I felt a connection, like I had experienced so much of the same thing that this guy had been going through. But he kept it a secret, hid it from himself and his family until he was 25, and it destroyed him. He just couldn’t live a normal life while hiding his true self. I identified so much with him, not necessarily the details of his life, but what he felt growing up, and what he felt he had to do to hide is true self. In some ways I’ve done the same. The passage below has truly helped me realize what I am, because I think I had the same exact experience. 

            “I had a sense that I was different from other boys. In elementary school I’d hear my friends talk about girlfriends and I couldn’t relate to it. I wasn’t excited about the idea of having a girlfriend and couldn’t understand why they were. I thought that maybe I was just afraid, but at first I couldn’t put my finger on what the problem was.” And, “when I watched movies or TV shows I was always more attracted to the guy characters than the girl characters and didn’t know why.”- Coming Out to Play, Robbie Rogers, pg. 35
   I’m tired of hiding, of being scared of who I am. I am Gay, and I am proud of it. Am I scared of what the future holds, absolutely, but I feel better knowing that I can talk to you guys about it. This is who I am, and I can no longer hide it, no longer pretend to be something that I am not. I don’t know that the future holds, I don’t think that I act gay, whatever that means, and I don’t think people really would guess that I am. I still have a lot to learn, a lot to discover about myself, and maybe this isn’t the end of my journey in discovering who I am. Yet right now, this is truly how to describe me and my interests. It’s weird, and as I said, I don’t know what the future holds, and maybe things will change. But for now, this is me. I haven’t told anybody else yet, and I’d appreciate it if you didn’t either. I don’t want to publicly come out of the closet, I mean its not like people come out as straight, and that’s not what I am trying to do in this letter. Maybe this was mostly written for myself, as I continue to accept me for who I am, but every word in here is the truth. I can’t write how I’ve felt for the last 19 years, how isolated I think I have been, and how hard it has been to get to this point, so trust me when I say that it wasn’t easy. I’m not afraid of any of you not accepting who I am, you have always loved me and supported me through everything that I have done and been through, because that is simply what families do. So thank you, thanks for all you have done and will continue to do. Thank you for reading this, because it certainly was not easy to write, but at the same time, it all needed to be said, at least I think it did. 

Love your Son and Brother, 
","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I haven&amp;#39;t come out yet, and no clue if or when I am going to, but I was feeling really stressed and anxious so I felt like I needed to do something, so I wrote it down, just to try and help me. I don&amp;#39;t think that this is how I would actually come out, but it just felt good to write it all out, read it if you want and let me know what you think... or not, its really really long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR: I&amp;#39;m scared, have no clue what anything means, but I&amp;#39;m gay and I&amp;#39;m happy to accept that now&lt;/p&gt;

That could be next month, next year, or never, I just know for certain that it is not now. A lot of things may have changed since I wrote this letter, and I hope all that change is for the better. When you read this, I want you to understand that although I would like to tell you all in person, I just wouldn’t be able to say it like this. This letter has my true feelings in it, my raw feelings, which I have not shared with anyone. I haven’t talked with anyone about this, or asked anyone for advice. However, by the time you read this, I most likely will have, because I cannot imagine being sure about such an important moment in life, without talking to people that will be able to help. Not that any of you wouldn’t be able to help, just not in the same way that a close friend, or someone working with the school may. Although at times when reading this or thinking about it, it may look as though I have had a choice in this decision. I can assure that I did not have a choice in who I am, it was decided 19 years ago, however it is only now that I made the choice to accept who I am. Living your life in denial and fear is certainly not fun, and it has a major impact on your emotional health and well-being, so I am done doing that. I still have a lot more to do in order to know for sure, but eventually I know that I will get there. I hope you understand that although I would love to call you up, or see you and tell you this in person, I just can’t right now. Do you remember when I went to Camp ______ for the first time, and we were sitting eating breakfast, and I could barely eat anything because of how nervous I was? Up until now, I think that was the most nervous that I had ever been. Back then I was scared about leaving you and moving out of my comfort zone. Now, I am scared about coming to you and again moving out of my comfort zone. So far, I haven’t told you what this letter is about, however you may have already figured it out, either now or a long time ago. Either way, I explain everything below, how I am feeling, the challenges, why now, and finally what it is that I am. I know that you may ask why make you read all of this when the three words that only truly matter are tucked deep inside the letter. The answer is that it doesn’t feel right to say it without this explanation, without explaining why I couldn’t earlier, and why I felt so afraid. In reality, this barely scratches the surface of my emotions. I’m not lying when I say that I cried as I wrote this. I was scared, and I just wanted to hide in a corner and be by myself. I of course realize now that that was clearly the wrong decision, but at the time that was the only thing that made me feel better, being in my room with my door closed, my roommate outside, and listening to some Guster or OAR, music that has always calmed me down. So now, after having written more than 1800 words, I think it is enough. Feel free to ask me any questions that you have once you are done reading it all, and I’d be glad to answer them. I would not have sent this to you if I didn’t think that I was. But in reality, I just want you to read it, say I love you, and that be it. But I realize that this wouldn’t be fair to you. You have known me for my whole life, been there for me for my while life, and you deserve to know what my life truly is. I am happy now, happier than I have ever been, because I am no longer trying to hide, ignore or change what really is a part of me. It has been a difficult journey, one that I didn’t even begin to accept until last summer, and didn’t actually believe until today. All that being said, enjoy the read, and I look forward to the future.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear Mom, Dad, and Brother, 
            It feels as though my whole life I have been living a lie, to you, my fiends, and most importantly myself. I have tried to deny it, change it, and ignore it, and yet the same feeling keeps coming back. It&amp;#39;s not a bad thing, just different, and I have to say, it&amp;#39;s something that has scared me. What if I&amp;#39;m not like everybody else, what will they say, will they view me differently, treat me differently? My whole life I’ve grown up thinking about what a normal life is like. I don’t want to be different, I don’t want to feel different, but I do. I am, and I always have been. Since elementary school on up, I’ve always felt a little different. For a while I didn’t know what it was, and I didn’t think much of it, besides a few thoughts in the back of my mind. And that’s where I tried to keep it, in the back of my mind. I figured that if I ignored it long enough, it would simply go away. But I was wrong. This last semester has been rough. I’ve felt disconnected from so many things and so many people, because I felt like I couldn’t be honest with them, especially if I wasn’t being honest with myself. I felt like I could not tell any of my fraternity brothers; I didn’t feel close enough because I had always been trying to keep some distance, so I wouldn’t have to face the truth. I felt like I couldn’t tell you guys that I was confused, and just feeling down, because you would ask questions that quite frankly, I would not or could not answer. I couldn’t be honest with myself, because that meant that I would have to accept what and who I was, which is hard to do when you realize that what and who you are is different from what you’ve been trying to believe your whole life. So this semester, I tried to discover who I really was, without telling anyone what I was trying to do. Unfortunately, I ended up isolating myself, so I wouldn’t have to try to be something that I wasn’t. For a while, it didn’t help, I was still extremely confused. Then I read a book. I was still trying to find answers when I decided to get it, and within a few pages I felt a connection, like I had experienced so much of the same thing that this guy had been going through. But he kept it a secret, hid it from himself and his family until he was 25, and it destroyed him. He just couldn’t live a normal life while hiding his true self. I identified so much with him, not necessarily the details of his life, but what he felt growing up, and what he felt he had to do to hide is true self. In some ways I’ve done the same. The passage below has truly helped me realize what I am, because I think I had the same exact experience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;        “I had a sense that I was different from other boys. In elementary school I’d hear my friends talk about girlfriends and I couldn’t relate to it. I wasn’t excited about the idea of having a girlfriend and couldn’t understand why they were. I thought that maybe I was just afraid, but at first I couldn’t put my finger on what the problem was.” And, “when I watched movies or TV shows I was always more attracted to the guy characters than the girl characters and didn’t know why.”- Coming Out to Play, Robbie Rogers, pg. 35
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m tired of hiding, of being scared of who I am. I am Gay, and I am proud of it. Am I scared of what the future holds, absolutely, but I feel better knowing that I can talk to you guys about it. This is who I am, and I can no longer hide it, no longer pretend to be something that I am not. I don’t know that the future holds, I don’t think that I act gay, whatever that means, and I don’t think people really would guess that I am. I still have a lot to learn, a lot to discover about myself, and maybe this isn’t the end of my journey in discovering who I am. Yet right now, this is truly how to describe me and my interests. It’s weird, and as I said, I don’t know what the future holds, and maybe things will change. But for now, this is me. I haven’t told anybody else yet, and I’d appreciate it if you didn’t either. I don’t want to publicly come out of the closet, I mean its not like people come out as straight, and that’s not what I am trying to do in this letter. Maybe this was mostly written for myself, as I continue to accept me for who I am, but every word in here is the truth. I can’t write how I’ve felt for the last 19 years, how isolated I think I have been, and how hard it has been to get to this point, so trust me when I say that it wasn’t easy. I’m not afraid of any of you not accepting who I am, you have always loved me and supported me through everything that I have done and been through, because that is simply what families do. So thank you, thanks for all you have done and will continue to do. Thank you for reading this, because it certainly was not easy to write, but at the same time, it all needed to be said, at least I think it did. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Love your Son and Brother, &lt;/p&gt;

BACKGROUND:

I'm 23 year old, attractive sometimes shy/bold next door type of guy and i've been recieving compliments since i was a little kid from ladies
i guess i have some magical charm, i'm not a stud by any means (i'm lean and short) although i have very masculine features
like hairness, so i'm like a mix of cuteness and  manlyness.. i guess they call them otters these days LOL.

I've been always around men in high school and university too since there's few women in my field of study.

I sort of can get people to be more friendly/protective/flirty  and men often compliment me,and say so many nice things... which i find VERY WEIRD, not because a man cannot appreciate other males, but because not even women say to me those things...and because i live in a very conservative/homophobic coutry and that's pretty funny, like a double standard.

So the thing is.. sometimes these guys seem ""charmed"" and are very friendly or even flirty but, when i try to make some kind of move they tell me that they are straight, one time i sensed sexual tension with a friend who seemed obviously curious, but when i tried something very subtle... he didn't go with flow, probably scared to go bi and i lost my patience (he also had a gf).


CURRENT SITUATION:

Hot teacher. Visiting for a year.(not his student)
We officialy met in a 2 day  event and he seemed very warm (put his hand over a chair for me to sit by his side cause there was no other place), and kind aloof too.
At the end of day 1 as i was leaving he literally called me from 5 feet away and say ""Bye man"" with a big smile and hand waving while he was talking to another girl teacher, that was weird and i was a 14 year old girl.

He doesn't seem to be really extroverted, though. He is always on his own.
At the end of day 2 i heard him giving his number toa slutty looking girl, so i said forget it.straight.

We now bump into each other a lot. And he always does his intense thing with smiles and everything, we lock eyes, sometimes is quick and but not entirely cold.
I mean, i see him coming and  while he walks i'm looking bored prettending i'm not checking him out, and he does his thing. 

As i side note, i did see him talking on the street to a typical high school femmy skinny twink... but he is an english teacher and the kid has a good english... who knows how that connection happened... anyway

He might as well be bi, but...How should i approach situations like this? 

Usually,guys are straight forward and serious when they are not interested in men... i mean this kind of interaction says everything to a gay man, but for me sometimes has turn to be very ambiguous...
I know i'm lacking in the game department...but still i need some advice, guys :)

So, there's this one kid who's in my major who I have openly discussed with both my guy and girl friends as being the (in my opinion) most attractive guy in our major.  I'm openly out to everyone in my classes, and we all really know each other seeing as how this is a rather small department, so it's no mystery to these people.  

For the past three semesters, I've caught this kid looking at me a lot, and I'm not the kind of person who's afraid to look back. Whenever I'd catch his glimpse, I'd look back, and he'd look away.  I didn't think anything of it at first, but every Monday and Wednesday, when we were in a class that we -sorta- sat next to each other, I'd catch him staring at me at least 5 times a class, and I'd always looks back, only to have his eyes run away.

Not the point of the story, though.  This semester, he and I swapped numbers and often discussed answers to homework for this one class, so we became closer.  Lo and behold, he came out to me in early November, and he's been slowly making his way out to other people.  When my friends found out, they were excited for me because I could ""finally have the chance with him"", seeing as how yada yada yada, but there's this lingering thought in the back of my mind that's stopping me...

I'm afraid to see people who are ""fresh"" in the gay world.

Not for the reasons most people may think, like not being able to hold hands in public with each other, or having them be inexperienced in ""gay sex"", or whatever...

I'm afraid that I'll grow attached to them, and they to me, but then one day in the future, they may want to see more of the world.

I've had my fun being single.  I've seen plenty of guys, I've spoken to plenty of people, I've done what I've wanted to, so I've let all the steam out of my system.  This kid who just openly admitted to me he was gay, and has recently started trying to talk to me a lot more often, hasn't, and I'm very, very afraid to take him in with open arms, to later be thrown in the backburner after he's come to 100% acceptance so he can see what the rest of the gay world has to offer.  

So I'm purposely keeping him at a distance so I don't do anything with him.

My friends think I'm absolutely crazy, but I really can't find it in myself to invest in someone who's newly out, that I know I could probably develop feelings for (he's honestly a great guy--and super smart, too!), because I'm just not about that.

I guess I'm on here for more of a rant kinda thing, but honestly I'm angry with myself more than anything, so... does what I'm saying make any sense? Am I being stupid? :\

Here is the thing: he has a big Golden Retriever dog that he is like in love with, and I hate it. Not just his dog, but I just don't like dogs or any animals for that matter. They are fine in the zoo or whatever, but I would never live with an animal. They shed, and don't poop in toilets, and make noise, and eat nasty food. Regardless, they are not something I like near me. I don't really go to his place for that reason.

He wants to move in, and I want him too as well. I am willing to compromise on some things, however no dog is welcome anywhere that I am living, no exceptions!

How do I express to him that if we are gonna live together, that it will be without the dog? He REALLY loves the damn thing..I've never had pets so I don't get the obsession.

If he wants to keep it then we cannot move in together. And, for me the whole point of dating is to have a future with someone that includes cohabitation. So basically it's at the point where if he doesn't get rid of that beast we will be breaking up.

I've been dating a guy for 10 weeks, he's amazing. 
Well the thing is that I kind of cheated on him with my best friend and when he asked about our relationship (my friend and I) I lied.

I couldn't stand it anymore and yesterday I told him the truth.

I was in a very dark place when I met this guy, and he helped me to realize I was fucking my life up (not on a explicit way, but I realized what falling in love is).

I'm changing, for real. 

I'm aware that I failed, I was supposed to make him feel loved and I'm hurting him.


He asked for some time, he told me not to guess anything, and to wait for his decision, he also said that I was a good boy but I disappointed him.

I am really sorry. Deep inside my heart I know I did the right thing, I must be honest with him; I just hope he gives me a second chance.

I also talked with my friend last night, he agreed that shit was really wrong and that we are going to behave like friends for now on. It's a fucking sick relationship.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi reddit, I need some advice, or I just need to get it out.&lt;/p&gt;
