I'm one of those people who writes long walls of texts, so grab a bucket of popcorn if you get bored easily. Apologies in advance for probably wasting your time.

So like most of you bros, I'm what you would call ""homosexual"" and I've yet to let the cat out of the bag. You see, the school I go to has a bitter environment when it comes to opposing the norm, and doesn't take too kindly to people like me. I expected this when I started my year here, but somehow, it's gotten worse than what I had initially anticipated. I have indirectly and directly experienced harassment upon peers I have never met before and betrayal by those I thought I trusted. Ultimately, I feel guilty for allowing myself to fall victim to petty harassment, but at the same time I cannot escape the engrained feeling of helplessness. I'm lost in a world I thought I could take on.

So after a while, I notice my grades start to tip over due to depression kicking in. All at once I shut down and come up with every excuse to stay home. I constantly apply denial and lie about my sexuality, rejecting any and all attempts to submit. At this point, I've backed myself into a corner and I stopped talking to my bf to avoid believing that my sexuality is correct (yes, I literally tried to make myself believe that I'm not gay). Annoyed with my own ignorance, I wrote an anonymous letter to the school principal, my case manager and the district's mental health guide (I forget the correct term, sorry) with no progress. The principal and my case manager only offered to meet me directly in person, but knowing them, I don't trust they will keep anything confidential.

I don't know what to do anymore. I can't get myself to believe in something I'm not and when I ask for help, I feel as if no one cares. I'm incredibly lost and my grades are crashing harder than ever, leaving my utterly destroyed at the end of the day. I'm left with a few options, but none of them are ones I want to take seriously, at least not yet.

So reddit, are there any suggestions you may have? What am I doing wrong and how can I fix it? Again, I apologize for boring you with this long wall of text.

If you know of a better sub, feel free to point me in the right direction. That being said, I'll also post to other subs. The reasonI'm asking here is because this sub seems to be a more active community.

Secondly, this (at least to me) is a very unusual topic and proposition but it is very real. I'm not here to be bashed. But feel free to give an honest opinion and thought on the matter. 

Okay... So I'm a straight married man in my mid 30s. My wife is closer to 40. We've been trying to conceive for a very long time to no avail. Recently found out some bad news that she's unable to conceive. My sperm is fertile and ready to go! Needless to say, we're both bummed out about the matter but me way more so than her. I'm a real family oriented guy and she could really careless about having a child. I honestly think she was trying mainly for me.

Anyways, we looked into artificial insemination of a surrogate which is tremendously expensive. Then we looked at adoption although quite frankly, I am more set on having my own (I understand how people may view this but it's just how I feel). With that mindset, I thought back to a surrogate but began thinking more in terms of natural conception. I mean, why should the scientist and doctors get all the money for acting as middle men?

Further thought on the matter brought me to the lesbian community. It seems that if I found a lesbian couple in a similar situation of wanting a child of their own, we can both do favors for each other. We can plan to conceive two children. Upon proper contractual stipulations outlined by an attorney, we can draft how one child would go to its own family to which each family has sole custody and responsibilty of the child under their care. For each couple will have no worries of baby momma/daddy drama or financial obligations for the other child. The child will be raised without any knowledge of the situation.

My question is... is this a sound plan? I know this is totally unorthodox but is it also ludicrous? Are there lesbian couples that would actually consent to such arrangement? 

The main purpose of these questions is because if I find this to be a highly unacceptable practice, there's no need for me to pursue it. If there is a possibility that a lesbian couple would be interested, I'll  look deeper into the matter and see about pursuing it.

By the way... NO, THIS IS NOT AN ATTEMPT TO HAVE SEX WITH A LESBIAN! In all seriousness, it's a genuine question in hopes of two couples having a chance to raise a baby as their own child without outside influence or an unnecessary exorbitant startup cost.

That's a completely different story. He's private so even when I came out to him he never said anything back. I've always given him space until tonight. He pops up on Grindr, and yes I've seen him before. But he blocked me ages ago. He got a new phone so maybe the block reset? This time I can see him and instinctively block him. 

Anyway, this guy called Alex I really like messages me to ask if I have two profiles on Grindr. I say no and just play dumb, I know exactly what he's talking about. He's talking to my brother and sends me screen caps and I confirm it's him. I'm nervous now and tell him it would be weird for me when he suggests a threesome. We talk a bit more and I tell him I really liked him at one point and he responds as he always does. This guy has never wanted a relationship and it took me over a year to get over that. It hurt when he told me I wasn't ""right"" person/gender. 

Eventually he tells me to go ask my bro if he's on grindr. My brother said no and makes a funny face, I knew at this point it wasn't my place to push him. I ask Alex not to have sex with my brother and he agrees even though my brother is keen after the fact he knows I've had sex with this dude! I just don't like the idea. And this guy gave me an STD and doesn't like to use condoms either. He only cares about sex.

I am jealous I'll admit, but who wants their brother boning someone they like? Even though Alex and I were just friends with benefits I know this dude is gonna bang my brother behind my back. I called my other friend and she said I should tell my brother how I feel, but Alex tells me to say nothing because he talked with my brother and wants to protect his privacy now.

Introduced through friends, we hit it off immediately. I mean my names Jesse and his is James! We were a great match, We have countless stories good and bad, and in the long run, I really thought he could be the one. 
 I mean that, and I know he feels the same. I live in Hawaii and the last few months have gotten harder with the idea of moving to the mainland, and we talked about it a lot when we were going good. I mean we've worked together in 2 jobs, and we were just fine. We agreed to try for it, so I found a place with my friend so we could move in together and gain experience living together (before we move 2.5 thousand miles away). However we started to have a lot of stressful fights, and he would come over a lot but never officially moved in, so he was paying rent at his friends place but pretty much living with me.  Around then his sister moved here from another island with family issues and to be closer to him, and my brother started to get into trouble with drugs. In addition, his grandpa was diagnosed with lung cancer. 
Having finished school I was starting to realize that I was getting nowhere working here, and we, as well as one of my friends agreed to move to washington at the beginning of may (currently a month away). At the time it seemed like a great idea, but as time went by, we started to fight more, with the added tension of wanting to move together, we started to have terrible fights, yet followed by really passionate times. I started to really feel lost. I invested literally all my time in him because i am the only one with a car and we live 20 miles apart and work is 20 miles from either of us. Picking him up, bringing him home, getting him to work, on top of my own work. I loved him, so I thought nothing of it. However, he'd say things in fights that started sticking in my mind, and I started to question why I was even with him. Things got better and he was more excited about moving than I was, and as we got closer to booking out ticket, I got offered a really good job with a family company (my ideal job). He was set on going, wanting to get over there and get back into school, it was hard to talk to him about me staying, and I was stuck deciding if I should pass up the job or not. In the end I decided I need to explore the world a bit more before settling in a job, so I was ready to move. However, he finally started to consider staying and came to realize that he should be with his family and it would be easier to get back into school. we would constantly go back and forth, and he later convinced me he was ready to move so I booked his ticket with mine. I couldn't be happy about it because it followed with more fighting, wondering if things will get better, blaming each other for fights, etc.  things got better but I could never get a surefire answer if he was going. It started to get harder to even get a hold of him. I respected the fact that his grandpa is dying, etc. so I didnt push it. I know he wanted to be with me, but I wasn't going to stay here. 
   These past few weeks we've broken up, got back together, spilled our hearts out, and followed it up with a questionable breakup. We're too young to know what we want to do with our lives, and the only person either of us wants to be with, well we know things are tense but we know how great we can be when we're not worrying about everything. we started to get into an argument tonight, and I finally told him everything as calmly as I could. I think we finally reached an agreement tonight, and I know he's hurting as much as I am. I start to wonder, if we just skipped trying to move if we'd still be going good. The whole situation is fucked.

 Now I'm moving in 28 days, I've never left the state for more than a week, and I've never been to Bellingham before. It's a mixture of fear, excitement, pain of leaving, and desire for more. I'm not sure if I could date again, and at the same time I want someone there to enjoy it all with.

TL;dr: I'm moving in a month, originally with my first real boyfriend, lasting over a year and a half; things got complicated and we're breaking up because he's staying for school and his family. I ended it, and I'm really starting to feel it.

[pic of us a while back](http://i.imgur.com/E6FNmyO.jpg)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;m 21, and have been with a guy for almost a year and a half. Introduced through friends, we hit it off immediately. I mean my names Jesse and his is James! We were a great match, We have countless stories good and bad, and in the long run, I really thought he could be the one. 
 I mean that, and I know he feels the same. I live in Hawaii and the last few months have gotten harder with the idea of moving to the mainland, and we talked about it a lot when we were going good. I mean we&amp;#39;ve worked together in 2 jobs, and we were just fine. We agreed to try for it, so I found a place with my friend so we could move in together and gain experience living together (before we move 2.5 thousand miles away). However we started to have a lot of stressful fights, and he would come over a lot but never officially moved in, so he was paying rent at his friends place but pretty much living with me.  Around then his sister moved here from another island with family issues and to be closer to him, and my brother started to get into trouble with drugs. In addition, his grandpa was diagnosed with lung cancer. 
Having finished school I was starting to realize that I was getting nowhere working here, and we, as well as one of my friends agreed to move to washington at the beginning of may (currently a month away). At the time it seemed like a great idea, but as time went by, we started to fight more, with the added tension of wanting to move together, we started to have terrible fights, yet followed by really passionate times. I started to really feel lost. I invested literally all my time in him because i am the only one with a car and we live 20 miles apart and work is 20 miles from either of us. Picking him up, bringing him home, getting him to work, on top of my own work. I loved him, so I thought nothing of it. However, he&amp;#39;d say things in fights that started sticking in my mind, and I started to question why I was even with him. Things got better and he was more excited about moving than I was, and as we got closer to booking out ticket, I got offered a really good job with a family company (my ideal job).

I'm looking back on the post and I wrote a lot.  It's almost just to get what happened off my chest because I can't stop thinking about it.  Thanks for taking the time to read my story.

Background:

I'm bi.  For the most part I keep to myself about it.  I've never explicitly told anyone.  I've got a friend, we'll call him Timmy.  He's actually my best friend's younger brother and I've come to know him pretty well over the last four years.  I'm 19, Timmy is 17.  Timmy comes to hang out at my place probably about once a month.  We stay up late and play video games or go down to the courts to play basketball and just do generally fun shit.  The problem is.....he's *fucking hot.* He's a 3 sport athlete, lifts everyday, literally looks like an underwear model and frequently walks around with his shirt off.  It's....difficult to control myself to say the least.  Occasionally we'll wrestle around like guys do and I'll ""jokingly"" pants him or slap his ass.  He acts a little grossed out, but then we just keep on fucking around or go right back to playing video games.  

Sometimes when we're playing, he'll sit on the couch with his legs over mine.  I usually don't think much of it.  Some guys don't mind being a little touchy with friends.  It's whatever. 

Here's where it got....different.

This weekend, we're playing video games on the couch and his legs are resting on mine as they occasionally are and I don't know what came over me, but I just started rubbing them.  After I started, he told me his legs hurt from squatting and I offered to stretch him out.  He hesitantly agreed so he lied down on the floor and I started stretching his legs.  I was not....subtle....with the placement of my hands.  I frequently touched closer to his groin than I probably had to.  He didn't say anything though.  I could feel that he shaved his business.  I asked him about it and he confirmed that he did and I told him to let me see.  I pulled down his pants and saw it.  He pretty quickly pulled them back up and was jokingly like, ""Don't look at my dick haha!""

Afterwords we went back to playing games and he said the stretch really made him feel good.  I kept rubbing his back and his legs a little while we took turns playing Fallout.

Night time came around and I pretty much lost my inhibitions.  I put some porn on in the room, but he wasn't interested.  I joked that if he didn't watch with me that he was gonna have to turn around because I was gonna jack off.  He seemed to think that was pretty gross so I didn't do anything.  It was late, we decided to go to sleep.

Needless to say, after the stretch I gave him, seeing his junk, the rubbing and the porn, I was horny as fuck and as soon as I turned the lights off I just asked him straight up.

**""Would you ever let me suck your dick?""**  

He gave a resounding ""NO. That's weird.""

I told him this conversation never happened and I immediately went onto the other room and went to sleep.  I was freaking out.  I was worried I crossed the line.  I was worried that I ruined our friendship.  I was worried he would tell his brother who was my best friend.  I thought best case scenario, shit was just gonna be awkward as fuck the next day.

I woke up early and decided to rub one out to hopefully clear my head.  I thought about him when I did it, but I still hoped that it would sort of put a damper on the whole situation.  When he woke up, we went out and played basketball all day.  It was like nothing happened.

We get back and I sneakily rub another one out in the bathroom to try to stop the urges.  It didn't help at all.  I found him more irresistible than ever.  But I promised myself I wouldn't try anything.  He made it clear how he felt.

We're hanging out in my room and we get around to wrestling a little bit.  Nothing abnormal at first, but then he pins me down in this awkward position with his knees on my shoulders and his crotch literally inches away from my mouth.  I tried to get him off and he was like, ""You like it, you said you wanted to suck it didn't you?""

It was out of character for him to say that.  He never jokes like that.  I struggled and got free.  We went back to playing games.  But this time, I rubbed him a lot.  I was leaning on his shoulder and I had my hands on his thighs and his back inside of his shorts and his shirt.  He didn't stop me.

We went out and ate dinner and when we came back in, he was lying down on his stomach so I offered to massage his back.  He didn't stop me.  I got really into it.  I went all the way from his neck to his feet and back again multiple times.  I could feel how chiseled he was.  Every inch of him was built to perfection.  Occasionally my hands would slip inside his pants and I'd feel his perfect ass.  He would say, ""What are you doing?"" and I'd quickly move them away.  But after about half an hour, I stopped listening to him and felt every inch of him.  Again, he didn't stop me.  I spread his legs and started rubbing the spot between his balls and his booty and it seemed like.....he was hard? I didn't believe it.

I told him to roll over so I could do the front.  He wouldn't.  I had to know.  I lifted up his leg and put my hands under his body and inched my way closer and closer.  He didn't stop me.  Then I felt it with just a finger.  I was the hardest dick I've ever felt in my life.  I couldn't even breathe straight.  I rubbed it a little for a few seconds.  It was pulsing. 

Then he told me to stop.  I did.  We went to sleep.

The next morning, I got a little touchy thinking he liked it, and he didn't seem very receptive to it, sort of pushing my hand away so I didn't push it any further.  We hung out for a few more hours just doing random stuff.  Then he went home.  I asked him if he had fun and he said yeah.  This just happened a few days ago.  I asked him to come over tomorrow and he said maybe.  That's what he always says though, so things seem pretty normal I guess.

The problem is that I don't know what to do now!!! I've literally *never* been more attracted to anyone in my life.  What's the deal with him??? He says gay stuff is weird but he's let me touch him almost more than I've touched anyone in my life.  Should I talk to him about it? I mean, what if he's embarrassed that he had a boner? What if this ruins our friendship? I'm just rambling now.  I really like him and I just don't know how to handle the situation!!!  Help me, give me some advice please.  Anything would be helpful.

**TLDR;** Asked my friend if I could suck his dick, he said no.  I thought it would be awkward/ruin friendship but then he let me touch him all night and even got a boner when I massaged him. I find him extremely attractive. How in the world do I proceed?

Tonight, I log in to Facebook and I see that she just got into a relationship with another friend of ours. This was really unexpected and I got so surprised. I can't stop thinking about it. I know that I can't love her because I'm gay and that if I ever was the guy she was with, I couldn't give her what she would eventually want. But it really hurts, fellas.

I don't know what to do. I asked her over chat if it was real and she said yes. I almost told her that I was jealous of him and I almost just confessed everything to her, but I'm afraid that that will just cause problems and confusion so I just said ""I'm happy for you guys."" I think I love her but I don't think I can put her through being in a relationship with a man who could not end up being with her in the end.

**TL:DR -- Friend that is a girl likes me. I don't do anything about it because I know I couldn't let her be in a relationship that will go nowhere. She now gets boyfriend. I get *very* jealous of him.**

I know that I can&amp;#39;t love her because I&amp;#39;m gay and that if I ever was the guy she was with, I couldn&amp;#39;t give her what she would eventually want. But it really hurts, fellas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know what to do. I asked her over chat if it was real and she said yes. I almost told her that I was jealous of him and I almost just confessed everything to her, but I&amp;#39;m afraid that that will just cause problems and confusion so I just said &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m happy for you guys.&amp;quot; I think I love her but I don&amp;#39;t think I can put her through being in a relationship with a man who could not end up being with her in the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL:DR -- Friend that is a girl likes me. I don&amp;#39;t do anything about it because I know I couldn&amp;#39;t let her be in a relationship that will go nowhere. She now gets boyfriend. I get &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; jealous of him.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

I really need you guys' comments or advice on this. 

So basically my ex moved to Seattle from Boston at the end of Jan for a really good job. I just graduated from college in Dec and started my first real job in Boston in Jan as well. If I can, I really want to move with him. However, the entry job I have in Boston is very prestige(one of the big four accounting firms) and i don't think I can find an equally good one in Seattle for entry level. And giving up on my current job and just move to Seattle is just dangerous as hell. I been to Seattle before and I do like the City. And I'be been in Boston for 5 years and I feel like I need a new environment. 


A little more backgroud about us:I'm 23, he's 28. We have dated for 5 months and been together for 3 months. Things were REALLY great when we were together. I'm sure the good time we had will always be in our memories. We NEVER fight either and really care about each other. Plus we were each other's first bf. The month before he left we actually became the closest. Although we almost cried every time, we had so much good time together. The night before he left, he cried like crazy. I was holding him, and he kept telling me ""I'm so sorry. Sorry. This is the toughest decision in my life."" Before he left, we never talked about break up, long distance, no anything. Basically he just left.


I was miserable the first week he left. Felt like a part of my heart is lost. It was so painful that I unfollow him on fb. Yet I manually check his personal page ALL THE TIME. The good thing is he doesn't post that often. It's good because I know it will hurt to see his new friends, new life and stuff. One day I couldn't help but call him and we were really honest with each other on the phone. He said I am the best and he wants me to be one of his best friends. And we both agreed we will be happy if either of us find a new bf. I did not ask for a long distance, but he told me he could not do long distance. He also told me that even tho he's 3000 miles away, he will always be there for me.


Sometimes I wish he can just don't care about me and move on because I know I will always be the one who want to get back together if I know he still has feelings for me. It's been two months since he's gone and our communication is ongoing.Not like long conversations, but in a daily basis. We mainly texted through whatsapp. One day or two I was really upset because of long hours at work and he offered to FaceTime me to make me feel better. 

I was planning to stay with my job in Boston for at least a year, but i found out I hate accounting and want a career change. So then the option of finding a new job in Seattle and getting back to him came into my mind. And it will always bother me because quitting the current job is still risky and hard. And I know that the longer I stay in Boston, the more hopeless that he will keep having feelings for me and wanting me back.


Somehow I booked a ticket a month ago to Seattle. I'm leaving in two weeks. When i go, I want to have fun and feel if I really like Seattle. I'm gonna stay at my ex's place as well. I know he's excited too because recently he initiates the texting every time. On a Sat night he even texted me "" I know you are prob asleep, but I want you to know that I'm excited to see you soon.""


Oh man. I just can't let him go. Meanwhile, I know it's hard to move there really soon. The reality is tough. Also, if I'm not moving there soon, our feelings will fade away. I hate distance and time. It can kill everything.

At least these past two months I can't be truly happy and hoping that we can get back together because I don't mind to make the sacrificed to move to Seattle. However, it's not like guarantee that we will still be together even after I move there. 


So complicated.

I am a current high school senior who just recently got into his dream college (fuck yes!!). I've been out to my closest friends for over a year now. All of their families know and support me. 

All my life I've had a decent, but kind of strange relationship with my parents. We've never really been able to relate simply because we don't have the same interests. I guess I'll say that they really aren't as intelligent as I am, and sometimes it's hard to talk to them about anything in general because of it. They know I am a very liberal person and I realize that they aren't as much, my dad especially. My dad can get kind of aggressive about this occasionally, but usually I don't bring stuff up about it, he or something else is the instigator. (For example, I always try to avoid watching the news with them, or watching TV in general because of all of the gay issues, or even real world politics. (my dad's explanation for the drop in gas prices a while back was because ""they know Obama is gonna get out of office soon"") And I must say, represtation of gay people in the media is good, but not when you have your foot out of the closet. haha. I live in a super small town in a rural area and that is where they are from as well- so they never really experienced the world. I'm pretty sure they don't really know that all gay men aren't complete flamers, or the same type of gays seen in media. My dad can be very aggressive and sometimes has violent psychotic fits (think Bradley Cooper in Silver Linings Playbook). He's never really been physically abusive to anyone in my family during these; just imagine table flipping, throwing things, etc. And when these episodes happen, there is no way to reason with him. 

They are really proud of me though, especially for getting into my dream school (mostly because they never went to college themselves and they know the opportunities that I have now) and they do support me through almost anything. I just know that I'll need to come out to them sometime in the process, and it hurts like hell knowing that they might disown me, stop supporting me through college, etc. (I know my grandma, my dad's mom, is a therapist or something and I overhead my dad once mention how she ""fixes gay people."" I don't know how true this is or how specialized she is in this. I just know that she is a therapist at a Christian outreach center. Same goes with my dad's close uncle as well, although he's across the country. My grandparents (dad's parents) are really supportive as well, and I don't know what kind of awkward outcome will happen once I come out.) 

I also should add that the college- a large, Midwestern public University- is extremely gay friendly. I obviously plan on  being open about sexuality once I get to college and hope to score a qt.314 boyfriend sometime as soon as possible  (let's just say that living in a small town definitely has its lack of gay, and I have never even tried dating here). 

The question is: when do i come out to my parents?  Ideally I'd like them to just know and be fine with it, obviously, but I know this won't be the case. I don't want to cause any drama, and hate knowing that I've tried being the perfect son all my life only for them to lose their proudness for me after finding out my sexuality. 

-Do I wait until I'm copletely out of college and off on my own? 
-Do I tell them once I get a boyfriend? 
-Should I tell them before heading to college? 

And what type of setting do you suggest I do it in once the time comes? Over the phone? face to face in my current town? or maybe over dinner once they're visiting me next year? (I know I could find temporary support from the people in a restaurant in this very liberal college town) 

I feel like once it happens, it will be a huge deal at first (probably a ravenous psychotic episodes of anger from my dad), but then my dad will come around after a while and accept me. My mother and I are both very passive peope, and I know she loves me unconditionally. Without my father in the picture, I know I'd already be out to her. 

Again, I hate not being completely true to them, but i don't want to cause drama. I'm so used to being a perfect son, and like I said before: it sucks being the way I am, but being ""imperfect"" in their eyes. I really haven't done anything wrong.

I am a high school junior in a relatively left wing part of Georgia. A few weeks ago I started dating a senior from another school. He's cute and charming and sweet and he likes me as much as I like him. There's a disconnect because he is largely in the closet and I am all of the way out.

The only real negative we could come up with aside from HIV is the pressure from society. 

I thought I'd open this topic up and see what thoughts you guys might have.

I adore pretty much everything about men, especially sex, but it is very very nice to be partnered with someone who understands you and thinks like you do.

We’ve been together for about four months, which isn’t long but it’s long enough that I really know I want more. The problem is, we struggle to be able to make a lot of time to see each other. He’s in the service, active duty, and I’m a full time dad. Between his job and my family responsibilities, it’s hard to carve out time for a dinner date, let alone an overnight visit. 

Over the past month or so, he’s had to repeatedly cancel dates with me. Once was for something family related, the rest were because of being unexpectedly called in to work on days or evenings he was supposed to have had off. We have generally texted and or called each other every day, so its not like I'm getting ghosted. I have no reason to doubt the legitimacy of the cancellations.

It happened again this Saturday I was frustrated and though I have usually been incredibly understanding, I went ahead and told him that this was getting harder and harder for me to deal with, because its been literally a month since we’ve seen each other and two since we’ve been intimate. I tried to not take it out on him, but I did say that we both needed to do a better job of finding ways to be more connected, if we weren’t going to be able to rely on regular dates and time together.

He apologized, but went on to say that he loves me, and wants nothing more than to be with me, but that his job is eating him alive, and he’s been fighting hard with depression and PTSD, and he needs some time to sort things out and deal with his depression. “My head is not in the right place,” he said. “There are days that I don’t want to be touched. I have horrible nightmares. You are amazing and I can’t keep hurting you. I made a mistake thinking I was ready.”

I was surprised and feeling more than a little hurt. I knew about his struggles already, and thought I was being supportive and understanding and caring. I didn’t think I was making things worse for him. This was literally the first time I had expressed even a little frustration, and even as I did I was clear that I wasn’t mad at him, just frustrated that things keep coming up. I asked him to help me figure out ways we can be connected despite his erratic schedule. 

Ultimately he said, a couple of times, that he doesn’t want to end our relationship, that he just wants some time to himself, to think and work with his therapist and try to get his head into the right place. 

I know many of you will say, “run and don’t look back, he’s too damaged.” And maybe that’s the right advice, but in so many ways he’s a perfect fit for me. Everything had been going very well, and besides the frustrations with struggling  to carve time out of our schedules to be together I really was starting to have visions of a real future. 

What do you guys think? Hang around? Make peace with this being the end? Wait for him? Date around but be open to figuring things out eventually? I need your help, bros.

Up until now I've exclusively had sex with girls (and I'm not unattracted to them) and I fooled around with a guy last November (we basically just went down on each other). However, I've been watching gay porn since I was in high school, and as a senior I've come to realize that I don't want to live with regrets in college and not live to the fullest. 


On Saturday I went to a party at a friends apartment, where I knew many people who had transferred from a branch campus, like me, and others I knew from a large organization (like thousands of students) that I am involved in. I was playing some drinking games with friends when I recognized a really hot, blonde, gay guy from a different group in our organization who I'll refer to as John. Me and John have a few mutual friends so I went up to him and started talking to him, he was being really friendly and we took a couple selfies together. It even turns out that he lives one town over from me at home. As my friends were about to leave I took a chance and asked him for his phone number, and immediately his demeanor shifted and he started giving me fuck-eyes. I went back to my friends place and kept texting him. He hadn't initially thought that I was gay but we kept flirting back and forth and finally he told me that he was home alone and wanted to hookup with me. I pretty much ran out of my friends place, brushed my teeth at my place and went over to his apartment. 


John let me in the door and we pretty much grabbed each other right away and started making out. He went down on me and then he wanted me to fuck him, he was really horny, and he gave me a condom and lube to get it going. I tried out a couple different positions, doggy style, lifting his legs over my shoulders, pinning him down with my arm around his neck while I rammed him on the bed. The more I dominated the more he would talk dirty and get into it. The only issue I was having was that I kept slipping out, probably because of the beer I drank. I fucked him hard so when he finally came he was shaking and I sucked him while he finished in my mouth. It was definitely the hottest sex I've ever had. We cleaned up and recovered and talked and cuddled afterward, but he was starting to fall asleep and his roommate was about to come back home, and since only I've only told 4 people that I'm into guys, I was afraid she would tell other people that I slept with him. I honestly wish that I'd taken a chance and stayed over, but I offered to have him come over to my single bedroom later this week, and he said the sex was fantastic and he wants to do it again. I'm really into John, and I want to make everything awesome and sexy if he wants to keep this going. 


So can you bros help me by giving a new guy some advice? I only have ""her pleasure"" condoms, I don't know what lube I need to get and where I would get it. I don't even have sexy underwear, and I feel a little down because everything he was wearing radiated sex appeal and I was wearing a button up. I want to try out some new positions but I'm not sure what ones are fun. I'm nervous too because of some medical issues I'm really thin, kinda scrawny but tall, and he is thin but curvy, and I want to be able to throw him around in bed. I'm concerned that if I have him over at my place, one of my neighbors will hear us through the walls or doors, and since I hang out with them often, and they all think I'm straight, I don't want them to find out. I definitely don't want John to feel like I'm sneaking him in and out of my place, that's just rude and a turn off. Can you guys explain some essentials to me? I just had the best sexual experience of my life, and I don't want this to fizzle out. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a 21 year old college student at large public university. Up until now I&amp;#39;ve exclusively had sex with girls (and I&amp;#39;m not unattracted to them) and I fooled around with a guy last November (we basically just went down on each other). However, I&amp;#39;ve been watching gay porn since I was in high school, and as a senior I&amp;#39;ve come to realize that I don&amp;#39;t want to live with regrets in college and not live to the fullest. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Saturday I went to a party at a friends apartment, where I knew many people who had transferred from a branch campus, like me, and others I knew from a large organization (like thousands of students) that I am involved in. I was playing some drinking games with friends when I recognized a really hot, blonde, gay guy from a different group in our organization who I&amp;#39;ll refer to as John. Me and John have a few mutual friends so I went up to him and started talking to him, he was being really friendly and we took a couple selfies together. It even turns out that he lives one town over from me at home. As my friends were about to leave I took a chance and asked him for his phone number, and immediately his demeanor shifted and he started giving me fuck-eyes. I went back to my friends place and kept texting him. He hadn&amp;#39;t initially thought that I was gay but we kept flirting back and forth and finally he told me that he was home alone and wanted to hookup with me. I pretty much ran out of my friends place, brushed my teeth at my place and went over to his apartment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John let me in the door and we pretty much grabbed each other right away and started making out. He went down on me and then he wanted me to fuck him, he was really horny, and he gave me a condom and lube to get it going. I tried out a couple different positions, doggy style, lifting his legs over my shoulders, pinning him down with my arm around his neck while I rammed him on the bed. The more I dominated the more he would talk dirty and get into it. The only issue I was having was that I kept slipping out, probably because of the beer I drank. I fucked him hard so when he finally came he was shaking and I sucked him while he finished in my mouth. It was definitely the hottest sex I&amp;#39;ve ever had. We cleaned up and recovered and talked and cuddled afterward, but he was starting to fall asleep and his roommate was about to come back home, and since only I&amp;#39;ve only told 4 people that I&amp;#39;m into guys, I was afraid she would tell other people that I slept with him.

Ex and I dated for over a year and a half (lived together for over half of that).  He broke up with me for someone else in October 2014 after I moved to a different state for work.  We reconciled briefly (~3 weeks) back in early January, and it ended because he cheated on me twice with the guy he initially left me for, and they're still together.

I am having a really, really hard time getting over him.  Saying ""he's the best I'll ever have, nobody is like him"" is painfully trite, but it's a feeling I just can't shake.  I've never met someone who is as funny, attractive, intelligent, well dressed, well read, charming, and fit as him.  I don't connect with guys very easily, but with him it was effortless from day one.  The sex was amazing.  We spent just as much time in the gym together as we did playing video games.  If I had to make a list of things I wanted in a partner, he would check all of them.  He was, by far, the most dynamic person I’ve ever met in my life.

But there was bad.  Like I said, he cheated on me most recently back in January with that same guy.  He also cheated on me (with the same guy) a few days before we broke up, and he made out with another guy last summer.  He’s lied before, and he has a tendency to be manipulative when he wants to be.  With that said, I was no angel in our relationship, and there was deception on both of our parts.

Despite everything, the connection we had was very deep and intense, and I’m still reeling from the breakup.  I have never been a very confident guy by any stretch, but I feel like what little self-worth I had has been obliterated by being dumped for someone else, not once but twice.  From day one, I felt like this guy was so far out of my league and I had no idea why he was interested in me.  And then after leaving me for someone else...I feel utterly worthless.  I can’t shake the feeling that I’ll never find someone like him who is also attracted to me.  I’m so afraid of spending the rest of my life settling, which is something I never felt like I was doing when I was with him.  I’ve gone on dates / hooked up with other guys, but every time I’m left feeling worse because it pales in comparison to him.  What’s even worse is that my ex moved to the city where we had planned to start a life, and now this guy is moving to that city to move in with him / start that life.  And I’m just left here struggling to pick up the pieces and make it through the days.

I know there’s no magical combination of words to make this pain go away.  I know “time heals all wounds” and the traditional go-to’s when it comes to a break-up.  I guess I just wanted some unbiased perspective and real talk.  My friends have surely grown tired of hearing me wax poetic about my past relationship and what I should have done differently.  Is this normal?  Or am I just setting myself up for a lifetime of disappointment?
