The other day, we went on a date and had a blast! We spent the day tabogganing, swimming, walking on the beach, wine tasting and then finished off with a bonfire. He introduced me to his family as well that day. During the bonfire, we walked off in the dark and sat by the shore for some alone time and he was telling me a lot of reasons why he liked me.

At this time, we had over 20 glasses of wine so I thought that maybe he was drunk. The next morning though, he pulled me aside and said that he meant what he said last night, that he does love me but can't commit to a relationship yet because of work. 

I'm so confused. I know he's a genuine person because for the past few months, he's always been the same nice, kind and caring person. I really like him, and he says he loves me, but we're not in a relationship? Is this gonna work between us?

There's this guy I have some feelings for and my intuition told me was bottom but I never confirmed it until recently when we openly discussed it.

I also never told him I had any feelings for him in case he really was a bottom, I get rejected, etc.

I'm not 100% bottom if that makes any sense. I think I'm like 80/20; I'm willing to be versatile.

But when we openly discussed our preferences, he mentioned something about knowing that I was ""somewhat"" a bottom and that's why he told me that we're just friends.

He has said he's 100% bottom has tried top and didn't like it.

So I'm kinda disappointed because I was hoping to take it further. I also hinted that we should stop being friends, even more so with our preferences as I'm concerned my feelings for him won't go away so easily.

And he's sad that I'm even considering that; he wouldn't stop me from moving on but that he'll always be here if I need him.

I read that sexual preferences shouldn't define a relationship and what happens outside the bedroom.

He's clearly not interested at all in compromising so I guess I'll stop considering compromising on my end too and just move on.

I know he isn't just saying this because he just wants sex otherwise he would've MIA-ed long ago. The friends part *is* genuine; even after finding out, he still hangs out with me a lot.

I currently live in San Jose, CA but I have a couple of job offers on the table, which one of the two I should definitely take, because both are great for my career and a *lot* more money than what I currently make. One of them, however, is in Seattle. One of the things that have always been a challenge to me is meeting brand new people.

One of the challenges I have, besides being a little introverted at first, is that I don't dig the gay hookup app culture (no offense if you're into it, I just personally can't operate that way) and I'm not a fan of bars in general. I do like sports, I lift weights, and I'm a bit of geek (I play a lot of PC games like League of Legends, tabletop games), and I love conversation and intellectual stuff. It seems hard to find people who don't want an environment that's focused on hookups, which isn't how I operate. I'm one of those gay guys that like to know someone before I get there.

Anyway, this is a long winded way of asking, what sorts of things might you recommend outside of the bar/hookup scene in Seattle and is it as hard to meet new people as I hear it is up there (i.e. the ""Seattle Freeze"" I keep hearing about)? My biggest fear is that I'll take the Seattle job and just end up feeling rather alone and isolated. Can you guys help?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey GayBros,&lt;/p&gt;

So I was at home, relaxing before work and I get a knock on my door. My next door neighbor was there and asked me if I had a set of pliers that he could borrow. No problem, I loaned him the pliers and he said he'd be back in 10 minutes. So he came back and asked if I'd help him change out his leaky shower head. Once again, no problem, I went over there with him and showed him how to remove the shower head. 
A little description of my neighbor, he's about mid forties, Hispanic and speaks minimal English.
Now this is where things get weird. So as I'm removing the shower head, he asked me if I knew any places around here to buy porn. I almost suggested just using the Internet but instead just told him I didn't know of any place. I thought that was strange but then again maybe there was just some kind of cultural confusion and he just didn't realize how strange a question that would be. So I take the shower head off and asked him if he had the replacement and I'd just put it on for him. While he's looking through his cabinet for the new shower head he proceed to tell me, ""Sorry, my boobs get in the way (he's a heavier set guy)."" I just said no problem (once again weird) as he continued to look for the shower head. He then tells me how his friends always say that he has the breasts of a women and how great they feel. After that I'm starting to get really uncomfortable and try to say something about going to work soon but he interrupts me by asking if I knew anyone that would like to play with his boobs. I said no. At this point he says to me, well I have fifty dollars right now that I'll give to you if you'll just sit in my chair and let me suck you off while you play with my breasts. I just said no and started heading towards the door to leave and he stops in front of the door and tell me that he won't tell anyone and proceeds to lift up his shirt and show me that he is wearing a bra and try's to get me to feel his boobs. I just told him no (once again) and left. Keep in mind, I had absolutely no intentions of doing anything with this guy except to help him change his shower head. I don't know exactly what to do at this point. I'm a little shocked and just feel violated. He insisted that I not tell anyone and now I'm just nervous to even look over towards his house. I don't know, he always seemed harmless but after this incident I just don't know. I haven't told my roommates yet what has happened, but has anyone else been in a situation like this?

I've had a series of first dates which usually result in silence following, despite my feeling that the date goes well (there's lots of conversation, joking, laughing, etc).  

I'm also a little overweight (220b), and terribly shy until you get to know me.  As a result, attracting guys is just short of impossible and I've all but given up.

So, now I'm in a situation where I'm talking regularly to two different guys.  I want to move forward with both of them until I know that one of them will work and I'm fine with that.  With both guys, we text nearly every day.  One of them lives an hour away, and we were going to meet until weather got in our way.

The second guy is a little more interesting.  We've met for lunch once.  He's adorable, sweet, funny, and I'm just head over heels for him.  I've never fallen for anyone like this, it's a strange and incredible feeling.  He still texts me after our lunch which is a first, so I'm taking that as a good sign.  I get almost giddy when I get his texts, which is also a new experience for me, and feelings that I was starting to wonder if I was even capable of.  We'd been trying to find a time to meet again, and I think that after a month, we may be able to meet next week.  

So here's where the self doubt and nervousness kicks in.  I really do not want to fuck this up.  Whatever it is that I'm doing on dates, I need to make sure I don't do it (which is odd, because I have NO idea what causes this odd fadeaway).  He's way more attractive than I am, and I wonder why he would be attracted to me.  I have no idea how to date - what to talk about, how to pay, what to do after dinner, how to make sure I get a second date without being overeager, how to flirt and express my interest, and how to conclude (last time was awkward handshakes, not sure if I should have pushed for a hug, kiss, whatever).

I'm trying not to get my hopes up, because I don't want to be disappointed (but I also don't want to view rejection as inevitable).  I'd also like to know that dating and relationships is something that I'm actually capable of doing.
