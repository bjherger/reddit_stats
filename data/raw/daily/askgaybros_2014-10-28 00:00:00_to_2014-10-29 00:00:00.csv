http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/2jjwxq/he_likes_me_but_i_feel_he_is_out_of_my_league/

So I was already aware that the guy I'm seeing hadn't come out to all of his friends though I had never really considered how that would affect us being together. The date was going really well and we started kissing so I asked him if he wanted to go back to his place and he said yes. On the way there he warned me that if anyone was home then either we would have to sneak in and out or we wouldn't be able to go in at all. We got to his house and he told me to ""Wait here whilst I see if anyone is home"" this got to me and luckily there was someone home and we couldn't go in as I don't think I was really up for sex at that point. He had explained to me why he hadn't told his roommates and I brushed it off and we went to get dinner. After dinner we went to his friends house before we got there he told me that ""only one of my friends knows about us so don't bring it up"" upon asking him who I should say I am when asked he said ""just a friend"" this really got to me if I can't be his boyfriend/date/whatever around his friends then how can we possibly take things further. This is only our second date so I don't expect him to refer to me as his boyfriend but it doesn't look like this is an issue that is going to be resolved anytime soon and if we are going to take this seriously (which he has expressed he wants to) then he needs to be more open about his sexuality as I don't like being someone's dirty secret. He is a really nice guy and we get along superbly but I have never been able to get into a relationship with someone who has one foot out the closet. 

So I am left with the question; Do it tell him that he needs to be more open about his sexuality if he wants to keep seeing me or do I simply wait it out and hope he does it in his own time?

I would feel like an asshole if I gave him an ultimatum as I know how hard it is to come out but I don't see any other way round it.

Although I've never posted on reddit before, I have been reading all the lgbt subreddits for a while. 

I just wanted your opinions on my mindset. I know I can't be the only one with this view and I was hoping you guys could give me another angle on it; some food for thought for me. Perhaps I'm not thinking the situation through due to being extremely stubborn. 

Here it is:

I don't think I should have to come out. Straight people don't need to tell people they're straight. Why should I have to tell people I'm gay?

In my mind when I picture myself finding a guy who I get along really well with, I want to just be able to bring him to family functions etc without questions asked. That's in my ideal world. 

I'm stubborn in thinking that what I do with my love life is my business only. No one else in my family should even think about it or care. 

My Dad said once in a passing comment when a news report for the Australian Mardi Gras came on that ""All faggots should be taken out into the fields and shot"". This was years and years ago but for some reason I still remember it. More recently he told me that he loves me...unless I end up "" getting a boyfriend named Trixie"". I legitimately don't think he truely means these things but I can't understand why he would say them. Because it's a masculine viewpoint? I really don't know. 

I know both of my parents know I'm gay even though I haven't told them. I'm not overly flamboyant but my ""sassy wit"" (not my words) seem to make it obvious as people get to know me. Dad in particular might make small passing gestures like commenting on good looking women on the TV and leaving it open ended for me to agree with him. Stuff like that. 

I guess what I'm getting at is that the fact I subconsciously don't think that I should need to come is like...a manifestation of spite towards him for knowing about me but still trying to make me uncomfortable. I dunno. I know this post is a bit all over the place but it's late here. :P

tl;dr: I'm too stubborn to think that I need to come out because straight people don't need to. Do you agree/disagree and why? 

Deeply insightful replies are more than welcome! I think I just need to have a discussion about it.

Using a dud account as I love Reddit and use my regular account heaps.

Bi 24 year old guy. First time fooling around with a guy today and for the most part went great and am happy with the result. I only have a few questions due to 'it was great but what if...'-related paranoia:

- Let him suck on my balls as he wanted to and didn't seem to me to be at any risk of getting anything from him by letting him do that, was firm about not getting a blowjob off him though as he was a stranger. As he was sucking my balls he licked pretty close to my asshole so I'd almost consider it getting rimmed. Only twice of three times before I said I didn't want him to do that: am I at risk of anything? Am worried that by licking my asshole twice or three times he might have put me at risk of something?

- Sex with a condom and i stoked his asshole a few times with my fingers but never put them inside. Had a hard time staying hard for long periods of time as it was my first time so after being inside of him for a bit I stopped, pulled the condom off, jerked myself off a bit and then he jerked me off to completion: Should I worry about jerking myself off after touching his asshole? Is there any risk of transmission from that? That something stayed on my hands or on his hands and then while we were jerking each other off could have made its way into me?

Besides these two concerns I had a great first time, everything a guy could ask for. Guy (even though he was a random who I met from Grindr) was incredibly patient with me, friendly, and had an amazing body which also made for a great first time. Getting jerked off by a tanned, muscular dude and being able to just grab any muscle on his body while he pleasured me was such a joy and I kept holding off coming so I could keep enjoying it.

Thanks so much guys!

I was raised believing being gay was a choice, it was wrong and sinful.  I believed this up until I was about 16 or 17.  I started to realize I was gay around this time, but I was in denial for a very long time, I didn't want to be true.  I think this lead to why I am so socially recessed now, I was so afraid of myself, I hated myself, I really just tore my personality apart because I wanted to be ""normal"" and fit in, I felt like I had an identity crisis.

I have two ex girlfriends.  The second was the first person I came out to, she was really understanding (Shes actually pan-sexual).  Fast forward to college and I tell my first girlfriend in a novel of a facebook message, she was really understanding as well, I was so happy.  Our romantic relationship in high school just fell apart *for obvious reasons*, but we had still been friends.

Now here's where I get really depressed, when I was in denial, I wanted nothing more than a to be with her.  We are just so happy together, we know each other so well, and were always laughing and smiling when around each other.  To be honest, she makes me wish I was straight.  We've talked about this before lightly, she says she wishes I was straight, but she thinks that's selfish of her.  She makes me so happy, I still have love letters and drawings she made for me from high school I treasure so much but can't bring myself to look at.

I'm 100% certain I'm gay, no sexual attraction from girls whatsoever,  just, this makes me feel so emotional, like my hands are trembling a little from recalling and typing all this.

I am kind of out about being gay, I'll tell people if it comes up in convo (ex: friend ""That girls hot."" me ""I'm gay, but yeah shes pretty"").  My personality is pretty straight appearing from how I was raised which makes it difficult since people assume I'm straight.  Which brings me to my next point, *I'm more terrified that anything else in my life about telling my parents*.  I feel they would still love me, but I'm scared about how else they still react.  Like, my mom starts to complain if *Modern Family* is on TV because of the gay couple, I've heard her say things like ""Ugh, they should all just get girlfriends"" and ""All the designers on TV are gay because they can't have a loving family and can devote all their time to their job""

I was also visiting one of my closest friends recently, he's the first of my close-guy-straight friends I've come out to so it was a real milestone, he was really understanding too, ""Yeah, but you're still [muffinanomaly], everyone should know that.""  I was so relieved with the conversation I had, my jaw was chattering from all the released tension and anxiety I had before I said it.

**long tl;dr** But for whatever reason on the train ride home after visiting these friends, I felt really depressed.  That weekend I visited my first ex GF and we had a lot of fun.  I stayed at the male friends house and we mostly played video games and I came out to him.  I should have felt really happy and accomplished, I don't know why I felt so depressed.  Maybe I was just finally accepting it, that the girl I imagined I would spend my life with and we mutually wish we could will just be a close friend(well, probably still lifelong friends, but this still keeps me up at night til ungodly hours thinking about it), my gaydar sucks, my personality is so straight appearing, and my closest Tinder matches are really far away so dating is hard for me, and one day I'm going to have to tell my parents which I don't think anything else in my life has scared me more.  It just sucks.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t even know where to start, I&amp;#39;ll try to keep it short and simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was also visiting one of my closest friends recently, he&amp;#39;s the first of my close-guy-straight friends I&amp;#39;ve come out to so it was a real milestone, he was really understanding too, &amp;quot;Yeah, but you&amp;#39;re still [muffinanomaly], everyone should know that.&amp;quot;  I was so relieved with the conversation I had, my jaw was chattering from all the released tension and anxiety I had before I said it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;long tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt; But for whatever reason on the train ride home after visiting these friends, I felt really depressed.  That weekend I visited my first ex GF and we had a lot of fun.  I stayed at the male friends house and we mostly played video games and I came out to him.  I should have felt really happy and accomplished, I don&amp;#39;t know why I felt so depressed.  Maybe I was just finally accepting it, that the girl I imagined I would spend my life with and we mutually wish we could will just be a close friend(well, probably still lifelong friends, but this still keeps me up at night til ungodly hours thinking about it), my gaydar sucks, my personality is so straight appearing, and my closest Tinder matches are really far away so dating is hard for me, and one day I&amp;#39;m going to have to tell my parents which I don&amp;#39;t think anything else in my life has scared me more.  It just sucks.&lt;/p&gt;

The title pretty much summarizes it all but here is some background info:

I am 23 and I am out to my closest friends not from university. Recently I have been hanging out with a classmate of mine, mostly going to the gym together, enough to get a big time crush on him.
Normally I'm used to these straight-crush situations and I'm pretty good at letting them pass by but this time I am kind of convinced he might be gay as well and that he actually likes me back. 
Here is where I am confused, could it be that my ""gaydar"" is driving me in the wrong direction just cause I've been in a dry spill for way too long and wish badly for something like this to happen and like this guy quite a lot? 
Also he was together with a common female friend of ours a couple of years ago and apparently (I'm not 100%sure about this) he broke it off with her because they were having too much sex. Would a straight guy do this? -I know these are huge generalizations-
Since this girl he hasn't had any other romantic flicks, or at least that I am aware of and he's a hot and intelligent guy.

Sorry for bothering you guys with this long story, it's just I'm not sure what to do...
I was planning on trying to ask him in a subtle/discrete way but haven't figured out how yet. I could also ask his ex (which actually is a pretty good friend if mine but I don't want to expose myself to her because she had a pretty strong crush on me and we made out a couple of times and I just don't want to complicate things right now since we're at such a good place with our friendship)

Any advice?

I was a swimmer for 12 years, so the hyper masculine culture wasn't as apparent as we helped each other shave our legs haha. Not to say there weren't homoerotic moments such as the aforementioned, towel whipping and running around the locker room in just a speedo. BUT, on my team at least, there was no sexual hazing whatsoever. If my memory serves me right the guys were too scared ""to look gay"" to begin with - maybe because we were swimmers and faced that stigma already... 

So if any bros who played the stereotypical masculine sports could shed some light on hazing using sexual acts that would be great. I understand the process of asserting dominance, but why would the senior player want to start penetration of any sort to begin with? Why not a punch in the face instead?

Not that I'm dying to be in a relationship or anything, but I've recently come to the realization of why I have only been interested in straight guys:

*I don't know what a gay relationship looks like.*

This is one of the hard parts of being a young gay man in the 21st century. I've had nothing but acceptance and understanding from my straight peers since coming out, and I've never truly felt the need to find my own community of queer people. But after falling for yet another straight friend[this instance being the the most personal and painful one of all], I've realized that I can't keep doing this to myself. I love my straight friends, and I want to keep them in my life, but **now** is the time when I need to find a community where I can finally feel *normal*. Because no matter how accepting the 'straight world' might be of us, it is still very hard to accept that it is okay and normal to be gay when you're completely surrounded by straight couples. This is my internalized homophobia that I never even realized was there, because I have actively chosen to live in the 'straight world'.

So, the reason I'm un-subbing from Ask Gay Bros is because I've been using it for the past year to read all the stories about falling for straight friends. It's weirdly fed my fantasy and my delusion. Its a great community, and a great tool for talking about our issues, but I'm done talking about my issues. It's time to actually work on them.

Maybe I'll come back after some time has passed, and I've been able to clear my head. I strongly urge anyone who is dealing with their feelings for a straight friend to take the space needed to reboot, and to try and find a physical community of like-minded individuals. It's fricking scary, I know, but sometimes you just gotta throw yourself into the deep end. That's what I'm going to try and do.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m 25, I&amp;#39;ve been out of the closet for ten years now and have never been in a proper relationship.&lt;br/&gt;
