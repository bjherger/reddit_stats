It means I look down on bottoming, viewing it as feminine and stereotypically gay. 

I don't know if I am inherently bottom, top or vers. I would like to think I'm versatile since I fantasise both (topping younger guys and bottoming for older guys) but I don't have enough experience to tell yet. I don't like the physical feeling of bottoming and as for topping I haven't tried it. 

I don't want to bring these insecurities into   a potential relationship. And I don't want to have random hookups to find out what I like. 

I like the idea of being a relationship with a younger guy (I'm 23) but it's probably my bottom shame pushing me into that idea. How do you deal with this?

A few weeks ago me and my boyfriend of 3.5 years started to properly explore BDSM after a good few years of dabbling. It went extremely well and I opened myself up to him in ways I never thought I could; I felt I could trust him with my life and we connected on a deeper level than I ever thought possible, so at that point I'd never felt closer to him. He discovered a lot about himself and was just as into it as I was.

So about 3 days into relentlessly teasing and egging each other on, he comes out with ""can we not talk about sex all the time?"". I, thinking he was as into it as me, was quite surprised at that and immediately began to feel kind of insecure since I'd essentially bared my soul to him in the preceding days. We talked and he assured me he loved me and what we had been exploring together, he just couldn't do it 24/7 (which I guess is a miscommunication on my part, as neither could I). 

Since then however... I just haven't wanted to get close to him. He'll reach over in bed for a cuddle and I tighten up and would rather be anywhere else. Our living situation is quite stressful (both of us are in the final stages of college) and due to having a roommate we never get to spend time alone together except for in bed. I think not being able to communicate with each other properly as a couple is starting to affect us.

On the whole though, I have no idea what's wrong. I know 100% that things don't feel right on my end (he's perfectly content besides being stressed about his work) and I have no idea what or how to make things better. I still love him, I'm not angry at him or anything, I'm just ultra wary of being close to him in any way.

So since the age of 14 I found myself enjoying and often watching a lot of gay porn as well as straight porn, I'm now 23 and I still do watch both types, except now I've had sex with both men and women. I enjoy sex with both but I still find that I have no romantic or emotional attraction to any man I meet at all, I have never fallen for or even had a small attraction a man on any level. I have always fallen in love with women and only find myself checking out girls when on nights out etc.

This being said I enjoy gay sex, i enjoy giving and receiving both oral and anal sex, the thought of a penis turns me on as does the thought of vagina. But still I never have thoughts of romanticism with men, I don't enjoy kissing them (not because of deep seated social reasons) I find a man kiss un fulfilling and unexciting but the complete opposite with girls.

What does this make me? Do I just enjoy sex? sorry if I can't explain this properly I've never spoken to anyone about this before and I'm not sure how I should think about it. My current thoughts are that I'm straight but just enjoy sex. Again to make clear I have no and have never had (and am confident I never will) emotional feelings towards men, it is purely a sex thing.

TLDR: Fancy women, have sex with men and women, do not fancy men at all.

I guess I&amp;#39;m just wondering if there&amp;#39;s anything more I can tell guys that I hook up with/have a FWB arrangement with that will make them realize that if they want something long term/committed relationship, that I can&amp;#39;t deliver that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Hookups and FWBs want more than that, even though I&amp;#39;m up front from the beginning that that&amp;#39;s not what I&amp;#39;m looking for. How do I get my point across?&lt;/p&gt;

Denver is always brought up by just about everyone these days and I was wondering what everyone's thoughts are. I guess some basic questions...

1) What is the gay scene in Denver in terms of age, style, attitude etc...? Im coming from DC and RVA (Richmond, VA). DC has a late-20s early-30s crowd, stuck up usually, not very gaybro. RVA is definitely college and mid 20s professionals but the gay scene is almost non-existent (okay not that bad) and not very transient, doing the same frat boy over and over is cool at first.... on top of that its not the sexiest population. 

2) What are the best neighborhoods for a 24 y/o low income gaybro? DC is worse than NYC, and RVA's prices let you work as Jimmy Johns bike boy and still be ballin. 

3) What is the job scene like? Both hourly and career wise. I focus in international/policy/government while my roomie is fashion/marketing. NYC and DC are obvious no brainers for us but the struggle is too real at the moment, wed rather wait til were in our late 20s, living in the epicenter of our fields at 24 isnt a priority (mistake?). 

Were considering Oakland, Seattle, Portland, Boston, amongst others but figured I'd ask about Denver since I see it posted more on here. 

thanks guys!

I'm kind of short in the gaybro friend department, and the guy I'd normally turn to is the one at the center of all this. Just looking for some clarity and some opinions on where to go from here.

My best friend of two years, who I'll call Nick, and I lived together with two other friends in the same apartment this past summer. We're all juniors in college (20-21 years old). I'm openly gay, everyone else in the apartment was supposedly straight. Nick had been dating the same girl for about three years (high school sweetheart) at the beginning of summer. They had a pretty nasty breakup, and he took it hard. 

The summer started off with me doing my best bro duties and trying to keep his mind off of the breakup. Because of this, we were spending quite a bit of time together doing things he probably used to do with his ex-girlfriend like movies, working out, etc. Let me preface all of this by saying prior to this I never once had feelings for Nick that extended past friendship. He was/is my best bro, and while I might have sneaked a harmless peak occasionally, I never saw him in a romantic light. 

This continued for about three weeks. One night we both fell asleep watching a movie in his bed, which led to jokes the next day about how we both kind of enjoyed sleeping next to someone. This became a regular occurrence, continuing on until one night where he confessed he had feelings for me. He said he didn't think he was gay, but he was ""gay for me"". This made me realize how much more I had grown to care about him over the previous few weeks, and I told him I felt the same way. We kissed quite a bit that night, and began to fool around over the next week.

Everything was great for about two weeks. We messed around a bit, taking it pretty slow. I started to fall extremely fast. Issues arose (yeah no pun intended) when we would start to get intimate and he would lose his erection. We both concluded it was nerves - he was new to all of this - and I didn't think it would be a problem. He was pretty sure that it would get better with time. I told him that it was fine and that we could put the sexual things aside for later. 

We continued acting like a couple for a while. Went on dates, held hands, cuddled, kissed, etc. Even though it wasn't sexual it was still incredible. I fell in love. He said he fell in love too. I had never fallen for anyone like this before. He made me feel so safe and happy that I couldn't help but fall hard. While this was going on some red flags started to arise. His ex-girlfriend would occasionally pop up on snapchat and in his text messages. I never went through his phone, but it was easy to see her name pop up. I told him how insecure this made me feel. He said that I shouldn't worry and that he was trying to help her through the breakup by being there to talk through things. Plus, she owed him a decent amount of money and he was trying to get it back. Love being blind, I accepted all of this and trusted him.

A couple weeks later I found a letter she wrote to him about how she still believed they would work out. There was some time-sensitive information in the letter, so I know it was written right when things between he and I were starting to take off. At this time he progressively got busier and busier, making it harder for us to spend time alone. There was always an excuse as to why we couldn't go do something alone - our roommates may notice, he was tired from work, etc. It felt like he was squeezing me out slowly, which it turns out he actually was. I asked him numerous times if this was what he wanted, but each time he said he still loved me and wanted to make this work. Multiple times I convinced myself to keep fighting for it to work because he led me to believe he wanted it to work out as well. Eventually it all blew up. He treated me like complete shit at the end. Wouldn't meet me one night when I needed to just end it so I could sleep. I even found out through a friend that he was still hooking up with his ex occasionally.

What hurts is that he strung me along for so long. I can take a break up. I would have preferred that he just tell me he wasn't gay and that he wanted to end it. I could have respected him for that. Instead he left me fighting for weeks and grasping at straws for a relationship that was never going to work. I know I should have seen all this coming, but I don't know how you do that to your best friend?

Fast forward to the present day. He and I live together with the same friends (signed the lease for this school year way before any of this went down). Because of this, I see him every freaking day. It's been a journey getting over it, but it still makes me sad when I think about it. A part of my heart hasn't healed yet and I just can't get back to normal. It's not that I want a relationship with him or am even still attracted to him, it's the disrespect he showed me and the lack of trust I have in him now that causes the pain. I just want the friendship back that we had before, but I can't help feeling like I was just there to fill the void or to be a failed sexual experiment. 

He has a new girl now. I feel a little sting every time she's over (quite often), and it just pisses me off because it feels like it's being rubbed in my face. I'm just so confused as to where I should go from here. He seems like such a good friend, but I question everything now because I don't know if I can trust him. I don't know if the friendship is worth it moving forward, but I'm scared to cut him out of my life because he has meant so much to me, even prior to this crappy situation. What would you guys do in this situation? Was I a complete idiot? I'm just sad about the whole thing and tired of it being on my mind. Am I being a victim and just need to suck it up? 

Sorry for the literal wall of text, I just need some clarity.

New here, but been in London (England) a while and am coming to the realization that i know so few gay men and boys in London. seems like everytime I'm out, everyone already knows each other, or are already out with their own friends. Not just in London, I suppose, but on a recent NYC holiday, i braved the gay bars in the city and really just felt like everyone was there to meet people they already knew. Of course, it probably doesn't help that I've never been one to start conversation, but i can't help but feel a lot of the time that I'm trying to get my foot in the door to a boy's club that's already closed.

It's just about my sex life in general, and I really appreciate the help this community has given me so far.  Can you all help me out?  I've just been sitting in my room crying.

I'm so depressed right now.  I should be happy.  Everything in my life is going great.  I lost 100 pounds, I got into a great grad school, and I'm doing well financially.

I was a long term sufferer of clinical depression and decided to turn my life around.  I worked hard in school and went to the gym every single day.

Stupidly, after I lost the weight, all the new attention kinda went to my head, and I started sleeping around.

I was a virgin a month ago, but I've now had unprotected sex as well as sex with multiple people (yes, I used a condom every other time).  I've also fingered a girl and then touched my penis without washing my hands.

For the past few days, I've had two tiny red bumps on my penis.  I honestly wouldn't really tell that they were there unless I shine my iPhone flashlight on them.  Next to one of the red bumps is something that looks almost like an indented scar.  Not crusty at all but a little shiny.  The bumps don't really hurt and have been there for about a week.

How do I know if I have herpes?  My university doesn't even provide a test for it in the routine screening.  

I'm so depressed right now.  I feel like I'm slipping back into depression.  I mean I was a virgin a month ago.  I know I'm an idiot, but it feels like this world doesn't ever give me a break.

This is a serious post, I'm not trolling. I'm a bi 34 year old, but have more straight tendencies than bi (I'm married to a woman, and I love her) so you'll understand why I am lost/in need of help.

Anyway, I have decided to start searching for my prostate in an attempt to add new sensations to my sex life. I've been told by straight guys alike that when you find the prostate, it's like finding heaven - no other orgasm can compare (is this true?)

I have some toys, and I Have been exploring. I have a small butt plug  (about 3 inches long, 1/2 inch wide) that I can get in with no real issues.pretty easy. But when it's in, I don't really feel much. Is it just too small to be hitting the prostate? I have larger toys but I haven' felt brave enough to try them yet. I don't know what I am scared of - probably failing to get it in, and feeling like an idiot.

I have a long torso and short(ish) arms, so I am limited with finger exploration. I can't bend myself in half at the moment (I am pretty athletic/bodybuilder but a recent car accident fucked up my back so no bending allowed). I can get up to the second knuckle on my longest finger and that's about it. Can't really reach any better than that.

How far back is the prostate? How will I know when I hit it? Is it one of those things that you have to work up to it feeling good, or does it simply feel awesome the first time around? How long did it take you to go from finger to large objects for insertion? It seems to be taking me quite a while (which bums me out). What is the best way to make a prostate orgasm happen (vibration? Rubbing? In and out motion, like getting fucked??)

My goal is to be able to cum both with my dick and my prostate - and be able to do that while having sex with my wife. ANY advice on getting to this point is appreciated. I'm a typical anal virgin - please guide me :)

I(33/M) met a college guy (19) named Justin a few months ago in the park. We instantly connected and has felt like a son to me. I invite him over to hang out and he offers a glimpse of his college life to which I offer advise in return. I've started to pick up on strong sexual tension which I haven't had in a very long time. It's a different tension than with girls and I'm not sure if it's coming from me or him. But he has to feel it. I can tell by the way he looks at me and the little things he says under his breath. Each time we see each other he gets more and more touchy which I don't mind I'm the same way but usually with girls. He's only been with 1 girl in college and every time I try to bring up girls the convo go nowhere. I believe all his friends think he's straight. 

A bit about me. My wife of 9 years and I have recently identified ourselves a openly bi earlier this year. However, Justin doesn't know that and thinks I'm straight. Not that I have tried to hide it, it just never came up. I have experimented with guys at around the age of 13 but never anything past blowjobs. Once I turned 14 I started dating a girl whom I lost my virginity with and have been with women ever since. I'm at a point in my life that I am open to any experience as long as no one gets hurt and it's pleasurable. I like to read stories about anything taboo. I've moved to gay porn to switch it up and it feels naughty and exciting. With that being said, I love the life my wife and I have together and wouldn't trade it for anyone. I can't see myself actually dating a man or maintaining a secret relationship with one but because my situation feels so taboo; I can't help but to see what happens if I just go with the flow and not over analyze anything and just do what feels natural. With the rate of how things are going, I expect one of us to make a real move in the next 2 weeks. My wife really enjoys his company too so it makes for a very interesting dynamic. When she isn't around, he will sit very close to me, put his arm around me at random, tell me how much he LOVES our friendship. Yesterday he tested me by saying he was moving out of state and paused to see how I would react. Hugs are long, goodbyes are super awkward. I'm attracted to his personality and there has been a few times the tension is so strong I have to step away because I feel one of us is going to jump on each other if I don't. I guess my question is, should I wait and see what happens? Should I make a move now or wait until it's unbearable? The other twist is we are working on a long-term project together which means we must keep our professional relationship in good standing no matter what happens.

Its been digging at the back of my mind for most of this month and I need to get it out so I am gonna put it right here.  
 
So Earlier this month I had been talking to a guy from a town not to far from me. Him and I both had mutual friends at a college town not to far so we decided to go and meet at the college and spend the weekend hanging out there together. I ended up staying and hanging out with a friend of mine who I will call Jessie. so the weekend went really really well and I had a great time hanging out with the guy who I'm gonna call Brian. Brian and I spent the Whole day together Saturday. Later that night he decided to stay in Jessie's dorm and sleep on her futon with me. So we stayed up late, played CAH and had a great time together. before we all went to bed he ended up asking me out which made me really really happy (I haven't been in a relationship  or even found a guy i felt comfortable with since last February when i broke up with my Semi-abusive ex.) the night went great and Sunday morning we all went our ways and went home. A couple days later Brian called me on Skype and said he needed to talk to me. He ended up telling me he met a girl he wanted to try to date instead of me. That he had just met her and wanted to try dating her. Turned out the girl was my friend Jessie. Truly that kind of broke me. Its not the fact I got dumped that bothered me. Its the fact she was ok with him doing it to me. she was totally ok with it and also wanted to date him. She was one of my closest and most trusted friends and she was ok with watching me feel like shit. We ended up getting in an argument and she started having her friends start texting and harassing me telling me I was a terrible person for  feeling hurt about her betraying me like that. It ended with those two basically hating me and me hating them. A few weeks after that Brian texted me and him and i started talking and he apologized for his actions and said he wants to try to date me again some day and promises if we do nothing like that will happen again. I ended up accepting his apology and him and I are having nice conversations lately and is nice to beable to talk to him again. He did suggest to Jessie that she try to talk to me because she has been feeling like shit too. So she did text me and we talked a bit and then she started getting aggressive and very rude towards me once i told her how bad it was hurting me when her friends were texting me. She ended up starting to get really mean so I just stopped talking to her and told her that I still care about her and I do wanna be friends with her but I cant if she is gonna keep acting rude towards me like that. I'm truly not sure what to do with this situation anymore. It's been adding to other stuff I've been dealing with and has been causing me a great deal of depression. I don't know what to do. I want to be friends with her again but every time i try to talk to her she gets really mean and rude towards me.

I live in Vermont.  I've lived in Portland &amp; suburbs for a total of about 2 years going on 5 years ago; I'd been living in Vermont all my life, prior to that.

My PDX experience was a failure, ultimately, due to the economy (was the height of the recession, unemployment was at 13.5%) &amp; my lack of education beyond HS, among myriad other disadvantages (lack of knowledge about social services, reliance on credit, mind-fucking relationships, emotional vulnerability - the list goes on).

Long story short: I've squandered another 5 years of my life in Vermont (with family) after attempting college and struggling through a painful unemployment period.  I'm now 30.  I've been slinging coffee as a barista for better part of the last year, saving money &amp; ignoring debt.  Emotionally, I'm no less vulnerable than before.  I still think college is something I'd like to do once I've been able to establish myself, elsewhere.

Regarding the two cities I mentioned: they're both safe-ish, relatively progressive, well-regarded &amp; far from the extreme cold of the NE.  They both, also, seem to have cultural appreciation for the arts, clean air, recreation, minimal sprawl, etc.

I'd gone to Portland, the first time, on the suggestion of several more well resourced &amp; travelled friends &amp; co-workers I had discussed my desire to leave Vt with, while working on a farm.  I'd told them I loved Burlington, Vt as it's chill, beautiful, biker friendly &amp; a little rough around the edges in that, in places like Church Street you'll find professionals rubbing shoulders with career homeless, or buskers, etc... Basically, some economic diversity not to mention YOUTH (the average age in Vt is middle age).

Austin appeals to me because of the sun, and the fact that it's a bit closer to Vermont.  I also like the idea that, being that swimming weather lasts up to 7 months there, people take better care of themselves, in general.  Cons seem to be the lack of a comprehensive biking infrastructure, coffee
 culture, adult-catering businesses (as PDX has - in terms of work), etc.  What worries me is that I take a new, expensive medication for ADHD &amp; Texas is infamously hostile to Obamacare.  I also wonder if Austin isn't just a bit more vanilla than Portland.

My concerns with Portland are: less than sunny weather, the endemic meth situation &amp; higher unemployment rate (5.7 vs 4.2, in Austin).
