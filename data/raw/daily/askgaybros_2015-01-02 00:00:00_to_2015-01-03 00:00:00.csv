Met a guy recently and one thing led to another we are gonna have sex.
Have never been with a bloke before and also it's only a fairly recent interest so I'm just looking for some tips here.

While the idea of rimming is hot to me, I don't want to take the risk at least on my first time. I've heard that the ass takes some work to get it loosened up and ready so I was wondering what kind of foreplay I could use that is less risky than rimming and will be hot for both of us?

I only seem to be attracted to the penis and balls of men. I can look at nice looking cock pics for hours and it gets me hard. I begin to fantasize sucking it or getting fucked by it and just crave dick. 

But I get turned off by masculine stuff like hairiness, manly rugged faces, or just anything except a guy's genitals basically. It's not that I find them ugly; I just get the same reaction straight men might get.

I used to get turned off by ass pics and full body pics, but it doesn't bother me that much anymore.

For example: 

if there is a picture of an attractive guy with a full body picture and a nice hard on, then I would prefer if he didn't show his face. If he was hairy, then I wouldn't get into it. If he started showing his asshole only then I would stop looking. I am just into his dick.

I also can't watch gay porn if they show a lot of their faces and kissing. I usually skip to the part where they are fucking and hope that they only show the fucking and nothing else. I also prefer it if feminine men are the bottoms and masculine the top.

I should also mention that I am attracted to women probably more than men, but I find myself fantasizing more about dicks than anything else including women. I literally fantasize about cock every time I sleep, and sometimes it gets me so horny that I just get up and jack it off.

I don't find men disgusting. Some other features besides cock also can get me going too. Nice clean abs are great, but I probably won't kiss him.

Am I bisexual or something? It's driving me crazy and I keep wondering...

So since I started using these apps I have seen people from my gym on these apps. I'm the type of person that gets flustered/embarrassed easily so my initial reaction was embarrassment. Then I laughed it off. But then I acted like nothing happened (like it should be).

I'm too chicken to initiate conversation with strangers so I just give them ""the eye"" from far away. But I'm starting to think that's weird since I tend to look roided out when I'm in the zone. It translates into ""i wanna kill you"" instead of ""please fuck me"" haha.

Anyway so the point of this thread is that i found one of the staff members of the gym on grindr haha. I think he is absolutely beautiful. I sort of got embarrassed when I checked the app but then laughed it off and said to myself ""well now he knows"". I was going to message him but I decided against it since our interactions might then turn weird.

I occasionally ask him to spot me and he might not say ""hi"" smiling to me anymore haha. (I'm such a coward).

So bros, did you ever talk to your fellow gym goers after you saw them on grindr or did you just act like you know nothing to not make a uncomfortable atmosphere, even if they were hot?

Throwaway here for obvious reasons.

I live in a large city, and am twenty-five. Anytime someone touches me, I jolt. I'm so unaccustomed to someone's physical touch, that even if a friend grabs my shoulder, it catches me off guard.

I was never sexually or physically abused. I'm accepting of my sexuality and lifestyle. I'm doing what I can to love myself more and more every day (including therapy), but I'm afraid my fear of physical intimacy isn't going away, and may be getting worse as each year passes by.

I've never really had sex. I tried once, and it didn't go well. I was a sloppy kisser, and so incredibly nervous. How could you not be? Sex is so weird. I didn't realize how weird it was until I tried having it. He was older, and more experienced. When he tried to pleasure me, my body rejected him. Although he was able to tell how uncomfortable I was, he proceeded without making me feel bad about it. Then we tried a second time. After that, we drifted apart. It was too much of an investment, and I never heard from him again.

I feel emotionally secure, and want a serious relationship more than anything. But I can't seem to put myself out there and solidify myself as a sexual being. I can't help but see my body as this weird thing that is far from sexual. 

It's no surprise that men (especially twenty-something's) can be shallow and unwilling to invest their time with an inexperienced, slightly trembling virgin (ugh, that word!). Part of me wants to find a stranger to experiment with, for the sake of trial and error, but that's so not who I am. I just don't think I'm capable meeting someone from an app like Grindr, and frankly, I have no desire to. It's especially problematic that most of the guys I'm into are a few years older. The thought of having to tell a thirty-five year old man that I'm that inexperienced just...I can't see them being okay with that.

What steps can I take towards closeness and being more in my body? How, as a TWENTY-SOMETHING GAY MALE do I tell someone I just met that I don't really know how to kiss, much less have sex? How do I rid myself of the shame of having the sexual competence of a nun? How do I get over the fact that I have a small penis? How does one smash those loud insecurities and revel in pleasure?

Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks, bros.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys,&lt;/p&gt;

I didn&amp;#39;t realize how weird it was until I tried having it. He was older, and more experienced. When he tried to pleasure me, my body rejected him. Although he was able to tell how uncomfortable I was, he proceeded without making me feel bad about it. Then we tried a second time. After that, we drifted apart. It was too much of an investment, and I never heard from him again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel emotionally secure, and want a serious relationship more than anything. But I can&amp;#39;t seem to put myself out there and solidify myself as a sexual being. I can&amp;#39;t help but see my body as this weird thing that is far from sexual. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s no surprise that men (especially twenty-something&amp;#39;s) can be shallow and unwilling to invest their time with an inexperienced, slightly trembling virgin (ugh, that word!). Part of me wants to find a stranger to experiment with, for the sake of trial and error, but that&amp;#39;s so not who I am. I just don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;m capable meeting someone from an app like Grindr, and frankly, I have no desire to. It&amp;#39;s especially problematic that most of the guys I&amp;#39;m into are a few years older. The thought of having to tell a thirty-five year old man that I&amp;#39;m that inexperienced just...I can&amp;#39;t see them being okay with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What steps can I take towards closeness and being more in my body? How, as a TWENTY-SOMETHING GAY MALE do I tell someone I just met that I don&amp;#39;t really know how to kiss, much less have sex? How do I rid myself of the shame of having the sexual competence of a nun? How do I get over the fact that I have a small penis? How does one smash those loud insecurities and revel in pleasure?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks, bros.&lt;/p&gt;

There are always guys I find attractive and I'm not so shy as to not be able to ask them on a date but I've always wondered if I should do it. I worry that if I have to do the asking, the guy probably isn't what I'm looking for. In an ideal world guys would just ask me out. But maybe I'm missing out on an entire selection of top-ish guys who might be scared to ask me out? Or maybe they're waiting for me to do it.


Do you more bro/masculine/top guys get weirded out when a more shy/slightly feminine guy like myself asks you out? Will you just ask when you want or is it nice to be approached sometimes instead of always doing the approaching?

If some people could speak to this (especially the kinds of guy I'm talking about) that would be great thanks.

I need to fill an extra room in my house which is my parents rental. They get the rent money directly so they've been bugging me to get someone else in there. So I posted an ad on Craigslist and this guy responded, and he seems really chill. I've texted him a bit and talked on the phone with him but we have never met in person and have yet to skype. So basically, I really have nothing to base my assumption that he is a good guy. He's gonna come in to town and needs a place to move into so he can start school so we will have no chance to meet in person.

So now comes the hard part, when do I tell him I'm gay? I know that a lot of people are probably gonna read this and say ""it shouldn't/doesn't matter and isn't an issue"", but like, it is. I don't want to be roommates with someone who is homophobic or an asshole without knowing. But at the same time I don't want to come off as really creepy by telling him over text. I'm pretty masculine and I'm not gonna hit on my assumed straight roommate so he doesn't have to worry about living with the stereotypical 'awful gay roommate from hell' that straight guys somehow dream up how living with a gay dude is. I just feel like it's something that should be out in the open, I don't want to live with someone who is uncomfortable with a guy dude and vise versa. So as much as it shouldn't matter, it kind of does because it could be an unfortunate deal breaker on both ends. And I would like this out in the open before papers are signed, which will be soon.

Thanks guys!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys so a little back story. I need to fill an extra room in my house which is my parents rental. They get the rent money directly so they&amp;#39;ve been bugging me to get someone else in there. So I posted an ad on Craigslist and this guy responded, and he seems really chill. I&amp;#39;ve texted him a bit and talked on the phone with him but we have never met in person and have yet to skype. So basically, I really have nothing to base my assumption that he is a good guy. He&amp;#39;s gonna come in to town and needs a place to move into so he can start school so we will have no chance to meet in person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now comes the hard part, when do I tell him I&amp;#39;m gay? I know that a lot of people are probably gonna read this and say &amp;quot;it shouldn&amp;#39;t/doesn&amp;#39;t matter and isn&amp;#39;t an issue&amp;quot;, but like, it is. I don&amp;#39;t want to be roommates with someone who is homophobic or an asshole without knowing. But at the same time I don&amp;#39;t want to come off as really creepy by telling him over text. I&amp;#39;m pretty masculine and I&amp;#39;m not gonna hit on my assumed straight roommate so he doesn&amp;#39;t have to worry about living with the stereotypical &amp;#39;awful gay roommate from hell&amp;#39; that straight guys somehow dream up how living with a gay dude is. I just feel like it&amp;#39;s something that should be out in the open, I don&amp;#39;t want to live with someone who is uncomfortable with a guy dude and vise versa. So as much as it shouldn&amp;#39;t matter, it kind of does because it could be an unfortunate deal breaker on both ends. And I would like this out in the open before papers are signed, which will be soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks guys!&lt;/p&gt;

But during this time I've wanted to have anal sex and he doesn't really, we've tried a couple times but he's to tight. We've tried a dildo and have got that in but it's a bit smaller than I am so hasn't helped really. 

But It's starting to put me off of him, he has no desire to have anal sex even though he always says he does. I've bottomed the 2 times we have had sex which took a long time as as soon as we try to put it in he goes soft. 

The longer I wait the more I want to have sex, whether it be a guy or girl (he's my first boyfriend) and I'm not sure if I want to be in a sexless relationship, even though we do other things.

Is there a way I can get him to understand this? Because I love him and I would love to spend the rest of my life with him but I'm not completely happy as we are and I don't know what to do.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, me and my boyfriend have been dating for the last 10 months and it&amp;#39;s been good.
