This guy I have been seeing for 2 months has stopped texting me. I'm fucked up. I don't know what to do, I'm a social failure.

Edit: I'm at whit's end so I just came out on facebook. Cliche, I know, but I didn't really think about it.

&gt; Do people still do this? Whatever, I'll try to keep this short.

&gt; So I like men. As in I am sexually and romantically attracted to them. As in I'm gay.

&gt; I feel the need to tell you this because I want to be honest with you. I want to live an authentic life. I'm tired of hiding my sexuality. Honestly I'm exhausted. This secret is holding me back as I try to improve as a person.

&gt; One thing I want to make clear is that I am the same person you have always known. Being gay has nothing to do with the stereotypes you might be thinking of. It is about sexual attraction, nothing more. I have always been this way, now you just know me a little better.

&gt; I know this might make some of you uncomfortable, and that is understandable. Up until recently, homosexuality has been considered something disgusting, something to hide and be ashamed of. Progress is being made, but it will take time for the negative associations to fully diminish.

&gt; I'm sorry I couldn't tell more of you in person, but even this is difficult for me. I'm not someone who likes to cause drama, especially if it brings attention to myself. :S

Again, no qualms, I'm cool with this

And then he suggests bisexual porn, Two guys on one girl. Ok, totally cool. After a while, he asks me forthright ""Can I jerk you off"". Catches me off guard, this has never happened with him or anyone else. I reluctantly say yes. 

He was really good at it, but I'm not interested in him. All day today and last night he kept trying to take it farther, ""Joking"" about it and even going as far to write ""Blow me"" on the bottom of a cup of pop he brought me from his work. 

He hasn't done anything rapey, but I don't intend on going any further with him and I don't think he's accepting that. Help?

Guess this is partly to vent and to collect my thoughts but advice is still welcome.. So where do I start? I am soon 21 years old guy from Finland, gay, mostly out and totally unexperienced when it comes to sex and relationships. And my problem is how to get rid of some bad feelings and/or ways of thinking, so when the time comes, I could proceed to have relationships and somekind of ""sexlife"".


First thing first, I came out to some of my closest friends something like three years ago, they were all cool about it and actually had been guessing it for some time. Soon after 
that, word got spread and the rest of my friends found out and nowadays mostly everybody my age or near it knows it here. And I'm completely fine with it. Parents still don't know, but I'd answer honestly if they'd ask me. It's just the time *before* I came out, I feel that the hiding in the closet has had a somewhat significant effect on my personality. Trying to deal with my sexuality back then kinda destroyed my self-esteem, I felt I became an observer, watching other people living their lives, and having their first experiences regarding sexuality etc. It's gotten better now, it's just the self-confidence that is ""yet to be found again"". Being in the closet however got me into this kind of mindset, that ""hey, you are a closet gay living in a small town, there's really no chance of getting anybody, so why just not repress your sexuality altogether"". Although I'm out now, I'm still having this kind of bad way of thinking, how do I overcome that?


Let me be clear, I understand that no one should hurry with their first times, relationships or just sexuality in general. I don't have any compulsive urge to have sex or relationship, I just fear that when the opportunity comes, I'll run away due to this mentality I have. So although I feel I'm ready, I'm extremely hesitant to make anykind of move whatsoever. Couple of my closest friends are so supportive that they have even offered me help to get laid by using Tinder, and I appreciate their good intentions, nevertheless I don't think they understand how I feel, my perspective. It's not that easy for me, a guy with no experiences of any kind, just to ""jump in"" and have sex with some stranger who came up on an app. They are used to it, I'm not, And the idea that sex and relationships, the very basic elements of the human nature, are reduced to be features on some goddamn mobile app bothers me, a lot. Or let it be a dating site or a gay bar, it's still the idea that, ""here, these are your options"" what upsets me. Don't get me wrong, I'm happy they exist, and probably I end up trying all of them.


When I was thirteen or fourteen, I would have paid anything just to be straight. After coming to terms with my sexuality, that changed, and is pretty much the opposite now. It's because I feel the struggling made me a better person overall. However, I still envy straight people, things are much easier for them (or so it seems for me). If straight guy spots a potential partner, he doesn't have to do in-depth analysis whether it is even reasonable on a very fundamental level to try hit on her (and eventually decide not to try because he can't be sure enough). These kind of things are also holding me back I guess. I mean the cold depressing fact that gay dating is hard(er). I also fear that I'm not very interesting person, and finding that person who is looking for someone like me could be like finding the needle in haystack. And I'm not talking about looks now, but my interests which tend to differ form the average. I mean, I might be a gaybro, but in a scientific way, not the beer &amp; sports way. I spent much time inside my head. I don't watch sports at all, nor tv, and I listen to some crazy ass electronic music..and really, I don't even like beer lol. Instead, talk me about neurosciense, programming, astrophysics or ask me some intriguing philosophic question, that should get me going. I really can't get much enjoyment from just chitchatting with people, sometimes it just annoys me. I'd rather shut up instead, but I guess that again is partly due to our culture haha.


What I fear the most is that one day I notice that I'm 27 and still in same position, just because I never had courage to ""change the course"". Thanks in advance for those who read this and even bothers to answer.

Being in the closet however got me into this kind of mindset, that &amp;quot;hey, you are a closet gay living in a small town, there&amp;#39;s really no chance of getting anybody, so why just not repress your sexuality altogether&amp;quot;. Although I&amp;#39;m out now, I&amp;#39;m still having this kind of bad way of thinking, how do I overcome that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me be clear, I understand that no one should hurry with their first times, relationships or just sexuality in general. I don&amp;#39;t have any compulsive urge to have sex or relationship, I just fear that when the opportunity comes, I&amp;#39;ll run away due to this mentality I have. So although I feel I&amp;#39;m ready, I&amp;#39;m extremely hesitant to make anykind of move whatsoever. Couple of my closest friends are so supportive that they have even offered me help to get laid by using Tinder, and I appreciate their good intentions, nevertheless I don&amp;#39;t think they understand how I feel, my perspective. It&amp;#39;s not that easy for me, a guy with no experiences of any kind, just to &amp;quot;jump in&amp;quot; and have sex with some stranger who came up on an app. They are used to it, I&amp;#39;m not, And the idea that sex and relationships, the very basic elements of the human nature, are reduced to be features on some goddamn mobile app bothers me, a lot. Or let it be a dating site or a gay bar, it&amp;#39;s still the idea that, &amp;quot;here, these are your options&amp;quot; what upsets me. Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, I&amp;#39;m happy they exist, and probably I end up trying all of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was thirteen or fourteen, I would have paid anything just to be straight. After coming to terms with my sexuality, that changed, and is pretty much the opposite now. It&amp;#39;s because I feel the struggling made me a better person overall. However, I still envy straight people, things are much easier for them (or so it seems for me). If straight guy spots a potential partner, he doesn&amp;#39;t have to do in-depth analysis whether it is even reasonable on a very fundamental level to try hit on her (and eventually decide not to try because he can&amp;#39;t be sure enough). These kind of things are also holding me back I guess. I mean the cold depressing fact that gay dating is hard(er). I also fear that I&amp;#39;m not very interesting person, and finding that person who is looking for someone like me could be like finding the needle in haystack. And I&amp;#39;m not talking about looks now, but my interests which tend to differ form the average. I mean, I might be a gaybro, but in a scientific way, not the beer &amp;amp; sports way. I spent much time inside my head. I don&amp;#39;t watch sports at all, nor tv, and I listen to some crazy ass electronic music..and really, I don&amp;#39;t even like beer lol. Instead, talk me about neurosciense, programming, astrophysics or ask me some intriguing philosophic question, that should get me going. I really can&amp;#39;t get much enjoyment from just chitchatting with people, sometimes it just annoys me. I&amp;#39;d rather shut up instead, but I guess that again is partly due to our culture haha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I fear the most is that one day I notice that I&amp;#39;m 27 and still in same position, just because I never had courage to &amp;quot;change the course&amp;quot;. Thanks in advance for those who read this and even bothers to answer. Let me hear if you have had same kind feelings and how did you overcome them..&lt;/p&gt;

I'm sorry if this isn't the correct sub to ask this, but I've been curious and am hoping you fine gentlemen can help me out?

So... I don't know if this is relevant but for years I've known I'm slightly bisexual, and anal play during masturbation is something I've done for a long time.  However, try as I might, I've never been able to achieve an anal-only orgasm.

My question is this... I'm able to get a few fingers in there and find my prostate with no problems, and then I'm able to get right to the edge of climax, but no further - I just can't seem to actually cum.  I can get to the point where even the faintest touch on my penis will finish me off and I can usually hit the ceiling, but I'll be damned if I can get myself to cum from prostate stimulation alone.

I've tried using a small dildo/vibrator, but the vibrations didn't seem to be any better or worse than simply using fingers.

So, guys, what the hell am I doing wrong?  I *thought* I had the technique down, but apparently not...?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

'Good Morning, I usually don't do this but  I feel you should know. I'm gonna go straight to the point. X said to me you guys are together, which is great if it wasn't for the fact that he's been sleeping with me throughout. ' 

He goes on about how he thought i should know and isn't happy with the way X handled things. I'm not the jealous type at all so this didnt really affect me much, if anything it made me happy because X guy told this guy he was seeing me? is that a weird reaction? What does he even mean by throughout ?

However, we went to a gay club the other night and X ran into a guy. The way the guy greeted him leads me to believe they werent exactly friends, maybe a one night stand, casual hook up? This guy seemed to know him but X either acted like he didnt know him or he genuinely didn't.
