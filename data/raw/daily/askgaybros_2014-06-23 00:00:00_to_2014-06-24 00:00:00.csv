We are very close, practically family.  I am close with his family as well. I am the Godfather of his soon to be Child. 

His Brother comes up this past weekend for a co-ed baby shower. We have a lot of fun. We drank, played games, yadda yadda.

Fast forward to just after the shower. We invite everyone back to our house to continue the festivities. Great time all around. Every one is drunk, everyone is enjoying themselves. I leave for a minute to go get McDonalds......... (Comeee on.... Drunk.)

I come back. Almost everyone is gone or asleep. 

I go to get in my bed and alas!!
My door is locked. What ever, I probably locked it before I left. I go in through the bathroom (they're connected)

There's my roommates brother getting dressed and some girl that he met at the shower also getting dressed.

WTF.
ok, what ever, no biggie, I'll wash the fucking sheets.

She walks out embarrassed. He looks at me with the face of ""Holy Shit that was fucking awesome but I am so sorry that I did it on your bed.""

He smiles. I laugh. 

I only laugh because I look at his shoulder and see a decent amount of cum..

""Nice Shot, man!""

He looks. ""Oh shit, can I have a shirt?""

Sure. Here you go. Gracious host, huh?

Here's the part that I feel so fucking bad/ashamed/dirty/guilty about.

I was pulling my sheets off my bed to wash them (They were at least kind enough to move them off to the side so it was just the bed liner)

I find his condom.....

What do I do Reddit?

Do you know what I did.

SERIOUSLY WTF?!
WHY!?
JESUS FUCKING CHRIST WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME!??!!!

I unwrap his used condom and eat the cum out of it....

WTF?!

I feel nasty, dirty and downright stupid. 
I know he's clean. So thats not the issue. But really!? Are you fucking kidding me?!

I see a condom on my bed that I know my buddy just got done using and my first thought is to eat his cum?!

I don't know what's wrong with me. 

My conscious is telling me I am wrong. My 'horniness' is telling me Get the Fuck over it.. He left it in your bed..

I'm currently an unemployed (although possibly to likely employed in the near future) early-20s gay man who has sex - (almost) always safe - on a relatively regular basis (once or twice a month), usually with new or non-exclusive partners.  Anyway, my three major concerns, in no particular order, are:

1. Truvada is ~$1200 a year before insurance.  I'm on my parents' insurance (which will cover it) until I'm 26, at which point I'll have to get my own insurance through work (which might not cover it, depending on the job, or if I have one...) or individually (which might be pretty tight on my budget), or I'd have to continue buying it out of pocket (ditto).

2. Two members of my immediate family have genetic conditions that indirectly affect kidney function, and theoretically might cause them to require a kidney transplant in the future, and I am a potential match for both, as well as the only one in my immediate family.  They are not *likely* to ever require a transplant, and the issues are minor and unlikely to ever require management more aggressive than mild dietary restrictions, but it is within the theoretical realm of possibility.  Taking anti-retroviral drugs causes one to be considered a poor candidate to be a kidney donor (because they damage the kidneys).

3. Truvada has a lot of pretty unpleasant side effects for something that only offers marginally greater protection against HIV than simply using condoms, which I do already (although, on the other hand, I *have* slipped up a couple of times).  I'm also not all that great at remembering to take medication every day - although I will say that I've never been prescribed anything I *need* to take every day, so it's possible I'd be more conscientious with Truvada.

Of these, I think #2 is the strongest argument against my taking it, although I wonder if I'm just being a hypochondriac by proxy and/or if it's just a poor excuse to rationalize not doing the smart thing.  On the other hand, if it ever did come to someone in my family needing a kidney donation and they died or suffered because I wasn't able to be the donor, it would be very hard for me to forgive myself.

So what I want to bitch about is how shitty and unfair it feels to not have a particularly attractive face. Body you can change, but the face is how it's going to be. When guys--even guys whom I consider to be in my own league--ignore me, it's just like ""wow sorry I happened to not have awesome genetics, sorry I just so happened to be born with a less-than-desirable face."" Attractive people always talk up this bullshit about ""oh don't listen to people, you be you and that's all that matters."" No bitch. I want to get fucked all the time, too. I want to find someone who thinks I'm fucking sexy, too. Don't tell me to control my emotions and don't tell me someone somewhere will come along someday. 

Oh but you know what the worst part is? When I realize that I'm not attracted to everyone either. It makes me feel hypocritical and it makes me realize that this fucked up bullshit is just what life is, apparently. Some of us are ugly and even us ugly one aren't attracted to each other. That is some cruel shit right there. Then you have people who say ""well then you should learn to not judge people yourself"" but that's *completely* besides my point. My point is that we're just attracted to who we're attracted to and I think it's a giant fucking cosmic joke that some of us are ugly and even we're not even attracted to each other and there's nothing we can do to change that unless we force it and fake it for affection. 

Oh, oh and then you have people who say ""well if you spend time with someone, they will start to appear more attractive to you and you will learn to love them.""

I want casual fucks with guys, too, and I don't want them to regret sleeping with me. It's so very frustrating to be a normal, horny, human being who hardly anyone wants to touch.

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t even focus on my girlfriend anymore. I feel like i&amp;#39;m lying to her. Do I even like her? Did I ever like her? Do I even like girls at all? I feel like i&amp;#39;m lying to my brothers. Am I gay or am I not? And if I am, how am I supposed to live? I can&amp;#39;t be a gay son or a gay fraternity brother. What about my girl?

I don't know who else to ask. I started going to the gym in March and was doing great for a couple of months. But then I began to experience some trouble with my heart. I'm seeing doctors currently and having tests done to figure out what's going on but, in the meantime, I can't help but think that this isn't something that'll ever be fixed.

Getting fit is really important to me. I want to have a body I'm proud of. I've been eating clean, healthy food for a while and haven't noticed much change in my body shape (all my body fat is stored on my tummy and I want it *gone*).

Fitness bros, how long do you think it might be before I start to see some real results given that I can't physically put in as much work as a normal guy?

So, entirely unhelpful answers.

I'm not really asking for medical advice here. I just have no idea what I'm doing fitness-wise and I don't know what I can expect or in what kind of timeline.

In January this year, my relationship of six years ended. I came out when I met him at the age of 21, and am 27 now. He is the only man I've ever loved, but he was manipulative too,  I was relieved to get away. There were good times, including travelling the world together, but I should have left a lot earlier.

I've been doing well since then; though am determined not to have a rebound. I want to be single for at least a year, to get bit more experience and let myself process the end of my relationship.

I met another guy about a month later (we'll call him Jason) who just seemed perfect for what I needed: he is gorgeous, has similar interests, we have great chemistry, and [crucially] he was not looking for a relationship either (or I'd have run a mile).

For the past four months, we've had 'a thing that's not a thing'. It's like a cute schoolboy crush. Basically, we really like each other and behave exactly like a couple without the strings or drama of being one. He just seems too good to be true. I see him a few times a week, and my friends all love him, but each of us is free to see other people (though we don't talk about them). No drama, ever.

One of the people I've been seeing, on occasion, is my ex. We have met up a few times, usually for insignificant reasons, but it always descends into the best sex we've ever had. I held no hard feelings towards him (I have a problem with forgiving too easily) and was fine with these encounters.

Two weeks ago I threw a housewarming party and decided my ex could come. He got really drunk and was a complete douche all night. I regretted inviting him and talked about it with Jason later.

Fast forward ten days to this past weekend. I get a text from Jason saying that he'd seen my ex out on his way home from work, and my ex had asked to catch up for a drink.

I knew I had no right to stop Jason from seeing him - after all, we're not in a relationship - so I said ""I'm sure it's innocent and he just wants to make friends. But if he tries anything you have to remember your acidic response in detail so you can replay it for me afterwards!""

I didn't think any more about it.

Last night my ex calls me. This isn't abnormal. We were just making small talk when he says ""oh, I saw Jason last night"". I tell him I already know and he seems surprised. Then tells me they just spent most of the night watching youtube videos. I'm shocked, because I realise this means he was at Jason's apartment. With my heart in my throat, I calmly ask a few more questions so I can find out what happened.

""Did anything happen?"". Awkward silence, and then he acts like he doesn't understand the question.

""Did you kiss Jason?"", I ask. Long pause. ""Maybe..."". He sounds proud of himself.

""Did you have sex with him?"". Another long pause. ""Well, we didn't have intercourse exactly...""

""But you did everything else. Didn't you"". ""Yes"".

I hang up on him. And I'm shaking. I feel physically ill. It's not black and white, but I feel as though I've been betrayed by my two closest people. The only two people I've ever loved (though of course Jason and I never used that word).

I get a text from Jason about half an hour later. My ex has obviously been in touch. Jason acts as though he has no idea I already know, and tells me what happened the night before: ""a bit of a drunken fumble"". He blames it on alcohol - my ex was too drunk to drive so he slept over - and says it was really awkward. I didn't reply.

My ex also texted me a few more times, pretending to be shocked that I care at all. ""You obviously care about Jason more than you said you do"". ""Why does it bother you so much?"". I haven't replied to him either.

I can't concentrate on anything now. I feel like I've had the wind kicked out of me and I still can't breathe. To make matters worse, I have three events this week where I am supposed to be seeing one or both of them. In fact, Jason and I are meant to be singing a duet at a concert on the weekend, that my ex has tickets for.

I have deleted my ex off facebook and will avoid seeing him if I can help it. I certainly won't be sleeping with him again. I blame him for orchestrating this. He says he didn't do it to hurt me, but I can't believe that.

But what about Jason? What he did is technically allowable within our rules, but I shouldn't have to tell him that sleeping with my ex of six years is going to crush me and ruin our 'thing that's not a thing'. 

My ex probably told him that we've seen each other a few times, which would no doubt have hurt Jason. But me sleeping with my ex is quite different from him sleeping with my ex. And, he invited my ex over *to his apartment* at 11pm while sober. So he can't just blame it on alcohol and expect everything to be fine.

First off I just want to say that the advice/encouragement I received in my previous post was really helpful.  Also thanks to the people that PM'd me with support, I can't stress how much it has helped.  I actually have managed to come out to two of my close friends as of now.  It went really well in both situations and it made me more positive about future coming out type situations.  I haven't come out to family yet since I'd like to do it in person - I'll be seeing them in two months so I'm hoping to do it then.  I'm reasonably optimistic about how it will go all things considered.    

Now that I'm in the process of actually coming out I'm kind of excited to start dating and whatnot except I'm not really sure of the best way to go about it.  I'm going to be living in Toronto starting in September and it seems like a perfect place to start dating but it also seems kind of intimidating at the same time.  I'm not really looking for hookups which seems to be primarily whats out there.  I plan on trying PoF and OKC and seeing what happens.   

As far as my online profile goes, should I be honest about recently coming out and my lack of experience (see my previous thread for info).  I'm afraid that I might scare people off a bit but I also want to be as honest as possible.  Or should I not talk about that stuff in the profile and do it in person?  I know the online dating world can be tough and I at least want to give myself a chance without completely misrepresenting myself.             

Sorry about the long post again by I just seem to have a lot of questions and no one to really ask them to.  Pretty much what I'd like to know is: If you were a late 20s guy who recently came out and is pretty inexperienced, how would you try to put yourself out there? Also, I'll be in Toronto if anyone knows any Toronto specific hangouts/social clubs/coffee shops that might be a good place to start.  I realize that there isn't only one method that works but i'd like to hear any input.  It went well last time so maybe it will again.

wrong. I know this is a cliche question, but I would like your thoughts 
on this. I am a nineteen year old bisexual who came out two months 
ago and I am semi open. I am currently a sophomore in college and 
attending Baylor University, for a unique degree, (my reason for going 
to Baylor.) At Baylor, being openly gay or bisexual is enough to get you 
into serious trouble with the university, since it has a strict view on 
sex and homosexuality. My best friends (stupidly)  thought it was a 
good idea to live in the dorms again, even though they monitor and 
filter our internet use, making being open rather difficult. I do know 
that there are other bi and gay guys attending my school, my CL for 
instance or I guess what others schools call an RA, was gay but could 
not be open due to school policies. I have also met other guys too, 
though not many (while I was closeted). I have thought about joining 
the lgbt student alliance, but they are small and in conflict with the 
administration, and I honestly do not want to risk it. As well Waco is in 
the middle of no where and its one gay bar is not what it once was. I 
was wondering since I do not have access to the apps, (I can get 
expelled for just using them) or the option of being totally open, if 
there was any way other ways to meet gay or bi guys, or make myself 
more visible to them without a huge risk of running into trouble with 
the administration or the religious student body. Thanks for your 
advice :D!

Edit clarity: By semi open I mean I am open with my friends, just not actively perusing guys in public or open to people I don't know well. If you met me you would think I am straight.

TL;DR I’m bi and just came out, if I’m not careful I’ll get kicked out of 
school. City is a dump, internet is monitored and most guys are in the 
same predicament and are not open. What can I do meet more guys?
