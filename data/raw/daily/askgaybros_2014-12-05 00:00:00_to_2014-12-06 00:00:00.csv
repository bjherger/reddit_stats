I always have guilt after hookups, but this one hit especially hard.

I'm away on travel and this guy hit me up on Grindr looking for a hookup.  Having the time and feeling like it, I said OK, he came over, and we had oral sex (he did me to completion, I gave him head for a few minutes, but didn't feel like continuing after I came).

So here's why I can't get this one out of my head: his age.  I'm 33, he's 18.  I also found out later that he's still in high school.  As someone who used to be a teacher, I can't get past the ick factor.  I didn't know him before, I'll never see him again, I don't work with his school and have no authority over him so it wasn't illegal or against any kind of policy.  Also, the age of consent in my state is 16, and because he drove himself over here, I know that he's at least of consenting age.  So my guilt is just guilt, but there are no consequences for me besides that.

I can't get the guilt of this out of my head, and need someone to tell me if I'm being crazy or not.

I didn't ask about his STD status either, so now I need to go get tested, but that's another issue even though my risk is low.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obviously, this is a throwaway account, but I&amp;#39;m having extreme guilt about a hookup I had recently.

So I initiated a conversation with a guy on Jack'd. We exchanged messages between each other and everything was going well. He didn't seem annoyed or anything of the sort,he even added winky faces if that means anything xD 

However, he hasn't replied to my last few messages (like 3) for the last two days. He had been online during those days.


 I really want to get to know him better, but I really don't want to seem like a desperate dude. So what is the appropriate time frame to start a new convo? And what *can* I say to not appear weird or creepy? 


To be honest, I really don't mind if he lost interest in me, but testing the waters one last time wouldn't hurt.

This semester, I met one of the most interesting people I've ever met. I was instantly attracted to him. I hate to have that awkward coming out story so I immediately told him I am gay and asked if he was too. He told me he is straight, but loves gay people in general. We began to hang out periodically, typically after the class that we share together. We would usually have lunch together, and just chat. He would tell me about the situations in his life and with his girlfriend. 

At first, he was quite open, and he seemed willing to be friends. I would do things that to me, a considerate friend would do for others like invite them out, surprise them at work with lunch, and just give them small gifts. When he would text me, he would say things like ""That's really sweet of you :)"" or ""I definitely plan on coming and surprising you at work sometime."" He would even send me random selfies (non sexual) and just be very flirty. Over time, his texts became more spaced out, and eventually stopped altogether. Sometimes I wouldn't hear from him for days. I tried to be rational about it, as I myself am terrible at returning calls and texts. The more we hung out, the more it happened. 

Eventually, he told me that he is just shy, and doesn't like to hang out with large groups of people so that's why he would stop texting and talking to me when I would invite him out. He also shared that he basically has to be ""friend-napped"" in order to hang out sometimes. I decided that the best thing to do, was be there for him and try and help him be more social. I began to come over and hang out, which he seemed to enjoy at first. I always made it clear that if he wasn't comfortable, to tell me. He would tell me that it's cool and he didn't mind.

Tonight however, it was different. He seemed like he wanted to get me away and talk. I knew immediately what was going to happen. I had already begun to feel intrusive and despite him telling me I wasn't I couldn't help but feel that way. He told me that he does enjoy spending time with me, but that he doesn't think our personalities are the same. He told me thinks we really don't have anything in common, but he also said ""I mean, I really like your taste in music, and I like that you vape, and your friends are really cool"" etc etc. He told me that he needs space. I agreed and said that would be for the best.

At this point I thought to myself ""you know, if we're hashing it all out, I may as well be honest and tell him what I think."" I had previously told him that I am attracted to him to which he responded ""well that is a good thing."" I recalled this during our conversation and decided to    ask him. I told him ""you know, you've been really sending me a lot of mixed signals...It was never my intention to pursue you in a romantic way but since we're talking about it I may as well say it. I don't think you're 100% straight."" He confessed that he doesn't think he is either, but that he does prefer women. I next said ""Part of me think you're attracted to me."" He opened up and said that yes, part of him IS attracted to me, and that it scares him. 

*edit* After he told me this, he became really huggy. He said, you know I'm glad that you understand and we're definitely gonna hug it out. But the thing that was weird was that he wanted a hug every few minutes. He must have hugged me at least 5 times within a 10 minute span. It was devastatingly confusing.

Here is where my questions arise:

Part of me thinks he was just saying these things under the guise of telling me what I wanted to hear, or to make me feel better.

1. Would a straight guy actually admit to being mostly straight, and kind of attracted to a guy and not actually mean it? 

2. Immediately after telling me he needed space, he began to try forming plans for us to hang out again. He said things like ""I definitely need to take you out to lunch sometime."" His birthday is coming up soon so I told him ""I know we just talked about this, but I would like to do something for your birthday"" (which is in about a month). 

3. If he is being honest, and is actually just ""mostly straight"" and is kind of attracted to me, how can I make sure I am not taking him out of his comfort zone, while still letting him know I am interested?

4. Is this just something I am gonna have to handle with finesse and with lots of time?

5. Should I just cut ties all together.

We went on a date and both agreed it was an enjoyable time. We decided to have a second date when we both got back from visiting each others' families for Thanksgiving. The only problem was, since the date, our conversations over text turned into him giving me 1 word replies and I being the one who had to start them. I'd wait a day or two to see if he'd even attempt to talk but he never would

Come time we're both back, after pressing what he wants to do for this second date, he confesses he doesn't think he's of the right mindset to be dating someone. This kinda hurt, but I understood because I've been there too and told him I completely understood and that, despite my feelings, we weren't going to continue seeing each other. However, this led to by the end of the day him sending me photos of an explicit nature he had never sent to me before. I explained that I'd like to be his friend still, but that these kind of photos were something that said he was flirting with me and it wasn't really great of him to do that to me since I like him. He then made remarks of he understood but then later more messages implying I go to his place, but when I said sure, we can hangout and spend time together, he backed out the last second.

That was two days ago. Today he continued this where he was more talkative than before and being more flirty. Then tonight he got drunk and sent me messages explicitly to come over, and yet again I said sure and he backed out. I asked him what are we, relationship-wise and his word were ""really good friends"". While that's a nice thought, I want to be more with him and have expressed this to which he brushes off in our conversations. I'd believe him too had he not shown me his tumblr page, where he posts things such as ""dating is hard"", ""I want to have someone who has a crush on me here next to me"", ""I need someone to cuddle"", these are all things he knows I saw when he linked me just the other day.

I guess my question is, what the hell do I do? I'm getting emotionally tired trying to figure out what to do. He knows I like him, he knows I would like to be with him, but it just feels like he's playing with me or doesn't know what he wants.

I asked him what are we, relationship-wise and his word were &amp;quot;really good friends&amp;quot;. While that&amp;#39;s a nice thought, I want to be more with him and have expressed this to which he brushes off in our conversations. I&amp;#39;d believe him too had he not shown me his tumblr page, where he posts things such as &amp;quot;dating is hard&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;I want to have someone who has a crush on me here next to me&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;I need someone to cuddle&amp;quot;, these are all things he knows I saw when he linked me just the other day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess my question is, what the hell do I do? I&amp;#39;m getting emotionally tired trying to figure out what to do. He knows I like him, he knows I would like to be with him, but it just feels like he&amp;#39;s playing with me or doesn&amp;#39;t know what he wants. If he doesn&amp;#39;t know what he wants, that&amp;#39;s something I can&amp;#39;t change but I&amp;#39;d just like to know, what the fuck do I do?&lt;/p&gt;

Background Info:
I'm in our school's marching band, our section includes a friend group of me, Cindy, Daniel, and Erin...and others. Erin is wonderful friends with Michael, who is a member of another section. Michael and I are out on campus... but Cindy apparently didn't know I am gay. 

The Story:
Cindy and Daniel ""dated"" earlier this year for a short time. I say ""dated"" because it was awkward as hell... because Daniel is gay and came out to Michael just before breaking up with Cindy. Then Michael and Daniel immediately started ""dating""... that's what Michael called it. But more just discreetly sleeping with each other because Daniel wasn't out out to anyone on campus but Michael, Cindy, and Erin. Cindy was hurt but kept it to herself. 

I didn't know any of this until just the other night at a party... that we went to together. At the party, Sam (He's new) and I were both making a moving on/competing over Michael. I didn't know Sam previously. Sam knows Michael via grindr and came to the party because of Michael. Sam told me about Michael And Daniel. I talked a lot with Michael, then I got really hammered. 

More Background:
I came out to myself while dating my (female) ex last year, just like the Daniel/Cindy thing, but without their awkwardness. The others didn't know this. Plus, the Erin/Michael relationship is very similar to the relationship between my ex and I. 

My Issues and Whirlwind of Emotions:
1. I could have been such a good resource for Daniel and Cindy because of my past. They didn't know and that kinda sucks for them. (And I wanted to be in the loop).
2. Daniel is tying his whole new gay identity to Michael... without even being out to some of his closest friends. I'm scared for Michael for when his thing with Michael stops. 
3. Michael should know better. Hell, they should all know better... for Daniel's sake. 
4. Michael and Daniel show zero indication of their supposed ""dating."" Michael doesn't like having to hide it all. 
5. Sam... why the fuck was he there. 
6. I'm jealous of Daniel, and was blind-sighted! Fuck, I could argue that Michael led me on. 
7. Instead of being at the party, I could have been fucking my hook-up.


Thanks for reading. Feel free to leave thoughts, advice, questions or whatever. I would, however, appreciate keeping it ""positive?"" I really don't need to be lectured. 

TL;DR I have no fucking idea how to make it more simple. I do, however,  highly encourage you to read it.

I started dating someone that I like, and he is bugging me about how important it is that I have friends..I am considering breaking up with him because of embarrassment and stress and would like advice**


Hey there. This is my first post here however I always read this site. I'm 20 years old and live in NY and I'm openly gay. Since the beginning of September I have been dating this guy..I don't know if he is my bf or not because we haven't had that talk, but we hang out all the time, are screwing each other, and don't see anyone else (at least I think! Lol jk), I just refer to him as the ""guy I'm dating"" and haven't used the words bf yet but whatever that's off topic lol.


Well we come from different backgrounds I guess, he is from the DC area (Virginia) and is here in NY to go to college, he has money and comes from a nice family and wants to be an engineer. I'm an Irish-American Brooklyn native, come from a broken family (alcoholic/druggie mom and my dad is doing 15 years in a prison in Florida), I'm poor but I work as a waiter and live on my own and I'm also going to school to work on cars. I got my GED this time lady year since I dropped out at 16. Me and him met when I made a profile on an app and we click really well. I like him and he is nice and funny and surprisingly not snobby or pretentious for someone who comes from as much of a rich and comfy life as he does.


However there is one little problem, I've always been kind of a loner and kind of antisocial. I was in a long-term relationship from 15 to 17, but besides that and some random anon hookups I pretty much have kept to myself. I was never popular and never had a lot of friends and it is always just my preference to go hang out on my own reading a book or talking to people online.  This was never a problem for me because I know the difference between being alone and being lonely, however he has noticed that I don't ever hang out with anyone but him. He has openly said that he thought that that was odd that I don't really have any friends, and he has pushed the issue several times as to why I don't. The honest answer is just because I really prefer the company of myself most of the time. I have never felt self-conscious about this, but it's starting to get annoying that he's asking me and bugging me about my solitary nature. However I don't want to seem weird by explaining to him how him trying to push the issue of me making friends is really bugging me and upsetting me. It might sound odd, but I really have no desire to make friends. I like hanging out alone or with him and at this point in my life I don't really want to change that. He has tried to get me to hang out with him and his friends from college a few times, they are very nice people and I don't dislike them but I have no desire to be friends with them at all. We have nothing in common because they all go to college and talk about that kind of stuff and that's just not what I do and what my interests are and I have nothing to talk about with them and I just don't want to hang out with them. And even if I did I probably still wouldn't want to be friends with them, not that I dislike them...but like I said I'm not a people person. Before he came around I was totally fine, content and happy. Going to work and school and spending all my free time alone. It didn't bother me at all and I enjoy relaxing, and reading. watching television, working out etc. The only reason I hang out with him is because I like him and have romantic feelings for him, that doesn't change the fact that generally I'm just a loner.


He just doesn't seem to understand that and think that there is something wrong with me, or that I'm depressed and he keeps pushing the issue of me making friends, or hanging out with his friends, or meeting new people...I know it's good natured. But it is really annoying me and getting on my nerves. It is also making me self-conscious and making me feel like I am actually an antisocial freak.
I like him, a lot. He has so many good qualities but, I am a really independent person bu nature and I don't like when people annoy me like this. It is incredibly irritating, and now I'm really remembering why I prefer my own company....because people are annoying!! He needs to accept me for who I am and realize that I don't want to make any more friends! Nor do I want to become anything more than polite acquaintances to his friends. I'm happy how I am now and I like that me and him hang out. If he can't stop bugging me and trying to change me even if it's good-natured I think I have to break up with him. He even suggested that I might have asepergers or some kind of personality disorder and that's why I'm so antisocial. (For the record, I don't!! I go to a shrink and I am diagnosed with ADHD and that's it!!) Why is it so insane that I just like being alone?? I don't understand why that's so hard for people?? The thought of always talking to people or doing things other people is enough to make my head hurt!! I see his friendships and others throughout the years and it just seems so dramatic, time consuming and emotionally tiring and I don't want it! 

With our different backgrounds do you even think we will work out? I don't want to casually date... I would like to fall in love and get married and I feel like at the end of the day, even if he likes me he probably won't want to marry or be with the white trash like me long term.

It stops the momentum, and as we build up to it again, I get the same urge to take a breath just as he gets to that point again. I feel as if there is a problem with my pacing, and it just so happened to time as he is about to cum.

So, questions: is there a method to sucking someone that I can do continuously without having to take a break? I tried breathing while doing it but it just seems so difficult. How does one even breath while sucking: through mouth while penis is inside, through nose? I think I tried to do either one, just can't remember (was focused on other things; should I put more focus on actually breathing?).

I also thought it could be that subconsciously I did not want to swallow, but I don't know how to work through that as I don't really mind swallowing cum.

Other questions: when you get the gag reflex, how do you make it go away? Getting back to sucking immediately or even after a minute after a gag reflex, I can still feel it somewhat... Do you wait for it to completely disappear, or do you fight through it and just continue?

Sorry for the very specific questions; I do not have that much experience yet and I want to improve. :D

2. I went to the bed and started to play with a prostate massage toy. Now... I have no idea how to use this thing. It's basically the same as [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/submit?selftext=true). I had the part that curves up towards the end that is inserted under my balls, and the part that curves away towards my back, thinking that one is to play with the taint and the other is the handle to pull it out. I got it in with no problem (yay!) but all I felt was pressure and a lot of burning sensations around the sphincter. I was as relaxed as I could get, and my dick had a nice semi going (yay porn) but nothing good came from my ass. I tried to angle the toy forwards, towards my dick, where I was told the prostate lives, but no magic spots. There was a point where it felt like I was going to pee and some small liquid shot out of my dick - but I don't know if it WAS pee or seminal fluid. I don't know if I had the toy in too deep, too shallow or what - I had it in as far as that curved piece would comfortably let me.

My next attempt, I have a G-spot vibrator for women that is supposed to also be usable for guys. I'm going to pop it in and turn it on, rub it around and see if I can find the spot. 

Is it possible that my prostate just feels.. bad when touched? Like maybe I have some kind of prostate issue? (I am on TRT which can fuck with the prostate) Is the burning/pressure/full feeling normal?

""A guy looking for sex in a public restroom will choose a stall farthest from the door. Someone else looking will sit in the stall right next to it. A guy looking for sex in a public restroom pulls his pants and underwear all the way down to his ankles while siting. He taps his foot, slowly at first. Both know to look at the feet. A slow up and down foot tap — so as not to rouse suspicion in the innocent shitter — which the other man will then respond to with a tap of his own. Both men tap a few more times to be absolutely certain of their intentions. Then one man will wave a hand under the stall. This is a signal that he wants to suck a dick. The other man will then put his dick under the stall and the first guy will suck it. They made trade positions.""

my question is, DOES THIS REALLY WORK??!! like omg can you imagine! and I would go and ask him but the post is archived and he hasn't been active in four years, so I came to my brothers for help :)

have any of you had an experience in stuff like this?? 

here is the original post: http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/d3a4o/iama_man_who_cruises_for_gay_sex_in_public/?sort=new","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So today I&amp;#39;m browsing reddit and come across a very, VERY, old post from about four years ago written by this guy and he talks about how he goes around and gets guys to fuck and suck and stuff in bathrooms all the time and when asked about how he gets it he said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;A guy looking for sex in a public restroom will choose a stall farthest from the door. Someone else looking will sit in the stall right next to it. A guy looking for sex in a public restroom pulls his pants and underwear all the way down to his ankles while siting. He taps his foot, slowly at first. Both know to look at the feet. A slow up and down foot tap — so as not to rouse suspicion in the innocent shitter — which the other man will then respond to with a tap of his own. Both men tap a few more times to be absolutely certain of their intentions. Then one man will wave a hand under the stall. This is a signal that he wants to suck a dick. The other man will then put his dick under the stall and the first guy will suck it. They made trade positions.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;my question is, DOES THIS REALLY WORK??!! like omg can you imagine! and I would go and ask him but the post is archived and he hasn&amp;#39;t been active in four years, so I came to my brothers for help :)&lt;/p&gt;

We had been really good friends before we officially began a romantic relationship, dated about a month,  decided it just wasn't working, and broke up. We stayed friends after, and because we went to school together we saw each other nearly every day. We were both going through a lot and communication dwindled until it died during the summer when I moved across the country to spend the summer in New York. C got his life together, got a new boyfriend, and is doing well for himself. I texted him the other day after not talking for 4 months to apologize for how I acted and what not, and we made any amends that hadn't been settled months before. I asked if he wanted to get together some time -as friends- to catch up and he was all for it, but I got a text last night from C saying that his boyfriend didn't want him to have lunch with an ex. 
I completely understand his boyfriend's feelings, but is it selfish of me to pressure C into talking it out with his boyfriend so I can still catch up with a good friend? I haven't texted him back yet because I didn't want to dau the wrong thing. Any suggestions on what to say?
