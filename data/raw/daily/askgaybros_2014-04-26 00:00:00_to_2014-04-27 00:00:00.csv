So, the first thing - i have a hard time falling asleep. I am pretty new to ""gay scene"" (if i can call it like that). I have been with 3 male partners or slept overnight with them beside me in a sexual way.   
-So, the thing is with the first one I remember that I did not really sleep all night, but I didn't think that it was an issue because I cherished every moment of it.   
-Second one was my fuck buddy and after we had our fun (no penetrative sex) we just went to sleep, but I could not get myself to actually sleep. Not only I was sweating like in gym, but I was constantly awake. We slept together 2 nights and both of them I was not really sleeping, maybe hour here and there, but I still was tired in the morning.  
-And the third guy. After *the fun* we went to sleep and I think that first hour I was not sleeping, but tired and not really awake, not to mention those sweats yet again.
So, my question - I will have to wait some time that my body would adjust to sleeping with someone else? And how about those sweats? We were naked in a room with fresh air.. I don't even sweat that much in athletics when I am running or doing something like that. Is my friend correct that she assumes that I have to wait even more to get over this 'not really sleeping - yet not awake' phase?  
And a quick question - what movie would you suggest for a movie night where I would like to start watching with clothes and at the end or middle of that movie - in bed with less clothes. (That would be out second date)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone.

he's 56 and he's lived through a lot. he was a cop until recently, and he was outed to his department in an unfortunate way. one of his partners died of AIDS before i was born, one of his partners left him because he gained weight, and the most recent partner relied on him for money for years before cheating on him. he's also had a ton of bad experiences dating.

i love this man, but i do not plan on staying with him, and he's known that since day one. but, he's an AMAZING guy and would be the best husband i can imagine. he's an accomplished hunter, fisherman, diver, gardener, birdwatcher, and proud owner of two brilliant hunting dogs that never leave his side. the boyish grin and intelligence aren't bad either.

**here's where the questions start: is there any way he could start dating without dealing with shithead internet people? is the internet dating thing REALLY geared toward finding compatible people or just viewing ads and paying for apps? it seems most outdoorsy 50-year-old gay dudes don't like looking for love on the internet, does it seem likely he's going to find anyone if he tried? what is the % chance that he'll meet a lifelong snuggle-buddy on the net without having to wade through a depressing shitstorm of morons for a few years?**

he's on five very popular dating sites (i met him on mister.com) and his profile is tight, but i think the messages he gets and the profiles he ends up looking at and messaging really depresses him. he's had a lot of people flat-out lie to him and then not even try to keep up with the lies, figuring he's just in it for sex anyway. he's also felt the cruelty some internet fucktards dispense which probably remind him of the shitty experiences of coming out.

i've tried to softly approach the topic of dating, because i'll be leaving the country for the summer and it would be a good time for him to let his hair down (we're both balding :D ) and he can go rabble-rouse with some dudes he might end up being interested in. i told him if he ends up dating someone i'd still be physically attracted to him and we could talk about 3-ways and barbecues and other kinds of fun. i've always been very clear that he's my friend to the end. we very quickly started acting like brothers, maybe because we both have brothers and our fraternal careers, and i really just want to support him. nothing would make me more happy than seeing him marry some young buck and find another dog. it brings a tear to my eye.

we've had some rough patches because of disagreements or perceived insults, but i'm chalking it up to his troubled law enforcement career and my troubled stint in the military. we both speak a little too aggressively and act defensive very quickly. it's instinctual for him to close himself off, i only notice because i do the same thing.

I guess the more time they spend with me they pick up on little things. A couple of friends have asked me, but I always denied it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this is the first step in coming to terms with it. Maybe down the road I could come out to people close to me. My parents are pretty right wing conservative, but I think my mom might be more accepting.  I would definitely start with friends, maybe my older sister. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not looking for hookups or anything like that. I&amp;#39;m in the columbus Ohio area.  I&amp;#39;m pretty much a typical geeky gamer guy.  Anyways, I just discovered gaybros and wanted to say hi. &lt;/p&gt;

I'm 19 and in the process of accepting myself and being honest about who I am. Over the last three weeks I've come out to my father, mother, sister and brother, in that order. 

The last person I really wanna tell is my best friend. We've been best buddies since the beginning of middle school and done basically everything together but I've never been able to tell him I'm gay.

He's from a very Christian family and I know his parents are hugely anti gay and have first hand experience of that but my friend had never really expressed any feelings about the subject until recently.

We live in Texas and recently a Texas state judge ruled the same-sex marriage ban unconstitutional and my friend for the first time became vocal on the subject saying how wrong it was that these judges were forcing gay marriages on the Christians in this state. I did argue back, I told him no church will ever be forced to marry gays but the state should allow gay people to get a marriage license. He wasn't pleased and continued talking about how this would just make God angry and that Christians wouldn't be doing their Lord justice if they didn't stand up to these things.

I did mention a gay guy that we know and asked him why he shouldn't be able to get married and have a family, he said this was a free country and he could do whatever he want but that the state shouldn't be seen supporting that behavior by changing the definition of marriage.

Don't know what to do.. he's been my rock for the past 5 years and I know he won't abandon me but I'm afraid that it will change our friendship.

I'm hoping that someonout there can help me/offer some advice, as I've been going out of my mind, I'm a bag of nerves.

I've started seeing a guy who I met on tinder, and we've been going out for about a month and a half now. The other night he told me tested positive for HIV last year after being attacked and raped in Colombia.

We've not had sex or anything like that, but obviously there is now a massive roadblock in our relationship, when it had been going so well.  I really like this guy.

I'm wondering if anyone here has any advice on what I should do, if there's anyway I can continue being in this relationship whilst being safe, and 99.99999999999999% risk free or if I should cut and run.

I read something about a pill that stops the virus taking hold if there is an ""breach of security"" so to speak?  Is that an actual option, is it 100% effective?

I'm live in the UK if that has any relevance to health care/risk prevention etc etc?

Thanks guys, kisses.

My partner and I have been together for about 6 months now and we both were sleeping with other people for the first couple of months. As time is passing (and after having been in previous relationships in the long term, 2+ years) my feelings have started to become more serious and I am intending to be fully committed to this man. Here's the thing though. He gets an ego boost from sleeping with younger guys, something that I can't provide given that I am his age. I understand the appeal I suppose, it's not really my thing, but he mainly does it because he is rather well endowed and likes to see younger guys fawning over him for it. I have been doing all I can, communicating my feelings, and he says that he wishes that he didn't feel the urge to do it, but he does still want to. I know he l know cares for me and respects my feelings on this subject, he often tells me that with the other guys it's just the ego boost whereas when WE are intimate, it's because he wants me to feel good, something he swears is very different. I just want some advice or feedback on my situation as I am trying to understand my partners way of thinking and I want our relationship to last as I can see a wonderful future ahead. Please help me if you can, thanks gaybros! xo","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, I&amp;#39;ll try to keep this simple.
