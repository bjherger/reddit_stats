Currently living in Chicago (lgbt community is decent i guess, dont know how its like in other cities), and 23 years old. 


Lately I'm having trouble meeting people with similar interest other than dick. I've been going to my college LGBT pride meetings, and didn't really find anyone who share a common interest. I have more gay *acquaintances* than I do friends.


Aside from common interests, I'm also talking about meeting and befriending guys where there isn't sexual tension present, just guys to hang out and be social with...without sex. 
**I do** have gay friends, but how we met was pretty much purely sexual ... finding each other attractive and letting it go from there. Unless I've been living in a rock and sexual interest is how gay friendships form.. Although, I'm sure some of you have friends who are gay, but would never want to perform oral to.


But what makes shit hit the fan is that I'm sexually attracted to older guys. So most of my gay friends.. are older than myself. And by default, that separates them with the friends I have who are my age(straight friends if that matter). There are certain things you can do with friends your own age that you can't with a man in his late 30s. 


**tl;dr - I have no gay friends who share anything in common and are of my own age. And being sexually attracted to older guys makes my situation even worse. I also want gay friends where there's no mutual attraction involved aka sex**

Never had a relationship with a guy, would like some help in figuring out how to approach or just general advice!

**Rambly story ahead:** So I'm in my second year at college, and the dorm I'm in is super communal (housing and dining co-op). The beginning of this semester a few people switched in and out, and one of those who switched in is the guy I'm interested in (call him S).

Anyways, so the beginning of the semester I started out thinking he was cute but dismissed it since I knew nothing about him. I'm pretty comfortable regardless, so even with that in mind I did small stuff like ruffle his hair or touch his shoulder from time to time.

Over the past few weeks we've talked and hung out with mutual friends more often, and I've really grown to like his personality and his demeanor (did I mention he's super cute?) I talked about my silly crush on him with a good friend of mine (call her C) who is also his roommate as sort of a joke (aka haha I have this crush on him but he's probably straight so it's just me being sexually frustrated) and it turns out he's bisexual. So of course I'm now more interested in him and learned that he is currently single too.

So last weekend we were in C and S's room along with a bunch of my other good friends just playing Cards Against Humanity and another mutual friend of ours walks in. I'm very comfortable being affectionate among my friends, so she hugs me and I hug back, and my friends join in on this. Since S is new to the co-op this semester, he's the only one who isn't really close friends with everyone else in the room, and I figured it must be kind of intimidating to try and make friends with this already pre-established friend group of your roommate. So to make him feel welcome I say ""Hey S, you should totally join us!"" He does and we all have a good hug, and after a bit we end it. Except he's still cuddling me (or more like I'm still cuddling him but he doesn't make a motion to end it or get up) with his shoulder rested against my chest and my arm around his waist. It was really nice and the first time I've had that sort of semi-flirty thing with a guy, and some of our friends noticed and commented that we're being very cute right then.

Since then I've tried to find excuses to interact with him since, well, I'm pretty infatuated. Last Sunday morning I was in the kitchen and saw him walking in from the front door with one of our friends and I just say hi and motion them to hug (mostly to my friend since we're super comfortable and I didn't want to weird S out). Surprisingly S hugs me first without any hesitation, and comments on how warm I am (also the way he speaks really turns me on) which got me flustered and I commented back something like ""Oh uh... yeah well you were outside so you're cold."" Super smooth I know.

Later that night I go to C and S's room to talk with C about homework, and as I'm leaving the room, S is coming in at the same time. We're both kind of surprised so I just say ""Hey how are you?"" and he smiles and says that he's good. He then walks back into the room and as he does so he grabs my shoulder (like a good squeeze, I'm not very muscular but I do a lot of hiking and semi-regularly go to the gym.) I was super taken aback but I really like him, so I tried to grab his shoulder too, which was mostly a success but more fumbly, but I basically just wanted him to know that I'm totally down to reciprocate his gestures.

So yeah, that really turned me on and really started my growing crush on him. I was talking about it with a friend today and we were making cookies in the kitchen. The co-op has bunch of cookie cutters and one of them is heart-shaped, so I jokingly say that we should make some heart-shaped cookies so I can give them to S. We actually end up doing it and I plan to give them to him when he's in his room. Later that night I know that C is out of the room, so I go to check to see if S is in his room knowing that if he was, he would be by himself. He is and I offer him the cookies and he really likes them and asks if he can give me a hug because they're so good. I happily oblige and give him a tight hug, and after that we make small talk and I leave to go back to my room.

Also that entire time he was shirtless. Aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh

So my dilemma is that I of course want to read into everything as him flirting with me because that's obviously what I want, but I know that I will be biased. So I guess I'm looking for other people's opinions? Also just general advice too, and how to handle this situation/how to progress forward if it seems like he's reciprocating.

Sorry for the super long post, but this has really been distracting me considering it's the first guy I get these tingly feelings for  : (

Also good lord he's so adorable. Like seriously I want to throw him onto the couch, pin his hands down, straddle his waist, unbutton his shirt, nibble at his collarbone and slowly work my way down... yeah I'm sexually frustrated...


**TL;DR I like a guy, I think he seems to be reciprocating??? But I'm oblivious and want outside advice on whether he is actually flirting back or I'm just reading too much into this. Also where do I go from here??? How do I make the next move??? I want to do things to and with him that involve body parts!!!

&lt;p&gt;Over the past few weeks we&amp;#39;ve talked and hung out with mutual friends more often, and I&amp;#39;ve really grown to like his personality and his demeanor (did I mention he&amp;#39;s super cute?) I talked about my silly crush on him with a good friend of mine (call her C) who is also his roommate as sort of a joke (aka haha I have this crush on him but he&amp;#39;s probably straight so it&amp;#39;s just me being sexually frustrated) and it turns out he&amp;#39;s bisexual. So of course I&amp;#39;m now more interested in him and learned that he is currently single too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So last weekend we were in C and S&amp;#39;s room along with a bunch of my other good friends just playing Cards Against Humanity and another mutual friend of ours walks in. I&amp;#39;m very comfortable being affectionate among my friends, so she hugs me and I hug back, and my friends join in on this. Since S is new to the co-op this semester, he&amp;#39;s the only one who isn&amp;#39;t really close friends with everyone else in the room, and I figured it must be kind of intimidating to try and make friends with this already pre-established friend group of your roommate. So to make him feel welcome I say &amp;quot;Hey S, you should totally join us!&amp;quot; He does and we all have a good hug, and after a bit we end it. Except he&amp;#39;s still cuddling me (or more like I&amp;#39;m still cuddling him but he doesn&amp;#39;t make a motion to end it or get up) with his shoulder rested against my chest and my arm around his waist. It was really nice and the first time I&amp;#39;ve had that sort of semi-flirty thing with a guy, and some of our friends noticed and commented that we&amp;#39;re being very cute right then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then I&amp;#39;ve tried to find excuses to interact with him since, well, I&amp;#39;m pretty infatuated. Last Sunday morning I was in the kitchen and saw him walking in from the front door with one of our friends and I just say hi and motion them to hug (mostly to my friend since we&amp;#39;re super comfortable and I didn&amp;#39;t want to weird S out). Surprisingly S hugs me first without any hesitation, and comments on how warm I am (also the way he speaks really turns me on) which got me flustered and I commented back something like &amp;quot;Oh uh... yeah well you were outside so you&amp;#39;re cold.&amp;quot; Super smooth I know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later that night I go to C and S&amp;#39;s room to talk with C about homework, and as I&amp;#39;m leaving the room, S is coming in at the same time. We&amp;#39;re both kind of surprised so I just say &amp;quot;Hey how are you?&amp;quot; and he smiles and says that he&amp;#39;s good. He then walks back into the room and as he does so he grabs my shoulder (like a good squeeze, I&amp;#39;m not very muscular but I do a lot of hiking and semi-regularly go to the gym.) I was super taken aback but I really like him, so I tried to grab his shoulder too, which was mostly a success but more fumbly, but I basically just wanted him to know that I&amp;#39;m totally down to reciprocate his gestures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah, that really turned me on and really started my growing crush on him. I was talking about it with a friend today and we were making cookies in the kitchen. The co-op has bunch of cookie cutters and one of them is heart-shaped, so I jokingly say that we should make some heart-shaped cookies so I can give them to S. We actually end up doing it and I plan to give them to him when he&amp;#39;s in his room. Later that night I know that C is out of the room, so I go to check to see if S is in his room knowing that if he was, he would be by himself. He is and I offer him the cookies and he really likes them and asks if he can give me a hug because they&amp;#39;re so good. I happily oblige and give him a tight hug, and after that we make small talk and I leave to go back to my room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also that entire time he was shirtless. Aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my dilemma is that I of course want to read into everything as him flirting with me because that&amp;#39;s obviously what I want, but I know that I will be biased. So I guess I&amp;#39;m looking for other people&amp;#39;s opinions? Also just general advice too, and how to handle this situation/how to progress forward if it seems like he&amp;#39;s reciprocating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the super long post, but this has really been distracting me considering it&amp;#39;s the first guy I get these tingly feelings for  : (&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also good lord he&amp;#39;s so adorable. Like seriously I want to throw him onto the couch, pin his hands down, straddle his waist, unbutton his shirt, nibble at his collarbone and slowly work my way down... yeah I&amp;#39;m sexually frustrated...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR I like a guy, I think he seems to be reciprocating??? But I&amp;#39;m oblivious and want outside advice on whether he is actually flirting back or I&amp;#39;m just reading too much into this. Also where do I go from here??? How do I make the next move??? I want to do things to and with him that involve body parts!!! Aaaaahhhh hormones&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I met this friend from another friend in a chat room. he lives far away from me luckily and we have been friends for a couple of months or so.

I sadly don't know how to interact with him so I've just been oblivious to even his obvious flirtatious comments. recently hes been chatting me in private being a being a little more interested in me. i stupidly gave him a pic of me (Since he had already sent a pic of him) and now hes more in love. the biggest problem is that he told me his age. he is 15. i am very uncomfortable with this since i even find it uncomfortable to be in love with someone. i have never had sex or a relationship to begin with. he is very suggestive and chats about casual horny teenager things and its making me uncomfortable. i am perfectly fine with the idea of me and him being a couple... if we were over 18 but now i'm just afraid he might do things like try to get together or even worse send me send me pics i don't want. he is the type of person who would do that.  
so finally i don't know what to do. should i go against my policy or should i just stick with it? is it normal to feel like this? am i just paranoid? once again I am fine with waiting until he is older and maybe going out with him but i don't think he has the patience.

I went in for testing last week. The results came back. I got a call from the counselor, and she told me I tested positive for Gonorrhea. I asked her about the NAT test (HIV RNA test), which was accurate at 3 weeks post risk encounter and she told me it was negative. 

How do I feel? Confused, scared, and grateful, ashamed, relieved, and nervous. This is my first STI, and I am hoping it would be my last. 

Thankfully, I have the guys number and I called him. However, he was very hostile and accused me of giving him an STD.. He said he is going to get tested tomorrow morning, but still very much in denial. 

The counselor made an appointment for Wednesday, so I'll take the medications. I am just very grateful I do not have HIV, and I have since deleted Grindr. That would be my last hook up, as I will practice abstinence until I have a monogamous relationship.

And I've already done the All American Heroes, ChaosMen, Sean Cody, Straight Fraternity, and Collegemen 24/7 thing. Assume that if it's a big site, I've downloaded all the videos already :)

Any suggestions?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, here&amp;#39;s the deal...&lt;/p&gt;

I've never had a boyfriend. Until one month ago I was even a virgin. I lost my virginity in a one night stand. I already regret it because the guy was only ok looking. Since I'm very attractive I always imagined I'd lose my virginity to a similarly attractive guy. But that's a topic for another day.

I have crush on a friend. He doesn't know I'm into guys because I'm too scared to tell him. I'm not sure at all what his sexual orientation is.

I would like to tell you some things about his behaviour when we're together. It would be great if you could interpret his behaviour. I'm usually great at interpreting other people's behaviour but I want to be on the safe side before I finally make a move.

I've used taking a photo of both of us as an excuse to get really close to him, and put my hand on his shoulder. He didn't say anything or push it away. That gives me some hope.

However, a few days ago I was at an event with my crush and some female, middle-aged friends of ours. Unlike him, they know I'm gay. I really didn't have a nice time at that event. Somehow everyone talked to each other but no one paid me any attention. So I stood by myself, hoping that they would notice but they didn't. I felt really excluded.

What hurt especially was that my crush was happily talking to our middle-aged female friends. They all seemed happy.He's my age, so I'm obviously not worried about him talking to our married, middle-aged female friends. Still, I felt quite rejected by him, and also socially rejected in general.

I recently posted a really funny text he sent me on Facebook. It got several likes but he was not one of the people who liked it. I'm too scared to ask him why he didn't press the like button. He has pressed the like button for some of my other posts in the past though.

Ever since the 8th grade when I jokingly told my friend on april fools I was gay, did I start actually considering the fact that I may be gay. I'm 19 now and just told my first friend that I was gay. Why the wait... well... I come from a very religious family (go figure) and while I never doubt my feelings it's harder to tell people that I am gay. However, part of the problem is that I don't even know if I am gay. As a person I am very timid and introverted. I never really wanted to approach anyone or take the initiative. What I am afraid of is that my disinterest in girls may actually be caused by this. I never want to take the initiative and for this reason don't picture myself having sex with a girl. Maybe looking at love under the light of dominance/submissive is superficial but I feel like there is some truth behind this. I can't really picture myself getting in a relationship with a girl because I'd be the dominant figure, however, their body shape can sometimes turn me on as well as when a girl takes the initiative to flirt with me. What doesn't turn me on is the thought of engaging contact with them. This is the key difference between my interest in girls and guys. Guys taking the initiative and flirting with me (I think, this hasn't happened; I am still closeted after all) turns me on and the thought of engaging contact with them DOES turn me on (because I can take the submissive role). When it comes to guys though I am waaayy more picky with how they look then I am girls. I find more girls good looking compared to seeing guys that I find to be good looking. When I do see a guy that looks right though it can REALLY turn me on. 
Now, I don't want to sound like a douche, but another thing about gays that kinda confuses/scares me is the really flamboyant dramatic guys. I'm not saying this is wrong and for those that are like this more power to you but I am afraid that this fear and my fear of the stereotypical social media relationships could further be muddying my feelings. Or maybe these feelings are stemming from me having yet to accept who I am. Obviously I know it comes down to myself when figuring out who I am attracted to but I'm just interested in hearing your guys feedback. Perhaps even one of you have been in my shoes. 
In summary both female and male looks turn me in but I am much pickier when it comes to guys. Only a really niche group of guys turn me on. Having an intimate relationship with a guy turns me on where with a girl does not. Maybe that makes it sound obvious that I am gay but after just speaking to one of my friends about this I feel like I'm in denial and still fill a lil weird about getting in a relationship with another guy. I'd love to go out and experiment but I am so introverted and never even been in a real relationship. Closest thing to physical contact with someone is when a girl tried holding my hand in high school. I didn't know how to respond and flipped out. It's also hard to go experiment when I live in a conservative town and have yet to come out to my family. I'm just feeling a little confused and don't know what to do.

Regardless, I'd still like a bit of advice on how to approach this situation! 

I told a good girlfriend of mine, who I'll call Susy (idfk), back in January, and in the following month her three best girlfriends ""figured out"" that I'm gay. Supposedly they could just tell by mine and Susy's relationship. And that may very well be the case, that's not what this post is about. It's about her telling my male best friend. She told him today, and also told him who I've currently got a bit of a romantic relationship with. So she not only outed me, but also my (kind of) boyfriend. 

Now here's the other part of the problem. I clearly don't want to be friends with somebody who goes around telling others that secret when I've explained to her multiple times how important it is that she keep her mouth shut about it... But, I'm worried what she'll do once I'm no longer close with her. If I blow up at her I think that she will definitely tell other people as some pathetic way to get back at me, and if I stop communicating with her altogether (excluding when I do calmly confront her) I feel that the chances are pretty high she'll continue to tell people. If she's already spreading it when I'm her ""bae"" (ugh) what's going to happen when I'm not a part of her life? That may seem a bit dramatic, and honestly it is, but that is really a lot like her personality.

Been wanting to ask this question for a while but the LGBT subreddits never felt right to me so I've sorta dealt with this internally for a while and spoke to a few close friends but today I suddenly remembered gaybros is a thing and this might be a community with a better understanding or track record of this kind of thing.

Firstly, I'll say I seem to get an incredible amount of attention from straight guys. More than anybody else, I understand sexuality is fluid but for some reason, with male friends of mine a lot of it becomes directed at me. I've had everything from simple comments like ""if I was that way inclined I would..."" to having full on sexual encounters with straight friends of mine. I think the sum of those experience is possibly at play now and making me feel the way I do about my best bro.

I live in England, but born and raised in the US. My buddy is the best bro I have this side of the pond and we spend an absurd amount of time with each other. I should say we do live together but hanging out as much as we do is quite a new thing. When we first started living together we were just friends and it was the usual thing of spending time in our own rooms and sometimes hanging out in the living room with each other. About 4 months after move-in my job sent me on assignment to a different part of the country for a few weeks and a funny thing happened, the things I found a bit annoying about my bro were the things I suddenly really missed. Needless to say I was happy to get back! Then he had an injury about two weeks after and had to go back to his parents for a few weeks. When he returned is when it all changed, we started hanging out more and more, drinking together, going grocery shopping together, going for meals together. We talk about everything and while theres still a few walls in our friendship we have had moments where we share things I don't think either of us would have shared willingly with others. All in all, a pretty solid friendship and for the most part I don't necessarily think too much into any of these things. But there are things that make me wonder.

A few times when I've spoken to guys he seems to become a bit distant. Never asking how my dates went (not that I date often) or asking anything about the guys trying to talk to me. I've only ever brought a guy home once and my bro basically went straight into his room and went to sleep so he didn't have to hear or know about anything. My bro also uses the word 'we' and 'ours' a lot even in situations that only relate to one of us, for example I went home for Christmas by myself, and he said ""we need to find out how much duty free alcohol we can bring back."" Don't get me wrong, I actually love that we've become this close and we have this mutual shared approach to everything. On that note, how much time can you actually spend with someone and actually not be tired of their presence? This question actually floors me because even my close friends I've known for years still get a bit under my skin after a few hours or days. (BTW, I do give my bro his space and I make sure to take some for myself). When I was gone for Christmas my bro did absolutely nothing. We're both big foodies and craft beer drinkers but while I was gone not a single beer was opened (not even the ones he go for Christmas which I wouldn't have known about) and he was eating microwave meals (We always cook or go out, but I've never even heard my bro suggest a microwave meal much less seen him eat one!) 

Other little things that make me question, he regularly texts me on his lunch break and sometimes he looks in my eyes a little too long, or I catch him looking over at me while were watching tv.

After Christmas, my bro and I went for a night out and he got some girls number (again something I've never seen him do, he's quite shy) I can't say it didn't sting. I fucking wanted to melt into the floor that night but it made me realise I have feelings beyond friendship for this guy. He never talked much about her after that but he did spend the next few days on Tinder which also made me a bit anxious. TBH, he doesn't date much at all, his last relationship was 4 years ago, hook ups aren't his thing; hell, to be completely honest he doesn't even have many friends, so we never talk much about his dating life but I know he wants someone. My bro is someone who doesn't talk about his emotions a lot and he's not the kind of guy to touch during a conversation, typical signs you might check for to see if someone's interested. Lastly, as far as his sexuality goes, he understands there's a difference between sexual attraction and romantic attraction so while he's not generally sexually attracted to men, he knows he could be romantically attracted to any gender (really switched on thinking like this is how he became my bro in the first place).

Anyway I've dragged this post out long enough basically I've held my tongue on telling him how I feel. I thought the best course of action is to be patient and just let that conversation happen naturally, not to force it. Does anybody have any thoughts for or against this approach? Has anybody here ever seriously dated their straight bros, how did it happen and what were the signs it was getting to be more than a bromance?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey bros,&lt;/p&gt;

My bro also uses the word &amp;#39;we&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;ours&amp;#39; a lot even in situations that only relate to one of us, for example I went home for Christmas by myself, and he said &amp;quot;we need to find out how much duty free alcohol we can bring back.&amp;quot; Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, I actually love that we&amp;#39;ve become this close and we have this mutual shared approach to everything. On that note, how much time can you actually spend with someone and actually not be tired of their presence? This question actually floors me because even my close friends I&amp;#39;ve known for years still get a bit under my skin after a few hours or days. (BTW, I do give my bro his space and I make sure to take some for myself). When I was gone for Christmas my bro did absolutely nothing. We&amp;#39;re both big foodies and craft beer drinkers but while I was gone not a single beer was opened (not even the ones he go for Christmas which I wouldn&amp;#39;t have known about) and he was eating microwave meals (We always cook or go out, but I&amp;#39;ve never even heard my bro suggest a microwave meal much less seen him eat one!) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other little things that make me question, he regularly texts me on his lunch break and sometimes he looks in my eyes a little too long, or I catch him looking over at me while were watching tv.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Christmas, my bro and I went for a night out and he got some girls number (again something I&amp;#39;ve never seen him do, he&amp;#39;s quite shy) I can&amp;#39;t say it didn&amp;#39;t sting. I fucking wanted to melt into the floor that night but it made me realise I have feelings beyond friendship for this guy. He never talked much about her after that but he did spend the next few days on Tinder which also made me a bit anxious. TBH, he doesn&amp;#39;t date much at all, his last relationship was 4 years ago, hook ups aren&amp;#39;t his thing; hell, to be completely honest he doesn&amp;#39;t even have many friends, so we never talk much about his dating life but I know he wants someone. My bro is someone who doesn&amp;#39;t talk about his emotions a lot and he&amp;#39;s not the kind of guy to touch during a conversation, typical signs you might check for to see if someone&amp;#39;s interested. Lastly, as far as his sexuality goes, he understands there&amp;#39;s a difference between sexual attraction and romantic attraction so while he&amp;#39;s not generally sexually attracted to men, he knows he could be romantically attracted to any gender (really switched on thinking like this is how he became my bro in the first place).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway I&amp;#39;ve dragged this post out long enough basically I&amp;#39;ve held my tongue on telling him how I feel. I thought the best course of action is to be patient and just let that conversation happen naturally, not to force it. Does anybody have any thoughts for or against this approach? Has anybody here ever seriously dated their straight bros, how did it happen and what were the signs it was getting to be more than a bromance?&lt;/p&gt;

To paint a picture of my situation. My city's gay scene is miniscule (one gay night a week under a C-grade hotel in a sketchy part of town, inhabited by the same guys that were in the since-closed-down gay bars when I was 17 sneaking into places using fake ID) and being gay isn't something that's massively supported - in terms of chances to meet guys - like clubs or cafes or gay only events. 24 years living here and I've never seen people of the same sex holding hands on the street. 24 hours in Manchester (when I was there) and I saw countless gay couples holding hands in public. Two girls got beat up two weeks ago for holding hands walking down a street at night, which made national news. That's not saying I live in the Middle East - but it shows that the part I live is still a bit backwards and not totally gay friendly. Don't get me wrong, it's actually rare I meet someone who hates gay people, but it still seems like it's not a thing people parade around. We have gays of course, but it seems like they're all hidden? Definitely a far cry from Manchester, haha!

I use apps, but I rarely meet guys off them. Sometimes because I don't want to, but mostly because they don't. Guys I message sometimes won't reply, or if they do the conversation kinda fizzles from either party. Sometimes from lack of interest on my side. Sometimes because they won't even send a picture. I feel like it happens often to me. More often than it should. Especially reading some of the stories on here. I try to reply to most guys who chat me (because I hate the feeling when a guy you message doesn't reply to you) and if I don't have an attraction for them, I see if there's a deeper connection, but it's hard when the attraction isn't there. I use Tinder. Some guys like me, so I take initiative and send a message like, ""Hey, how are you doing today man?"" and yet.... rarely a reply? Some do. I don't want to act like I'm desolate, but it really isn't an easy/everyday thing that it seems to be with others. I have met guys for dates and hookups, but I can count them on two hands since I came out at 15 - which is 9 years ago. I don't put too much hope into apps because I might be unlucky with guys, but I'm not an idiot and know that Grindr/apps can be sketchy, at the best of times. I know better than to think their lack of replies should affect my self-worth, but after it keeps happening on and off these apps, it really starts to make me wonder what am I doing wrong? I know some guys off apps (know to see them) that they are gay and I'm sure they know I am gay, but they never say hi. I never do either, but I always feel like they don't like me, or are awkward around me, so I stay away. I start to hate myself a little after a while. I think stuff like - am I ugly? Is it my personality that keeps men away? Even as far as to question if I am a bad person? To you reading this, that might sound ridiculous, but imagine being snubbed through various forms for years (or at least that's what it feels like) and maybe you can understand. Everyone else around me gets male attention no bother. Except my one gay best friend. He's the same age as me, but he's also never had a bf. I would love him to, obviously (and sometimes I find myself wondering should we get together, but I don't even think he's interested lol), but it is kinda nice to not be alone in it. He doesn't seem as tore up as me about it though, or maybe he has a better poker face? My girl friends all have bf's and I'm here still waiting for my first boyfriend, at 24.     

Some guys tell me that I am good looking, but yet I'm man-less. Both short *and* long term. My friends who I've known for over a decade (and some two!) tell me I'm a great guy and anyone would be lucky to have me as a bf, but again, I'm without a relationship.      

I can be shy, but only as shy as the next person approaching someone they like. It's nerve wracking. Anyway, enough of my ranting. I would love if someone would give me some advice. And if you need any more info, please ask. Sorry if I left stuff out that needed to be included. I don't usually open myself up so much and I'm a bit frazzled/not sure what to say/trying to edit it short.

So guys, I went through with it. It well well!!

Basically the guy came over and was really really really helpful. Like he gave me his keys and wallet as he walked in to put away, and he basically told me that he would only do whatever I told him to do. And that's what happened. I sucked his dick a little, he sucked me a little, and we jacked each other off, and it was friendly and nice and I'm really happy that it happened that way. 

Given the Grindr horror stories I think I lucked out, but basically it was fun and only went as far as I wanted it to go. And really, the guy I met who was a lot older than me was TOTALLY amazing and positive and helpful. Also gave me tips on getting stains out of the couch. :)

Thanks for your input, guys! I think I'll not be doing this again anytime soon, even though it was pretty worth it.

EDIT: The only downside might be that when I'm in the car with my parents, I'm just thinking ""holy hell there was a penis in my mouth 4 hours ago and now I'm running errands with my parents"". That was a weird feeling. Also, the fact that that one couch in the house is never going to look the same to me again.

I had PE with him in HS and he was the only guy in there that bothered to talk to me; we got on pretty well in that class.

The first time we hung out was because he invited me to a party at his place (which was weird bc I barely knew him then), but when I went I was the only person that showed. We chilled and talked about music and games and shit like that, but I got considerably drunk and asked to crash at his pad so he offered me his bed; I was too drunk to realize how rude it was to take him up on his offer so he slept on a pullout bed that night.

He said he'd try to remember, and the next day he told me he forgot the music at his place but he would just give me a flash drive with his entire iTunes library and I should swing by his house whenever to pick it up. Well I didn't want to seem like an eager bastard so I waited about 4 days and then asked if I could come snatch it from him. When I got there it was clear he hadn't showered all day (which of course is a sign that he could give a shit less about looks around me) because he had this rlly cute bedhead thing goin on and just idk am I nuts for even considering him as a potential shag or wtf?
