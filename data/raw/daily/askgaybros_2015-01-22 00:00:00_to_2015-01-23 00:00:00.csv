I feel like this would be a cookie cutter submission to this reddit but I kind of feel like I need someone to tell me their perspective on my situation.

I have been in limbo for about.... 4 years? I'm 22, from Australia and I am having a hard time telling people that i'm gay. I have no worries about not being accepted by my family. I have told my brother and most of my close friends and there is no problem there. I just keep holding back from breaking it to my parents. I feel like i'm just doing what's comfortable at the detriment to my development as a person. I'm pretty sure they already know, they're the type of people that are non confrontational so they won't bring it up, they do occasionally suggest I get with a few of my mostly women friends (though i kind of think they're using that to try to stimulate the gay conversation). I have plenty of gay people in my family and none are super religious or conservative so that isn't holding me back, I just feel like if I tell people i'm exposing a potential vulnerability in myself which is not what I present myself to be. 

The other part of me, while wanting to tell at least my parents, feels like i shouldn't have to tell people because this isn't really a big deal anymore? I'm pretty sure I have just used this kind of thinking in the past as a coping mechanism but I want to believe that this is the case.

Many of my friends and people I know have come out a few years ago and most of them know i'm gay but I feel like i've sort of missed the boat in a way. 

I feel like i'm being ridiculous but I also feel like I need some input as to what people like me would do in my situation. I know that many others have it much much harder than me so I think i'm being a bit petty but from my perspective this is a major thing for me.

I thank you guys for reading :) (I realise I said feel at least twenty times in this submission haha)

This was the reason a [r/gaysian](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaysian/comments/2t08oe/have_you_ever_dated_a_fob/) bro gave for dating someone just before he moves away to college, even though he felt he was incompatible with.

Fair enough, he had some complaints about the bf being cheap; language barriers; and bf having traditional family values and wanting children.


But there is so much expectation of the non-English speaking person to integrate and adjust to life. And many of the comments read as if the English speaker was superior and didn't need to change whatsoever. (It's probably just my mind-voice reading of it though.)


I'm just reflecting on myself, hoping I'm not as ... oblivious?


Me:  I'm Aus-Chinese. I met my partner whilst living in Vietnam. He's not macho. But a very good man. I always knew where I stood with him. I certainly never felt like I needed to be pushed to integrate into Vietnamese society. And I definitely knew I wasn't just there to prevent him from being single. 


Sure cultural differences and other differences in opinion and values come up. By you negotiate that stuff and have a laugh about it when it comes up. Like he finds it embarrassing when I raise my arms up when crossing busy Vietnamese streets because I saw old ladies do it, and I thought it was safer that way.

New to this so if it's the wrong subreddit please point me in the right direction. Come here for advice from other gaybros.

Currently dating a dude (2 years), we have the same sense of humour, he's the most beautiful man I've ever seen, good body, nice penis, good prospects too, into real raunchy sex, a bit of a unicorn. But here's the clincher, multiple times during our relationship he's been caught on gay apps and using snapchat etc. Last time I had enough, broke up with him.

He came crawling back, jumped through every hoop to be with me (I asked for a business proposition as to why he's not a bad investment - I am an engineer it sounds cold but it's the way I think - He came by with all my favourite foods - He drew me art of why we should be together - Sketched cute comicbook scenes of our most memorable moments). I told him since he's not really been single before (at 24 and most of the time been in relationships) if he wants to do this sort of thing, we need to negotiate it, and I may be open to it, but we can't lie to each other. We ruled out an open relationship because we both are afraid of losing each other.

He has always wanted to spend almost every minute he can with me (sometimes it's suffocating even). We've talked about starting a family, having a business together (We're in the same field, was his idea as his parents did it), and even pets (we bought our first together), he's met my family and they all get along, I've met his mother and she seemed to like me (he introduced us), she invited me over once but I was busy.

He's gone on a family vacation in Europe where his parents go to seminars so he's left alone for a while. He's downloaded grindr and got a reasonably raunchy (for grindr) pic of himself up and a small amount of text that I'm not sure if he's just chatting or more. (I have a GPS modifier).

I want to know: 
1. What's going on in his head. 
2. Is it worth staying is he ever going to change? 
3. From the way I talk does it sound like I'm doing anything wrong in the way I'm approaching him etc. (lay it on me, I'd rather know and improve than be causing this situation) 
4. Can I ever trust him?
I know this is such a deluded line but: Other than the lies we seem literally perfect for each other.


tl;dr: Boyfriend seems to be addicted to chat apps and sending nudes, straight up 10/10 guy though, and does things to show that he loves me. Whatdo? Is it all an illusion, or is he just really weak? Is the situation salvageable?


I would especially like, if possible someone who's done the same thing as him to reply. I don't want to judge, just understand.

Thanks.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Guys,&lt;/p&gt;

My situation is so ridiculous that I just need to laugh about it (or at least try to). In advance, I apologize for a major text chunk, but I just need to get it off my chest and vent.

For a bit of background, I would still consider myself fairly new to seeing guys. I identify as kinda bisexual, but it has taken me a while to even just get there, and for now, I've seen almost exclusively guys. Close friends know about my habits, family members not so much (you try figuring out what to say to immigrant parents). Pretty much in the years after I graduated college, my life was a series of hookups, and many were fun, I can't even lie. But in recent years, I've decided that I wanted to be a bit more intentional in what I am looking for and try for actual dates.

What haven't I tried for finding dates... Grindr, Tinder, okcupid, Plenty of Fish, Match... and to be honest, I've had a fair number of dates. Some were only just the one, and that's okay. But then I've had others that were more. These ""others"" turned into second and third dates, and usually fairly regular texting. Okay, great. But then, a lot of them just *drop off*, no explanation given, hence going ghost. This has happened more times than I want to admit. Now, if I have to be completely honest about myself, I know that I have a tendency to text a lot, and I know I develop feelings quickly too. Not necessarily ""let's be exclusive"", but definitely above just a one time thing. And hey, I can be a pretty sensitive and caring person (not trying to sound cliche, I can just identify that in myself). I figure both of these things might have a lot to do with why guys disappear on me, but it doesn't make it any easier. Pardon my profanity, but sometimes I wish guys would fucking man up and be honest and just tell me if they aren't interested. And in identifying this in myself, yes, I am trying to be more aware of it and chill out a bit more if I am talking to a guy seriously!

Now, why do I still bring this up now? My most recent ghost is one that hurts in particular. Met him on Grindr, we went on quite a few dates, I even spent the night at his place once. Super educated, really sweet, and seemingly into me as well, and aside from all that, I even *told* him about my bad luck with guys in the past. And now all of a sudden, no text response. Nothing. My birthday is even this Saturday, so that makes it awesome...

So, my two questions that I want to resolve...
1. I know this last guy probably won't respond, but I feel like I just need to tell him how awful he's made me feel. Should I say anything? And if I should, how should I even say it?
2. Knowing what I know about myself, how can I help improve myself? And on that, what are different ways I can meet guys? Again, I'm still new to all this... I'm definitely not desperate, but as I approach 27, it would be awesome if I could have a special someone to hang out with...

A lot of this probably doesn't make sense, but if you read this, props to you. I really needed to vent, above all else, and if I can get wise words from those more experienced than I, than so much the better. Thanks in advance, bros. (Also, fairly new to reddit so if I did something wrong, please bear with me and help me fix it!)

**So, update-** upon the advice from a couple of you, I decided to really send this last guy a straightforward text. Basically, it was along the lines of, I don't like being ignored and if you aren't interested then just tell me. He responded by saying he had been busy at work but he was sorry. And he even wished me a happy birthday, which was nice and surprising because I didn't remind him. Then after, we just continued texting, and he was texting like he used to before, which is also interesting because I just feel like he was tapering off before. So, I'm a tad conflicted- but only a tad. Part of me feels like I shouldn't take bullshit excuses. But, a larger part of me still likes him, and I feel like maybe he actually might care? I mean, he remembered that it was my birthday so...

Continued thoughts?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys, so for what it&amp;#39;s worth, the title is just to try to bring a bit of humor to my life. My situation is so ridiculous that I just need to laugh about it (or at least try to). In advance, I apologize for a major text chunk, but I just need to get it off my chest and vent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a bit of background, I would still consider myself fairly new to seeing guys. I identify as kinda bisexual, but it has taken me a while to even just get there, and for now, I&amp;#39;ve seen almost exclusively guys. Close friends know about my habits, family members not so much (you try figuring out what to say to immigrant parents). Pretty much in the years after I graduated college, my life was a series of hookups, and many were fun, I can&amp;#39;t even lie. But in recent years, I&amp;#39;ve decided that I wanted to be a bit more intentional in what I am looking for and try for actual dates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What haven&amp;#39;t I tried for finding dates... Grindr, Tinder, okcupid, Plenty of Fish, Match... and to be honest, I&amp;#39;ve had a fair number of dates. Some were only just the one, and that&amp;#39;s okay. But then I&amp;#39;ve had others that were more. These &amp;quot;others&amp;quot; turned into second and third dates, and usually fairly regular texting. Okay, great. But then, a lot of them just &lt;em&gt;drop off&lt;/em&gt;, no explanation given, hence going ghost. This has happened more times than I want to admit. Now, if I have to be completely honest about myself, I know that I have a tendency to text a lot, and I know I develop feelings quickly too. Not necessarily &amp;quot;let&amp;#39;s be exclusive&amp;quot;, but definitely above just a one time thing. And hey, I can be a pretty sensitive and caring person (not trying to sound cliche, I can just identify that in myself). I figure both of these things might have a lot to do with why guys disappear on me, but it doesn&amp;#39;t make it any easier. Pardon my profanity, but sometimes I wish guys would fucking man up and be honest and just tell me if they aren&amp;#39;t interested. And in identifying this in myself, yes, I am trying to be more aware of it and chill out a bit more if I am talking to a guy seriously!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, why do I still bring this up now? My most recent ghost is one that hurts in particular. Met him on Grindr, we went on quite a few dates, I even spent the night at his place once. Super educated, really sweet, and seemingly into me as well, and aside from all that, I even &lt;em&gt;told&lt;/em&gt; him about my bad luck with guys in the past. And now all of a sudden, no text response. Nothing. My birthday is even this Saturday, so that makes it awesome...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, my two questions that I want to resolve...
1. I know this last guy probably won&amp;#39;t respond, but I feel like I just need to tell him how awful he&amp;#39;s made me feel. Should I say anything? And if I should, how should I even say it?
2. Knowing what I know about myself, how can I help improve myself? And on that, what are different ways I can meet guys? Again, I&amp;#39;m still new to all this... I&amp;#39;m definitely not desperate, but as I approach 27, it would be awesome if I could have a special someone to hang out with...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of this probably doesn&amp;#39;t make sense, but if you read this, props to you. I really needed to vent, above all else, and if I can get wise words from those more experienced than I, than so much the better. Thanks in advance, bros. (Also, fairly new to reddit so if I did something wrong, please bear with me and help me fix it!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, update-&lt;/strong&gt; upon the advice from a couple of you, I decided to really send this last guy a straightforward text. Basically, it was along the lines of, I don&amp;#39;t like being ignored and if you aren&amp;#39;t interested then just tell me. He responded by saying he had been busy at work but he was sorry. And he even wished me a happy birthday, which was nice and surprising because I didn&amp;#39;t remind him. Then after, we just continued texting, and he was texting like he used to before, which is also interesting because I just feel like he was tapering off before. So, I&amp;#39;m a tad conflicted- but only a tad. Part of me feels like I shouldn&amp;#39;t take bullshit excuses. But, a larger part of me still likes him, and I feel like maybe he actually might care? I mean, he remembered that it was my birthday so...&lt;/p&gt;

Guys, It's Time to Stop Shaving Your Junk

From the column 'Tubesteak'


There is nothing more disappointing than taking a new guy home for the first time and ripping his clothes off, only to find that he has ""manscaped"" himself to look like some sort of dude-shaped topiary. When I bring home a man I want to see a masculine wreath of pubes around his dick, not a shaved walrus. Tragically, it’s becoming harder and harder to find a guy whose chest stubble won't give you a rugburn or whose bare nut sack doesn’t look like a dismembered turkey waddle. Guys, this has to stop.

The social scientists over at Cosmopolitan recently published a study claiming that 95 percent of men now trim or shave their body hair in one way or another, a practice that has taken on the cringeworthy title of manscaping. I hate it and want it to die. Presumably, many other true lovers of the male form feel the same way. Body hair is one of the secondary sex characteristics of being a man, so why would anyone want to eradicate it altogether?

As much as it pains me to admit it, us gays are probably at fault. During the 90s, the gay aesthetic was dominated by the plucked and preened body builder look. This, of course, spread to advertising (remember the billboard of shirtless Marky Mark in his undies in Times Square?), which seeped into the minds of straight guys, which led to razor companies making products for guys who wanted to look like 14-year-old synchronized swimmers. There is also some aspect of female equality in this whole equation. As men began to demand that their ladies be as shiny under their clothes as Barbie dolls, women started expecting the same of their men.

Although shaving off all your pubes started as a gay thing, it’s now primarily straight guys who are doing it. John Marsh, the owner of gay porn site Fratmen, told the Daily Beast that the guys in his videos who get their Bic on south of the border are the straight models, not the gay ones. This has gone from being something that most guys thought of as sissy to something that is thought of as a prerequisite for getting pussy.

I'm here to tell you that it's stupid. Yes, a little bit of deforestation may make your junk look bigger, but, honestly, the only person who cares how big it looks is you, when it’s in your own hand and you're jerking it off. I'm not saying no one cares how big it is, but you're the only one who cares how big it looks.

As for the rest of a guy's body, there is no reason why you need to shave, trim, wax, pluck, or Nair for Men that shit. Yeah, you might want to get an overly furry back under control (no one wants to fuck  George the Animal Steele) but just let the rest of it wild. There is nothing so good as letting someone rub their hand through a Magnum PI-style pelt. If a lady or other sex partner doesn't like feeling a nice set of furry thighs rub up against them in the heat of the moment, then they aren't worth the time it took to trick them into your bedroom in the first place.

And unless you’re as buff as Mark Wahlberg, getting rid of all that fuzz will just make you look scrawnier, pastier, and sillier. The great thing about having a coat of hair is that it will cover up many imperfections. It's like having natural Photoshop for your body!

Even worse than how prepubescent shaving makes you look is that it makes you complacent in the corporate conspiracy to turn the way we look into a consumer commodity. As I already pointed out, the main reason this disgusting practice is encouraged is because there are now products to take care of it. Marketing is telling men to shed their Darwinian protection against the elements, and men, stupid sheep that we are, are listening. Stand up and fight! Put down that Philips Norelco BG2040/34 Bodygroom Pro Grooming System and pick up a bit of pride in your masculinity. After all, nothing is more manly than doing what is right, not giving a fuck about anyone else, and sticking it to the man (no matter how gay that sounds). 

Luckily the gays (and hirsute stars like Jake Gyllenhaal) are making the Sasquatch a thing of beauty once again. Manhunt, the gay cruising site that your uncle uses, recently did a study that proves most homosexuals who use the internet for quick dick prefer men in their natural states. This means it's only a matter of time before being au naturel is once again the norm. And I, for one, can't wait. I'd much rather pick a little man-floss out of my teeth after going down on a guy than have another goosefleshy nut sack in my face.

So, does this guy sound so weird?  I want to sleep with men, not dolphins.RSMSMK

I've been talking to this guy for a while via apps and texts and we met up several times for coffee and the like. We've known each other for a small while, about two weeks. He's moving away in another few weeks so I told myself not to let myself get too attached. But at this point I don't think I'll have to worry about that anymore.

The other day we decided to have some fun times because the attraction is there and we're both receptive to it. Well, I let him know that I've never been bottom before (top multiple times, so I'm not a virgin, either). Well, he's very much into the idea of being the top, so I agree.

We go to the drug store and get lube and condoms, and we take it back to his place. Where we promptly get to business. So we're teasing each other and he's prepping for some work with his fingers and lube. And this is where I should have just stopped it altogether, because he pressed himself against me with his lubed,  uncovered, dick.

And I'm sorta shaking right now just typing it.

Anyway, I told him to stop and that he's not gonna get inside me without a condom on. ""Oh I'm just messing around"". At this point he does stop and gets a condom on. But if I hadn't told him to stop, his head was right at my ring....

So it gets worse.

We're fucking (It's really not too pleasant, I'm not sure if I like being bottom), and he stops for a moment and says ""Sorry, I'm losing hardness"". (It's dark, I can't really see, anyway.) I told him it's fine and that we can stop. Well he said he wants to continue, just a moment to get some more lube and a refresher on his dick...

Well at this point I very highly suspect that he has removed the condom. I couldn't tell the difference and at the time, I didn't know any better. I was thinking too much with the head of my penis. Well, even so, thank GOD he had the courtesy of pulling out before finishing. That was also the biggest indicator that he had pulled the condom off. That he pulled out and was quick to release on the floor or mattress or whatever. I jerked off and left after that.

It was maybe later in the night or the next morning that I realized he had done this. I'm almost completely certain he did and I just absolutely do not want to talk to him at all. I'm spewing in anger right now and I'm conflicted with my emotions. I doubt I got HIV from this encounter but it's an extremely fucked up situation and I don't really know how to handle it, emotionally.

I plan on going to the clinic soon, but I know I won't get any info on my HIV status for a while. I heard 6 - 8 weeks before it shows up at all.

Can I just get some knowledge that I'm not alone in this... maybe it's happened to some of you guys? Are you still resentful? I just want advice on getting emotionally past it.

It's done, it's in the past. But FUCK it if I'm not mad as hell at everything.


I guess tl;dr: Bottomed for a guy, he pulled off condom halfway through. Pissed off about it.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throwaway for reasons...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been talking to this guy for a while via apps and texts and we met up several times for coffee and the like. We&amp;#39;ve known each other for a small while, about two weeks. He&amp;#39;s moving away in another few weeks so I told myself not to let myself get too attached. But at this point I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ll have to worry about that anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other day we decided to have some fun times because the attraction is there and we&amp;#39;re both receptive to it. Well, I let him know that I&amp;#39;ve never been bottom before (top multiple times, so I&amp;#39;m not a virgin, either). Well, he&amp;#39;s very much into the idea of being the top, so I agree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We go to the drug store and get lube and condoms, and we take it back to his place. Where we promptly get to business. So we&amp;#39;re teasing each other and he&amp;#39;s prepping for some work with his fingers and lube. And this is where I should have just stopped it altogether, because he pressed himself against me with his lubed,  uncovered, dick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;#39;m sorta shaking right now just typing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I told him to stop and that he&amp;#39;s not gonna get inside me without a condom on. &amp;quot;Oh I&amp;#39;m just messing around&amp;quot;. At this point he does stop and gets a condom on. But if I hadn&amp;#39;t told him to stop, his head was right at my ring....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it gets worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re fucking (It&amp;#39;s really not too pleasant, I&amp;#39;m not sure if I like being bottom), and he stops for a moment and says &amp;quot;Sorry, I&amp;#39;m losing hardness&amp;quot;. (It&amp;#39;s dark, I can&amp;#39;t really see, anyway.) I told him it&amp;#39;s fine and that we can stop. Well he said he wants to continue, just a moment to get some more lube and a refresher on his dick...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well at this point I very highly suspect that he has removed the condom. I couldn&amp;#39;t tell the difference and at the time, I didn&amp;#39;t know any better. I was thinking too much with the head of my penis. Well, even so, thank GOD he had the courtesy of pulling out before finishing. That was also the biggest indicator that he had pulled the condom off. That he pulled out and was quick to release on the floor or mattress or whatever. I jerked off and left after that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was maybe later in the night or the next morning that I realized he had done this. I&amp;#39;m almost completely certain he did and I just absolutely do not want to talk to him at all. I&amp;#39;m spewing in anger right now and I&amp;#39;m conflicted with my emotions. I doubt I got HIV from this encounter but it&amp;#39;s an extremely fucked up situation and I don&amp;#39;t really know how to handle it, emotionally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan on going to the clinic soon, but I know I won&amp;#39;t get any info on my HIV status for a while. I heard 6 - 8 weeks before it shows up at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can I just get some knowledge that I&amp;#39;m not alone in this... maybe it&amp;#39;s happened to some of you guys? Are you still resentful? I just want advice on getting emotionally past it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s done, it&amp;#39;s in the past. But FUCK it if I&amp;#39;m not mad as hell at everything.&lt;/p&gt;

I guess that's progress.

Apartment search is ongoing - both for a bachelor and a 2-bedroom apartment.  The apartment question has dominated most conversations since the breakup both between each other and with friends / parents.  While opinions are mixed, the people that I feel know us best are fairly supportive of us getting a 2-bedroom.  We've lived together before during and after a breakup and things were fine.  Now, yes, arguably, we did get back together repeatedly after breaking up, but we've done this often enough that I can say with scientific certainty that proximity doesn't really play a role in whether or not we're going to recombine.

My emotions are still a little up and down.  I think I've moved fully into the Acceptance stage now, but there are little things that set me off like the episode of Friends we were watching with dinner last night.  Monica was stoked to be an aunt and I realized ""I'll never get to hang out with his niece and nephew again."" I teared up, I sniffled, but when my ex asked if I was alright, I was able to recover just fine.

We're still trading between the couch and the bed, but in the past two nights both of us have moved from the couch back to the bed.  We're not quite used to sleeping alone yet I think, but that'll come with time.

Speaking of which, I have friends heading out of town for a few days and they offered to let me stay at their apartment, so I'll be getting out of here for a bit and living apart.  The distance is going to be good for both of us I think and since they are mutual friends, we've worked out a kind of schedule so that we can both have time away at this other apartment while we continue to look for a new place.

We haven't told most of our family and friends yet - though both of our mothers wanted to know when we were moving back to Ontario *eye roll* - and I'm really dreading having to change my Facebook status.  I find that to be a really ridiculous thing to have to worry over and deal with, and not because I'm caught up on keeping the ""engaged"" status - I just don't want to have to deal with all the ""OMG what happened?!?!"" posts -.-

tl;dr: We're doing okay.  I may have a stomach bug.  I'm getting my own space for a month while we sort out the final details.
