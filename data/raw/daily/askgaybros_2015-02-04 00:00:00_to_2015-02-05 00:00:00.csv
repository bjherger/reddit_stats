We both go to the same college, and have part time jobs. We don't really give each other gifts for no reason, usually just for Christmas or birthdays. Despite that, I have high regard for it since I see it as a way of appreciating your SO.

This Christmas I made sure to get him a nice sweater, expensive underwear and capacitive gloves since he was going on a trip with family. He said he didn't get me anything because he wanted to get me something really nice during his trip, like leather shoes, snowglobes, or something exotic he said. I thought alright.

Well, when he came back and at first he just gave me a scarf. I thought it was kind of thoughtless, and simple. Like there's nothing special about a scarf. He said there was also a shirt, but he couldn't find it at first. It was a nice shirt, but it's too small so I don't think I'm going to wear it. I talked with him on how I felt and he said he was getting me something more anyway, I told him he didn't really have to. I just wanted to tell him how I felt.

Well, I got it yesterday and at first I thought it was really nice and felt really guilty since I pretty much asked for it. It was a G-shock watch, similar to one I had given him for him birthday. However, once I looked closer I realized it was a knock off. It says ""S-Shock"" lol, curiously, I looked it up and it was only like $10. I feel for him, but now I feel even guiltier since I asked for it, and I kind of don't feel like wearing it in public, just because it's so obvious too. I love him, but I still feel kind of shortchanged in regards to getting special things. 

I know I probably sound like a huge bitch about it, I haven't said anything. I might not, but I can't help feeling like this. 

I know I should drop it was just wear it anyway, but I'm not sure how to deal with it. Any feedback?

But:
I'm a 13-yo girl. I have a friend group of 4 girls and 2 guys, and I'm closer to one of the guys than the other. Let's call him 'Dylan'. 
So it's freshman year. I've known these people for 5-ish years. Dylan and the other guy in the group, 'Jerry', always seemed slightly more feminine. They don't really have any close guy friends except for each other. Dylan, just this year, got a schedule really close to mine, so I've been spending more time with him. A month or two ago, I got this little suspicion he maybe likes me... He always is mimicking me (in a playful way) and pokes me (playfully). He talks to me a lot and looks at me a lot too, but I do realize that this might just be his personality. 
Me and the girls, I think, have always had our suspicions. I haven't really met any gay people I guess (not sheltered, just keep to myself more), and I really am getting sick of wondering if he's flirting with me or just being my good (gay?) friend. 
So, here's my question to you: is it okay to ask? I always assumed it wasn't, but society surprises me sometimes. Are there any little things to look for that might help me decipher his behavior, also?

Is any of this attractive to men? And if so, how the hell do I find them? I don't know what's attractive to men, I don't know how to act sexy, what's a hot thing to do or say in bed, etc. I don't know how to bottom, or how to find a top. 

What I do know is that I am a bit fascinated by penises. I really want to touch someone else's. I spend a lot of time wondering what they taste like and if you can tell when someone is cumming in you, or what THAT even tastes like. I spend a fair amount of time masturbating over being a bottom for someone. 

I feel bad about it. I'm not interested in romance, I'm not even really interested in their personality. I don't find men all that attractive in general, but I find the idea of being with one kinda hot. But I am not super interested in talking (unless it's during GO time) I would rather be blindfolded or it happen in a dark room anyway, and mostly I just want to use someone for sex. I feel guilty about it, like I'm reducing other men to sex objects; but that's kind of how I'd like to be treated once (just to try it!) for myself. I have plenty, and some fairly detailed, fantasies. But I don’t want to bore you with those. 

How do I go about finding someone who shares a similiar fantasy? Do men who like to top still find other masculine men attractive even if they want to be on the bottom or treated in a less than masculine fashion? Do I need to shave all of my body hair? (I know, dumb question.) I also feel like I need to make it clear that it’s probably going to be a one time thing. 

I really just have no idea what I am doing. I don't want to insult anyone and I feel like all of my questions are mostly asked out of complete ignorance, so I apologize for that. But as someone who has only dated women, I am not really sure what I am doing.

I'm not sure if this is the place to post this but I'm not sure what else to do. It's a long post and a bit of a sob story, apologies in advance. Also I'm writing this on my phone so the formatting might not be pretty.

Over the past month or two I became very close to a guy named Freddy. We would text all day every day. A few days after New Years we were talking and he told me about how he was recovering from leukemia. He said that the few guys that he has gotten close to and told them about his condition, ended up becoming distant from him almost immediately . After that we only got closer and later even officially becoming boyfriends.

About a week later he got re diagnosed with cancer. It was much worse than the first time he had it. He was in and out of the hospital more often than before, he had to drop out of school, some days he wasn't even strong enough to hold his phone to text. 

This weekend I was out of state for a school trip. On Saturday evening I was talking with him. He said he wasn't feeling too good and he called 911. I didn't hear from him till later the next day. I was so relieved when I got a text from him because I thought he might have passed. We talked on the phone a little after he had texted me about what happened after he called 911. He wasn't allowed to leave the hospital. The call only lasted around 5 minutes because the doctors didn't want him on the phone. That phone call was the last time I told him I loved him. We texted a little bit more until around 10 that night. He stopped responding to my texts. I just assumed that he fell asleep because of his medication because that wasn't so uncommon the weeks before. Usually he would give me a heads up when he was gonna take his meds but I just wrote it off. 

The next morning (yesterday) I woke up to a text from an unknown number. It was Freddy's brother, Hunter. Freddy had fallen into a coma. Things were not looking good for him. His brother said he would keep me up to date and text/call me after him and his siblings went to visit Freddy in the hospital. I didn't hear back from Hunter until around 10 pm.

Hunter had no good news about Freddy. His organs had started to fail and the doctors did all they could. They were able to resuscitate him twice but he wasn't able to make it. He was pronounced dead at 3:16 in the afternoon.

I just got back from my school trip this afternoon. I was crying the whole ride back. I've told my parents and some friends. I don't know what to do right now. I don't know how to deal with the emptiness I feel.

So, there's this guy I sit next to in Art class.  In this class I'am with him in, there's only eight people total, so it's not a crowded class.  It's a high school class btw.  I talk to him throughout the class period.  He's straight, has a girlfriend (this isn't another ""I love a straight guy, what do I do?"" thread, so bear with me).  There's something that's been going on in the last couple weeks, that's putting some hot fire between us.  The thing is, he's saying ""why won't you just come out?"".  He's gets kinda mad if I just say ""Idk"".  I mean, I never say anything to say I'm gay, but it's like he knows and he's mad and kinda pissed that I just won't admit it.  Like, I know he's not a homophobe.  I do believe he's an open guy.  But, here's the thing.  We have another gay student in class and he's open about it.  The thing is, a different kid in the class makes really homophobic slurs to him, and that's what I kinda fear if I open up.  I mean, when I see the gay student being called out, I just see him as me if I came out to the guy I was talking about in the first place that I talk to a lot everyday.  

So, today... I mean, he's always making joke question like ""have I tasted pussy"".  My crap instict was to say ""yes"", even though it wasn't true.  He just said right after ""why are you lying?  You don't have to lie.. it's ok if you're a virgin"".  His tone wasn't that of making fun of me, but in a way that he was geniune.  It's kinda hard to explain, but he wasn't making fun of me.  Of course, I dragged the dead horse and stood by lie.  I don't know... I just thought being a virgin in senior year would be laughed at, but I'm really not.. just didn't lose it to a woman.  So I mean, I have mixed emotions how to process this.  I think he's trying to get me to be honest, and I hate to be that guy who lies to look cool.  I'm just tired of it... Do you think I could tell him?  If so, how?  Thank you..


**Edit:** Also wanted to say today he asked me if I wanted to marry someday.  I said yes, and he said to who.  I said a woman... so, it was silence for a moment, and he just said ""whatever floats your boat man, don't let anyone get in your way of loving someone"" or to that affect.

Sorry this is a really boring question but I don't know where else to ask. 

Husband and I just moved to Contra Costa County, California and we have Kaiser insurance through my work. 

Does anybody know which of the Kaiser docs in the East Bay are gay friendly? I figure there can't be a lot of doctors in the Bay Area that are homophobic... but I had a homophobic doctor back in the day in Seattle and it was horrible. So I'm looking to avoid repeating the experience. 

Not opposed to BARTing into San Francisco if you know a good Kaiser doc there, but all things being equal I'd love to stay on my side of the pond: Oakland or Richmond.  

Again, sorry for the boring question, but if you have a Kaiser doctor in the Bay Area you recommend, please PM me or comment. 

Thanks a bunch.

Also, throwaway, for personal reasons.

Okay, so the other month, I came out to my best friend, who we'll call Jake. He was awesome about it &lt;3 Yay! He has a girlfriend (We'll call her Anna) who he told and she instantly wanted to start hooking me up with guys.

So, this is awesome! Probably more than I could ask for at this point because just being accepted is enough for me haha.

Anyway, so Anna messages me one day asking weather I was interested in a particular guy (Let's call him Tom)... I had met him before before we were both out and I had no idea that he was gay. She sent me pictures and stuff and I agreed to talk to him over Facebook.

So I get talking and he is super cute like really really cute. He shares common interests with me and we are happily talking! It's his birthday when we were talking as well so that may have influenced some of the things that I said (Compliments etc.).

So a few days pass and he doesn't respond to any of my messages... a bit odd but oh well. And that's when Jake calls. He calls me and tells me to delete Tom instantly and never talk to him again. A bit strange, so I ask him why.

He then tells me that Tom had gone over to Anna's house, uninvited, and shoved his tongue down her throat. He fingered her, and really scared her. She ended up running and locking herself in the bathroom until he left, texting Jake about it.

Tom then starts messaging me. But in a really casual way, you know? 'Hey man, how are you?', 'How was your day?'.

So now, I start messaging Anna asking if she's okay. She repeats what Jake says about Tom and I comfort her.

I meet up with Jake and Anna a few times after the incident and they just keep repeating their disgust and hatred for Tom.


And now, a few months later, Tom has started messaging me again. In again, the casual kind of small talk.

Anna has been recently expressing her sympathy for him, because he has been apologizing non stop since the incident.

What should I do? Sorry for the ramble, I'm a bit tired at the moment... Thanks for the help guys &lt;3
