I consider myself a bottom, because A) it feels incredible to me, and B) mentally, the thought of being penetrated and being the object of another guys pleasure totally does it for me.

My guy is totally vers, which we talked about early on.  I asked him if he'd be comfortable being with someone who considers themselves a bottom, and he said yes.  I told him I'd be open to experimenting and changing things up with him but he assured me that wouldn't be necessary.  We ran into some problems right off the bat in bed, with him having severe anxiety and not being able to stay hard.  We worked past it though, and in certain positions he's able to pound away.

As our relationship progressed I learned a little more about his past sexual relationships, and he told me that he'd mostly bottomed in all his past encounters.    I told him again that I'd be willing to try with him, and he said he wants to at some point but that he's really tight and is nervous because of my size.

The other day we were fooling around and he pulled out a butt plug and asked if I wanted to try something different.  I was all for it, and just like that he slid the buttplug in.  I could tell right away that he was loving it, and his orgasm was much more intense.  It didn't strike me as unappealing, but I wasn't super turned on either....however I got off with no problem.  Afterwards he kept asking me if it was weird for me, and I asked why he was so concerned...and he said that he doesn't want me to see him as a ""bottom begging to be fucked"".  I told him that if thats what he wants then I can't change that and that he shouldn't be so concerned with the image he projects.  He told me he wants to be my ""big top guy"".  I told him that he shouldn't deny himself of what he wants because of a fear of how he's going to look to me.

HERE'S THE PROBLEM:  I want to be able to top him, and give it to him, but my view of him actually IS changing...and I'm afraid it's going to effect my abilities.  The fact that he's trying to project this image of a big top guy bothers me, because I don't want someone trying to be something they might not necessarily be.  I wish it didn't effect me, but it does - I think I'm just sexually attracted to a guy that wants to top me as opposed to a guy that wants to bottom for me.

So what the hell do I do?  I don't want to say ""hey, if you bottom I might lose my erection and not be into it sexually"" but I also don't want to close him off to what he wants.

This post possibly didn't make any sense at all but...help me?

So earlier this afternoon,I was working out my back on a machine,and so was he on a machine
next to mine.He was done with the machine he was occupying and he approached me and asked if I mind if we work  in together. I gathered up all my nerve and tried to chat him up. He was surprisingly receptive and
chatted me back considering he rarely talks to anyone in the gym.When he started talking,he had 
an Eastern European accent,found out he was from Poland. After that I asked him about his diet and
routine and we chatted from there. He smiled at me when he caught me looking at him later on during

&lt;p&gt;So earlier this afternoon,I was working out my back on a machine,and so was he on a machine
next to mine.He was done with the machine he was occupying and he approached me and asked if I mind if we work  in together. I gathered up all my nerve and tried to chat him up. He was surprisingly receptive and
chatted me back considering he rarely talks to anyone in the gym.When he started talking,he had 
an Eastern European accent,found out he was from Poland. After that I asked him about his diet and
routine and we chatted from there. He smiled at me when he caught me looking at him later on during
the work out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do I take it from here. I haven&amp;#39;t asked for his age,but I think he&amp;#39;s 20-24 years old. I&amp;#39;m 19.&lt;/p&gt;

We're enjoying ourselves together and care about each other a lot. He is still friends with a few of his Ex's and I don't have a problem with that. 

One of his exes (who he dates for over a month only) kept texting him a lot and asking him out for drinks.  I naturally told him how I felt, he did not take it easy and thought I was acting crazy. But at the end he told the guy and stopped communication with him. And this happened about a 1.5 months ago. 

Fast forward to today, I use my bf phone for some apps that aren't available on my phone. Tonight I unlocked his phone and it was on a conversation with another Ex of his, lets call him F (they dated for 3 months about 3 years ago, and still good friend with each other). I knew this and I'm still ok with it. Anyways the conversation that I unlocked the phone to was the F telling my BF that he misses him. My bf said that he misses him as well. Then the F said that's good to hear. 

I have a strange/confused feeling about this and I don't know what to do. 

You should know that I'll be leaving the country for 3 months this June, and during that period my BF is staying with this F for a week while he's taking a class in the F's town.

My BF and i stayed with F once so it's not unusual for my BF to stay with F but I'm worried now. 

Rant over/ Sorry for the long post.

Several months ago I met a straight guy who's a lot of fun to be around. He is an amazing guy in my eyes, and definitely the type of guy I would date if it were an option. There is some attraction on my side, and he knows it, but he isn't bothered by it and I keep it in check. Occasionally I will make a joke of sorts alluding to my attraction to him, but he just laughs it off, no problem. 

Whenever we go out, hang out, or whatever, for lack of a better term, I spoil him. He doesn't pay for food, he sees something he wants, I buy it for him, money is never an issue. I don't do this because I'm attracted to him, I suppose you could say that my insecurities get the best of me and I want him to know how amazing I think he is and want him to always be happy, and I feel like I constantly have to show him and praise him, which I do (this is an internal struggle, he isn't demanding at all). And he's usually flattered by it.

So I went to visit him this weekend, and when I left, I completely forgot that I had promised to take him to Starbucks, which he loves. So this morning I sent him an e-card so he could go, and made a joke about spoiling him, and that I missed him already.  Usually he will text me every day and we just kinda chat about random stuff, but today I didn't get much. I knew he had a job interview today, so I figured he was busy with that. I asked him to keep me posted on how it went, but I never heard from him. I tried sending another message and got nothing. I figured I must have done something wrong, so I sent him one final message asking if everything was alright, I hadn't heard from him today and I hope I didn't do something to upset him.

About a half hour later he blows up my phone upset and disgusted about the message on the card I sent, saying I'm not his girlfriend, and that he's not obligated in any way to message me ever, and when I tried to diffuse the issue, he sent me 'TL;DR'.

Everything I do for him comes from a good place. Do I wish I had a chance? Absolutely, but I don't. And I'm cool just being a friend. I think very highly of him and never shy away from paying him a compliment and letting him know that I think he's awesome. It's all platonic love for him, nothing more. But what I said on the card was completely misread, and he won't hear me out. When I leave from visiting him, I miss him.  And I've told him this before and it wasn't an issue then. The 'spoiling' was a joke. I've never minded paying for anything, and I always insist. He's never asked me for a thing.  And when I left everything seemed okay, and we chatted after I got home a few hours later, but the card seems to be the catalyst in what happened.  As for the texting, I've gotten so used to hearing from him every day, and today was brutal at work so hearing from him would've cheered me up.

Did I do something wrong here? And how do I remedy this? I don't want to lose a great guy in my life over something so silly.  :(

EDIT: Thank you all for the responses, they've really helped me gain a different perspective of the situation.  My attraction to him has been nothing but that, and my understanding and acceptance that nothing will ever come of it is what has permitted us to remain friends.  I can't do anything about it, and I get that. It doesn't get me down, eitherr, it is what it is.   In fact, I encourage him to talk to girls when he sees someone he likes, and give him my honest opinion of the ones he points out. Meanwhile, I still put myself out there in hopes of meeting a great guy.  In a lot of ways I see him as the younger brother I wish I had.  It's always been in my nature to be a caring individual and I love looking out for people that matter the most to me. So it's not just him, it's a handful of friends, but I'll say he's the one I feel I connect to the most, so maybe that's why I overdo it. 

In any case, at the moment he isn't speaking to me, so I'm giving him some distance. Hopefully he'll come back and I can at least explain a few things, and this'll all blow over.

Growing up I probably had 4 or 5 big crushes on guys in school, but never acted on them/ext. as I wasn't accepting of myself yet, none of them were out as gay, and I was pretty shy I guess. So yea nothing happened with that at all.
 
Well, recently (~5 years later) I added one of the guys on Facebook, thinking he was still pretty cute, and I guess there was still a bit of hope he might be interested in men. Added several people as I scrolled through 'people you may know', didn't think much of it.
 
Well, a few days later I run into him at work and we have a bit of small talk. He was with a girl, whom I presumed to be his girlfriend(wasn't), and he wasn't as attractive as heI remembered, so I kind of just got over it.
 
Well, surprise surprise the next day he hits me up on Facebook. Before long we are full on talking and flirting, snapchatting cute selfies, ext. Him definitely instigating it. Over the next couple days talked about our sexuality (him closet bi), preferences, ext. We agree that we should hang out sometime soon.
 
Then he just stops talking to me, going on 4 days. So here I am, old feelings that I'd buried a long time ago coming back out. I don't know if he lost interest, is putting me on a shelf to hmu when he's bored, or what. I sent a couple messages and a Snapchat since then, he's read them all just no response. Don't want to flood him with messages when he isn't responding.
 
I kind of just want to have the 'well, fuck you too' attitude, but I'm worried maybe he's just scared of his sexuality or something. (He doesn't have much experience, and he'd be my first)
 
Just seems like a huge asshole thing to do, since he hit ME up, definitely was the one to step up to flirting, ext. Then just stops taking with no reason. Wouldn't be that big of a deal, but come on.. schoolboy crush I thought was straight.

Here is the sitch:

We are at a party at a bar, boyfriend is off hanging out with some people outside. Little ginger dude comes up and starts laying on the flirts pretty hard. I am not interested, and it is over within a few minutes. Someone comes up to me a bit of time after and tells me it was my boyfriend's ex. I proceed to look for him again to whoop some ass (they had a very horrible breakup, mostly due to some shitty treatment of my boyfriend), but he is nowhere to be found (it was a big party, or he might have left).

Here is the sitch:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are at a party at a bar, boyfriend is off hanging out with some people outside. Little ginger dude comes up and starts laying on the flirts pretty hard. I am not interested, and it is over within a few minutes. Someone comes up to me a bit of time after and tells me it was my boyfriend&amp;#39;s ex. I proceed to look for him again to whoop some ass (they had a very horrible breakup, mostly due to some shitty treatment of my boyfriend), but he is nowhere to be found (it was a big party, or he might have left).&lt;/p&gt;

You've all been a gigantic help since day 1 and I don't think I could of really gotten this far with this side of me without this subreddit. You've been here for me and the answers you've had for my past questions and others have meant the world to me.

Today I face a new issue. Yes, I've had my first real breakup after 25 years. Now I've talked to guys before this current guy but that's all that was with others- just talking. Never done anything with them besides a date here or there. It always became pretty obvious when meeting these guys that they only had one thing in mind- sex. Now I'm not a prude nor am I judgemental so I always lay down the line what I'm about and it isn't just jumping down the pants of other guys- basically throwing the ball back in their corner of whether or not they wanted to continue.

So ofc a lot of flakes along the path but it never really got me down because I still have a lot of focus towards myself and my own happiness. So I'm at the bar one day and next thing you know, like a Disney movie, I meet Mr. Perfect. We hit it off immediately, and I mean immediately. Drinking, kissing, talking, talking, and talking. We laughed at the same things, we're just basically so alike!

Exchanged numbers and from that point on my phone was basically reduced to walkie-talkie because all I used it for was to communicate with him. We were so in sync about absolutely everything and for weeks we were honestly just having such a great yet realistic time together. He had been burned by guys before in his past and I was still a newbie to this whole thing so we made sure to keep everything completely honest and on the table between each other.

I sound like a random school girl but we really were into each other, and it got to the point where we started moving a little too fast in the physical department. I don't think neither of us expected to really be engaging in those activities so soon. 

Either way everything was going great until our last date in a bar. Sadly, I know a lot of people- gay guys included. So our trips to the bars were borderline awkward at moments. Of course I always made sure to let people know who he was and what he was to me but it was still awkward. On our way out I went towards the bathroom area and a guy I used to talk to tried to hug me. I immediately pushed him to the side and found myself having to tug away from his grasp. Returning to my guy he was definitely not amused by what he just saw and I just knew this was about to get messy.

He gave me a ride home, we kissed goodbye and a few hours later we're on the phone and he's telling me we should be friends and it's all going too fast. In my mind I feel I just screwed everything up because he must be assuming I want any other guy so I'm just a mess and I just stop responding to him.

We text again in the morning he tells me he didn't appreciate me just abandoning the conversation like that- we talked previously about keeping an open communication. I explain myself and so does he and after making a fool of myself once again I finally start to understand his point as I myself thought the relationship was going a little too fast and I'd like to get to know him more before just going all crazy over him.

We agree to be just friends say goodnight and called it a day. I made the decision waking up that I wasn't going to bother him with a goodmorning or anything that may seem like a gushy text message so I just woke up did my thing and went straight to work. Once again he was not amused with the fact I did not text him.

At this point I felt like I messed up AGAIN! In my head I'm really trying to make this work but my actions continuously come off as pushing him away. We argue basically throughout the entire night to the next day to where I made the silly mistake of saying I needed space- why I said it is beyond me.

He was taken aback and after a quick convo he basically agreed to the space. Ever since then our conversations have just eviscerated entirely. We could have casual conversations, I'd have to initiate them of course but anything pass that and he would not respond. So I finally just got fed up and only sent him a txt letting him know that I missed him. No response for 6 days. I texted him again today letting him know I won't give up on him and still no response.

So now I find myself at a crossroad. I've taken bullets from life before so I know what doesn't kill me makes me stronger but I find myself utterly confused with this one. Am I making a fool of myself by randomly messaging him? Is it time to move on or should I just give it some time?

This guy is just really different. He's made me want more out of my own life and he's just an all around great person going through issues just like me. It might sound cliche but I really feel we belong in each other's lives. Not even looking for a relationship on that level anymore I just want to at least be friends or something.

btw: I've already apologized and explained myself to him many times before. And we're both in our mid-20s.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the past year or so I&amp;#39;ve really been throwing myself into this lifestyle, while keeping my sanity and morales of course!

I gave two guys hand jobs freshman year and came two seconds after anal with one guy sophomore year (I was topping). I haven't done anything else and I'm just kind of...well, compared to most guys I know I am incredibly inexperienced. I am (obviously) not the kind to hookup...in part because of body insecurities but mostly because of past sexual abuse. I'd like to think that I could sleep with someone after a couple dates or, hell, even one date, but I don't see myself doing anonymous hookups any time soon although I desperately wish I was capable of them.  
  
So...sex is obviously an important part of a relationship and from what I gather bad sex means there is no second date or a relationship ends after that. Judging by the amount of replies to threads here that advise ending the relationship after one bad sexy times, I feel the pressure. But I'm assuming I'm gonna be bad at sex. I was told I'm an amazing kisser and God knows I have pent up sexual frustration, but I know a) I won't last long at first and b) getting better at sex (supposedly) takes time.  
  
I'm afraid of meeting a great guy and then blowing it because I suck in bed. I already have ""small dick"" (about 4"" and not thick) as a strike against me, so I know I need to compensate and really do well. But how am I supposed to do that? I don't think it's unfair of me to say I need to get to know someone after sexual abuse. I'm just not gonna be normal in that way and that's okay. It's not my fault.  
  
So...my question is this. Do I ""warn"" guys when things are getting hot and heavy or do I just go with it? I feel like a warning may be the best bet. Not only are his expectations suddenly lowered, but if I end up being good in bed then I can really surprise him and make a good impression. However, I've seen mixed messages from guys here about how ""warning"" a guy comes off as insecurity and is a turn-off. But if I don't warn a guy, I'm worried that if I'm bad in bed that it just ends there...if he has high expectations then I may not meet them and it's bye bye to me.

I've been a long time lurker, and now am a first time poster, hoping you can help me out. I met my boyfriend at a bar and we hit it off almost immediately… three weeks later, we decided to make it official. 

This guy is everything I could want in a partner; he's smart, loyal, outgoing, caring, driven and is very very handsome. I enjoy his company, and makes me feel like I am the luckiest guy in the world. He's the type of person who will drop everything and be with you if there's a something wrong, and I love that about him… There seems to be one problem though, the size of his penis…

We consider ourselves vers, but he bottoms mostly and I top mostly (our preference). The first night we had sex, he was bottoming and I was topping. We get to his place, getting undressed and then notice that he had a very very small penis. He wasn't hard at all, but we continued and the sex was good… I blamed it on the nerves, and just brushed it off…

Except, this has been the case in every sexual encounter we've had. He tried to top me, and had a very hard time keeping it up. I felt so guilty, so we just flipped and finished. He hasn't came in any of our sexual encounters… 

I don't know what to do, apart from the obvious and talk about it? We've been official for just over 2 months now, and my feelings for him grow day and day. He might be honestly be the one. SO, what is the best way to go about talking to him about it? I've refrained from making any comment about his size, because I know it'll hurt him and that is the last thing I would ever want to do… 

I really like this guy, and I don't want to say/do anything that would jeprodise what we have. So how do I go about talking to him about this without making him feel ashamed or embarrassed?

But im not sure if I even am gay or not. So I like girls in one aspect but I also feel morely attracted to guys. And I thought I should try to explore to see what might happen.

So about a month ago I got on tinder and I set my preference to find men and woman and a lot of people really stood out. I must say that I have not done anything sexual with either gender but I have had a girlfriend before.

Anyways so I found this guy on tinder. He's my age(we're both 19) and I thought he was rather cute. For a while I didn't know if he was interested in me, because he would take so long to write me back. We eventually shared phone numbers and last night we had finally met each other. And I must say, I think it went really well! I believe we did hit it off, after chatting in a restaurant for nearly 2 hours.

But I had gone on tinder to explore. And now that I have I feel even more confused then I was when I first started. He doesn't know I'm in the closet. I didn't know if I should have told him that or not. But he does know where I live. Morely because we live 1 street over. I'm kinda afraid of him showing up at my house and wanting to do something. Am I crazy? Is he crazy? Could he be a stalker? I feel like I could possibly be in a relationship with him. But I'm afraid I might not be able to.

He is nice, but I just can't come out. At least not right now. I live with my parents and my other sibling and if any of them knew what I truly was, I feel that I might lose everything I have with my family. I'm so afraid, and I feel like this was one giant mistake. 

The guy was nice, I mean we talked for two hours, he even paid for my food! (Even though I didn't eat much) I just don't know what I should do. Please I really need someone to talk to about this. I feel so alone here. Everyone around me is so into religion, and even though I feel like a Christian and that I believe in God. I just feel so alone on this.

I have this friend who I've been texting back and forth with regularly for over a year and a half now. He's straight and lives close by, so he's really just a friend. He isn't even a best friend but still because our communication is mostly text I feel comfortable sharing with him things I don't even share with my boyfriend or best friend.

One of the things I regularly text with him about is death. Mostly suicide. I have a really weird fascination with death, including my own death, other people's death, and suicide. Especially the last one. And no it's not a fascination with blood and gore or watching people die, just the thought of death itself and what it's like. I've struggled with very deep and lasting depression for a long time but it comes and goes in cycles. I also struggle with really intense suicidal feelings during these cycles, but right now I'm **not** in a cycle, I feel just fine or neutral and not depressed.

Then the other day someone killed themselves near my work. They jumped off the parking garage roof onto the ground below into the alleyway. I was not aware that there was easy access to the ""roof"" or I guess I never really saw or thought about it. Now I've been texting my friend saying how it's really tempting to go check it out and maybe take the plunge. I told him how this time I feel different about it, like curious but apathetic. It's really tempting to walk over there and just do it. I don't feel desperate, just ready (all of this I'm telling my friend)

Well... You guessed it... My boyfriend saw those texts and he completely freaked out. He hasn't really said much to me for the past few days. I don't know what to do. I don't know if I should say anything or ignore it or what....

I know someone from high school, ten years back, top of the class, good looking, athletic, etc. Had at least one girlfriend at that time who he is still friendly with. Throughout college and beyond I never noticed him being ""connected"" to any other girlfriends in social media, but some people are just not public about that kind of stuff so wouldn't read into that. Lately been following him on Instagram, there's a picture or two of him with a pretty girl, who very well might be his girlfriend, again just nothing else to go on even in the captions to confirm or deny that.

That said, on Instagram I've noticed he likes pics of more than a couple guys who are gay. Just recently he followed another one from his city, went through his pictures and liked a good 6 or 7 of them at once. Again, this is all completely circumstantial- maybe he just has some sort of social circle that has a good deal of gay guys in it. Yet it has me wondering 'what if'? 

So I want to ask- have there been guys who flew completely under your gaydar? Society has a confirmation bias that just assumes everyone is straight unless they are flamboyant or say otherwise, which makes it in turn harder 'notice' some people who might be quietly gay all along. Yet I hear gay guys brag out how finely tuned their gaydar is, they ""always know"" when meeting someone no matter how closeted. I'm not all that experienced in gay life however, so I am not all that confident in my own ideas. So have you had situations where you discovered someone you know, one way or other, that someone is or very well might be gay, that you had absolutely no idea for? Or conversely, has your gaydar been 100% up until this point and maybe there is really something to it? 

**tl;dr**- Have you known someone to fly completely under your gaydar? What were they like, what kept them from 'pinging', and (aside from a formal coming out) how did you discover that they weren't straight or as straight as you thought? This can probably get ambiguous when it comes to stories of straight guys experimenting once or twice, I more mean guys who are more substantively gay, (but those stories can be fun too!)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure there&amp;#39;s been a topic before like this but difficult to find, if so, so throwing it out there.

I am crazy nervous (because I love the job where I am currently) but am really excited for the new chapter in my life :) ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m pretty bored at work, and these are always fun to do :) &lt;/p&gt;

was having lunch today at a panera, and as I was throwing away my trash, there was this extremely attractive male nurse having lunch sitting by himself near the trash bin. Really wasn't sure if he was gay or not, either way, I would have liked to have started up a conversation with him (another part of me didn't want to bother him while he was enjoying his lunch)  As I was walking, I was racking my brain to think of anything to say, and my mind went blank and couldn't come up with anything, so I just continued walking to my car... 

Normally if I can spot something I can see the person in interested off the bat, I can carry on a good conversation about that, but this dude, had nothing I can spot and I don't know anything about nursing...sooo..Any tips on how to start a nice conversation with a stranger at lunch?  What would be the best ice breaker in your experience?

I'm considering two things to help myself have a more attractive asshole:  1) getting hemorrhoid surgery and 2) getting electrolysis hair removal on my ass crack.  Does anyone have experience with either of these things?

My asshole looks like a balloon knot from past hemorrhoids.  My bf jokes on me and calls it ""an outie"", kind of like innie vs outie belly buttons.  It is also sometime uncomfortable to have sex as a result.  The hemorrhoids are under control now with a good diet, but the outward appearance is still there, and I'm considering surgical options for what is primarily a cosmetic issue at this point.

Also, I kind of want to have my ass hair lasered off to improve the appearance back there.  I've had it waxed before and shaved before, and the regrowth process is a giant pain in the ass.

So, anyone have good advice for me?  Let me know!!!!!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;
