I'll give you a tl;dr though. This is also a copy and paste from /r/lgbtsex[1] cause I want to get other people's opinions on this.

**TL;DR: Bottomed for the first time and it was a lot of fun, but I didn't feel much physical pleasure during the sex.**

So for starters, I had never bottomed for someone before, but I had used my dildo plenty of times. With my dildo, it initially feels a bit uncomfortable but as it stretches me out it becomes incredible. This is why I really wanted to try bottoming because I figured it would be like my dildo, but I don't have to do the work haha.

Now while it was a little bit like that, I can't say it felt nearly as good my dildo. I mean, a penis is certainly much different than a dildo. For one, a penis is softer and he was uncut which feels way different than a harder dildo with no foreskin.

That being said, after a few minutes of him stretching me out a bit, we got to a point where he could bottom out pretty easily, which felt incredible. But it only felt incredible mentally, the feeling of surrender was wonderful (I'm a little submissive and he's a bit dominant).

And yet unlike my dildo, when he was going really hard and fast, it didn't feel like much. I figured it's because he was wearing a condom and maybe because of his foreskin? I really don't know what it was, but it certainly felt different haha.

Did anyone else experience this their first time? I really wanna see him again cause he was damn good, but maybe I should loosen up beforehand so that when we get to it I'll actually feel something? Haha. It's not like he was small either, he was pretty big so I really don't know what happened.

So I have this friend, I’ve known him for about 5 years now, originally through work and then later through just hanging out and having shared interests. So, as far as I am concerned, he’s as straight as an arrow because he had a prior relationship with a gf, where they eventually moved out together - lasted 2 or 3 years I’d say. At this point, we didn’t see much of each other, but after their breakup (I didn’t even find out that they broke up for almost a month) he moved back in with his parents, which is also much closer to my location. So over the past few months we’ve seen each other and hung out together many times more than before, doing typical guy stuff I’d say; partying, drinking, video games, etc.

Now generally speaking, I’m usually pretty decent at deciphering the mixed signals that come out of a “not-out-identify-as-straight-used-to-have-a-gf-type” and also just for guys in general. Its a rare world out there but its pretty obvious when the only guy in a group is checking out nothing other than the guy across the street...(lol). So basically, I can’t decipher this friend of mine’s signals.. It feels as if he wants to the make the first move - but then backs off, in hopes I’ll make the first move, which I don’t, because I’m not ruining a great friendship if it all goes south. 

I’ve thought of how I could break the ice into a convo about his past experiences or his thoughts about his ex-gf, but that all seems so typical and lame, also he knows for a fact that I’m both single and dig dudes, so if anything, he’s probably feeling pressured. If he were to make some sort of move or affirmation I’m pretty sure I’d be able to take the reigns and turn it into an experience, but until I know for sure or not - I’m not ruining any friendships. 


TL;DR 
	So basically 2 gaymer friends (1 gay for sure, 1 not so sure), gay one doesn’t know for sure if he’s being led on or not, all the signs point to yes, but I’m too much of a newb to icebreak and I’m not ruining a friendship over it.. :)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making this a throwaway as it’s my first reddit post and such..&lt;/p&gt;

I have a rotator cuff injury that will be keeping me out of the gym for a while (its the upper tendon, so most movements with my arms, chest and shoulders cause a bit to a lot of pain--its also radiated down to my left thumb, which has problems bearing weight, too). So what I am wondering from the rest of you is…

How can I keep in some sort of shape (see my profile for some pics) while not aggravating my injury? I know this is a difficult question, but I’m concerned about doing any upper body stuff because I do not want to make this injury worse. I would love to swim, but that involves shoulder rotation, so its off the table, and I despise running/biking because they never feel “right” for me (I have bad balance because of a previous medical issue).

How have you managed with injuries keeping yourself healthy and motivated in general, since you can’t do the thing you enjoy (lifting, running, fitness things)? I’m also worried about my mental health, since working out/exercise is a primary means by which I keep my emotional demons (read: depression) at bay (yay, endorphins).

And to complicate this further, I’m in (a lifetime of) recovery from an eating disorder; so I’m nervous that doing “just cardio” will relapse me back into dangerous patterns of behavior and undo all the good work I’ve done for a few years.

Thats about all I can think of, so I’m hopeful that I’ll hear some things from y’all soon.

I have a *straight* cousin and honestly i was obsessed with him when i was younger. I liked him so much.
 I don't want to make this post long, So, here's the thing:

I used to spy on him when he was in his bedroom (his house was next to mine) and i managed to see through the window (don't ask me how).                                                  I did it many times.
But unfortunately, one day he noticed somebody was looking at him from the outside.... i just just jumped from a roof and ran away like crazy.

He didn't saw my face, but he claimed the person had my same skin colour and also a neighbor (his best friend) saw me running down the street like something had happened.                                                                                  He said he didn't call the police because he was almost sure that was someone close to him.
I acted normal and said quietly that i was running because i was late for work and maybe that person was a robber.

But anyway they told everybody that it was me.                                                      My mother got so mad, grabbed my arm and just warned me: I hope this is not true for your own good because i don't want a faggot in my family.

That was 6 or 7 years ago. I was 19 or 20 and he was 25. I believe.                                       
Don't call me crazy, i know it was long ago but they talk about that sometimes.
My family is very close. We all still live in the same neighborhood. (His friend included).                                                            Leaving that story behind, i have been very good when it comes to hide my homosexuality. But as you saw, my mother h a t e s gay people.

I want to be myself but if i come out, then everyone will confirm that it was me and i won't be able to handle it.                                     I can't believe i was so fucking stupid.                                    I also called my cousin at midnight and hung up the phone as soon as he answered.

This this the worst thing that i've done in my whole life. Please tell me that i am not the only one who has done something that stupid here.

We will call him D. D said that he wouldn't be able to because he was going to be working a lot more than usual this week and he would also be too tired. D wanted to make sure that the first time we would meet he wanted to look his best for me. (Awe moment) so I summed up the courage and asked if he'd wanted to meet that same day. He said yes excitedly. Which made feel excited as well. We would meet in less that two hours and we decided to eat at the local Olive Garden. 

Time came and I was there a little before the exact time we planned ( I hate the fact that I'm a punctual person) and he was there a few mins later. I was waiting for him in the lobby area and messaged him but he wouldn't get back. I was starting to feel worried so I went out. When i got out I saw him there and he was looking for me. I saw him, he saw me and we just instantly smiled at each other. I told him that there was a wait and he suggested going to the B&amp;N cafe right behind. So we walked and we ordered and ate and we had a good time. We were writing our thoughts to each other and even bought some stuff for each other. And towards the end of the lunch he wrote me asking what I was thinking about. I told him that I didn't want him to leave yet (because he had an awards ceremony that he had to attend) and he was sad too.

When we got to his car we were just standing there in silence and we hugged. I thought about kissing him but I didn't. I could also tell that he wanted to too but I assume was waiting for me to make the move. Idk. 

Now here's where I feel guilty. 

A few days before, this other guy, we'll call him X, messaged me flirting and wanting to meet. He asked me what i was into sexually and I told him. I was thrown off because he was pretty up front about meeting ASAP. I told him I would if he would send me a pic of how he looked.  My intention was not really to hook up but was interested in how he looked. He told me that he was discreet and didn't want to show his face. He also assured me that he wasn't ugly or anything. I told him I didn't care but would really want to see how he looked.  He ignored me. 

The night of Valentine's Day X messaged me getting to know me and stuff and asked to see another pic of me aside from my profile pic. I sent him one and he was telling me how cute he thought I was. I told him ""whatever dude"" and he continued to flirt with me. I finally broke down and flirted right back and he was insisting that we finally meet up. I told him only if I saw his face and he again declined. We talked more until we both went to bed and that was the end of it for the time. 

The next evening, the evening after D and I had our lunch, X messaged me telling me to go over to his place. I told him that I couldn't because a: I didn't have my car at the time and b: I didn't know whether if he might be some kind of murderer or something, jokingly. He laughed but insisted. I was getting fed up with how pushy he was getting so I ignored him. An hour or so later I had arrived to get my car and he messaged me to go his place. I told him that idk and that I was nervous. He told me that it'll be ok and that if I didn't want to the he'd stop asking. I told him that forget it and I'll just go to see him just to hang out and possibly make a friend. He gives me the address to his place, we meet and he tells me to have a seat on his couch. I sit and I contemplate wth I got myself into. He sees how nervous I am and asks me if everything is alright. I tell him yeah and he suggests that I don't look like it. I assure him I'm alright. He sits on his couch in a position facing me and sitting close to me. I think to myself ""wtf. Is this dude gonna make a move on me?"" While I was talking to him, he gets closer to my face and says ""don't get scared"" and makes out with me. For a moment I'm enjoying it then I push him back and he says ""what?"" I tell him that it's nothing and he asks me if I'm sure. I tell him that it just caught me by surprise and he gets closer to my face and asks if I want to keep going. I get closer to him and start making out. Next thing we know we head over to his bedroom and just do oral. He wanted to top me but i wasn't in the mood and I've never had been topped so I just offered to give him oral and jack him off. 

After we finished we just laid there on his bed talking about each other and we even cuddled. He even brought up the conversation about being fwb. But I declined (I catch feels real easily.) It was getting really late and we fell asleep spooning and I had to tell him that I needed to go. He walked me out and gave me a kiss multiple times. 

Conclusion
I feel really bad because I felt like I had a good thing going on with D and I want to continue. But what I did the evening with X felt right and it was something I kind of needed. And he keeps messaging me to hang out and stuff. Should I feel bad about what I did or just treat it like something casual that mostly anybody would do?

Insecurity has always plagued me due to me being different but that is also no excuse to lie. Bullies tormented me in school which only made my insecurity even worst than it already was. No excuse still but maybe you can see where I am coming from. Apologies only mean something when you mean them and I mean this one.

A sister suggested that I say sorry. My sister was happy that I confessed to her what I've done on here. Being and saying sorry is the right step in the right direction I was clearly told. Feeling sorry came easy. The next step was a apology which I am doing at the moment. 

Forgiveness and understanding from you all would be great and all but I am not expecting that. My face would lit up with a smile if you forgave me but that is not a solid requirement for me to move on with my life. Moving on with my life is only a option if I am ready to move on with my life which I frankly am regardless of what reaction I get from this post.

Guys never stole my images. Catfish never happened to my selfies. Nobody was ever pretending to be me on here. It was all just a stupid scheme to get attention and sympathy from strangers. Lame I know. I was always the only me.

Dyspraxia and a lazy eye is really things in my daily life but the whole catfish story was untrue in every aspect of the word. 

Ignoring this post is a good choice for those of you that don't know what I am speaking about. Most of you know who I am and what I am talking about though I think.

Deep apologies go out to all of you that thought I was telling the truth. 

What I did was not a crime in any way but I still feel guilty about it. People lie all of the time which is wrong but what I did is nothing really new to Reddit.

Please stop the witchhunt for me. Some people are trying to find out who I am. Threats of violence towards me is not okay. Only a handful of people seem to be super angry towards me though thankfully. 

Again only apologies from me. I am done. Moving on is the only road I am taking now. I suggest that you move on too. 

Signing off for a long time!

Well. Okay.

I am a 20 year old disabled guy with an speech impediment and horrible eyesight. Never been on a date in my life at this point in time. In the USA.

Joined a popular dating site (OKC/OKCupid) last night. Listed my disabilities on my new profile. Added clear un-filtered photos of myself to the profile. Was 100% honest in everything I mentioned in my profile. Wrote about my hopes/dreams/wishes/hobbies on the profile, *blah blah blah blah*! 

So.

I got a lot of ""LIKES"" and messages from random people. I listed I was bi (bisexual) on my profile so I got messages from both boys and girls. I was shocked. I did not expect to be this ""popular"" even though I am confident in myself. A lot of people told me I was brave for being myself and they admired me for that, others said I was cute in both personality and appearance! Some people even said both of those things.

How do I handle all of this attention? I am a 20 year old virgin that has never been on a date in their life. I don't get this much attention in-person when I meet new people! Some boy even invited me out on a date in-person.

I like almost all of the people that messaged me but I really like the boy that asked me out on a date a lot. He is cute and sweet and also energetic! He is also patient. He does not care about any of my disabilities at all. I talked to the boy for hours and hours last night over text. I met him last night but I know he is really the adorable boy in the photos, we FaceTimed and stuff.  

The problem is though. The boy wants to meet up in-person and go on an date. I see no red flags with the boy but I am just not ready to go on an first date in-person. I asked him if we could just chat for a few weeks over text and stuff than maybe meet in-person when I am more comfy and used to talking to him. He said that he's perfectly alright with that if that makes me happy! But.

Am I being over sensitive? I know that most people on dating sites meet up in-person just after a few days or hours of talking online. I don't want this guy to be uneasy in the future because I am new to all of this dating and social stuff.

The guy is also very flirty with me it seems. He is not sexual, just flirty. He calls me babe and stuff just after a few hours of knowing me. Is that common? Is that a red flag? He said he is not really flirty that often with people but he likes me a lot. He also said he never gives out his number but gave it to me because he thought I was awesome and cute. I have no idea what to think of this. I don't have any bad vibes off of the guy but that could be because I am a newbie at the dating universe! Please help maybe explain?

Sorry that this post is kinda long. I just don't know what to really say.

I feel like I may be forgetting to mention something else but I don't know what else to say. If you have any questions than please feel free to ask and help.

I am texting the guy right now...

PLEASE TRY TO HELP A NOVICE DATER.

I quickly made friends with some girls. I never had a male friend before. EVER. I was always picked on by the guys labeled as fag etc. of course it was 'jokingly' according to them. 

There was this guy in class who was picking on me the most. He was the captain of the football team, but he wasn't a real hot guy more like a cute one with big ego. He was called gay before I came to the class. Our moms both got elected as the ""main orgainzers"" of class events (where I live it is more of the parents' thing to organize stuff rather than the school itself). Anyway, our moms became friends and my mom asked his mom to talk to him to talk to me cause I had no male friends in the class and we were in the middle of our sophmore year. So he asked me if I would want to play League of Legends with him (I wasn't out as gay at the time or anything, I was just called gay. I already kinda suspected that I am into guys). We became friends because of gaming and I spent the night frequently at his place, he was at mine too etc. it was really cool, finally I had a friend. 

I fell for him after a while. He literally stole my heart with NOTHING.  Cause normally I do not like guys like him AT ALL. When it was just the 2 of us he was kind and normal. When any other person was present either on Skype or in person he was again - a jerk and kind of homophobic. 

After a while I took some courage and confessed my love to him and he said he feels honored but he doesn't feel the same way. I was okay with his reaction and we kind of never talked about it again. We graduated in 2013. We had fun with the guys at summer I left high-school with being happy between the guys. We went to different universties, but we continued playing together, partying together etc. 

Then around November 2013 I came out to my closest friends, he knew about it too. Around Christmas time I brought up the topic (so a year later) of what he thinks about my coming out cause I knew that he knows but he just knocked it aside saying that I shouldn't be thinking about stuff too much. At a party after a few days we both got drunk and I asked him why he never talks about his love-life or anything (we never talked about emotional stuff cause whenever I mentioned anything emotional he was like: come on don't be such a girl). He said that because I irritate and disgust him and he doesn't feel comfortable with me around. I went home after that. The day after I went over to give him is Christmas present. He asked me if I want to stay (he seemingly forgot about the night before althought he wasn't that drunk). I just went home, wrote a letter to him about my feelings towards him and that I don't know what to believe or do anymore because the other guys are acting homophobic, along with him and it really bothers me. He wrote back a lenghty letter about that I should get over him cause we will never work as friends because I am in love with him. This was the last time we talked. During last year I worked hard to get over him with every way I could. Finally I kind of forgot about him, made new friends at uni and started a new life. 

Everything was cool until my birthday last October when he randomly wrote to me if I have some free time cause he would like to celebrate my birthday (we had a little habit of celebrating stuff by smokin a cigar together at our spot close to the old high-school). I was like WTF but I still met up with him. It was casual I did not feel the old breeze. We started playing again but around November I quitted the game cause it was very time-consuming and frustrating. We stopped talking after that. 

Whenever we met at parties during November, December, January I greeted him but I talked to others I didn't really feel anything towards him anymore. He on the other hand always asked me the where did I go in the past months and why aren't we talking like we used to (he seemingly forgot about that almost a year-long break ???). I just said I was busy studying. In truth I never really went to any all-guy stuff anymore cause they are all kind of homophobic but the study part was true too. We left it that way cause exams came. 

Then this Monday I randomly felt the urge to log into the old game again and he was there too. He asked me if I wanna play a few rounds with him, so I did. He acted really weird. He genuinely praised me for every little thing I did right (he never really appreciated me before). After we played a few rounds he asked what will I do on Tuesday. I said that I will have a hard day with a 2 hour long break in the middle of it. He sent me his schedule and asked for mine and said that if I wanna do something during the day I should let him know. He doesnt have any lectures in the morning so I asked him that he will leave home early to meet up with me for something? He said yea sure. It was weird..he acted like 3-4 years ago when everything was cool.

So now I am really confused what he wants from me? I couldn't write down every detail of course cause I could write a book about the stuff we did together inside jokes etc. wise. But I always felt that we have an intimate connection just he pushes me away and acts homophobic instantly if anything tries to come to the surface or others are present. And now he is suddenly interested in spending time with me again?? Even tho he knows I am interested in guys and I was interested in him and it was awkward?? I do not understand! 
My friends said that I should get him drunk and alone and just simply kiss him and see what happens :D I like the idea of kissing him (of course now the old feelings came back...) but I can't imagine that it could happen. 

WHAT SHOULD I DO?? Just let the things be, and live my life? Or should I try to figure out his intentions/feelings once more? HELP ME GAYBROS!!!
