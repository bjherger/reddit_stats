I just feel like an inept dateless slob.  All of my straight college friends are getting dates and girlfriends one by one. either from their course program, the collage dorms or from parties.  I only met 2 other gay guys in my entire school....and they're dating each other now.

Everybody is looking for love,  they're all gussied up, flirty, and getting somewhere.  I've regressed to just being ""shniggy"" the un-combed guy in an un-ironed shirt with a stack of no less that six pizza boxes sitting on the floor of my bedside.

My local college gsa is so trite,  with wonderful themes of ""wemon take back the campus day"" and ""anti-violence against [Generic Minority] day.""  Even if i could stomach the themed events the group is a joke.  More than half the people are so god-awfully cringy to talk too i either start to think that im a snob or im just as guilty of not being able to carry conversation.

I've done the dating apps, the bathhouses and one night stands.  I lost count of how many guys i fucked without even knowing their name.  I'm tired of sex.  Im downright bored.  but most of all, i've given up any hope over love.  I feel destined to be alone in this world.  When people ask me relationship advice i just get so fucking angry and i have to hide it all.

i'm not sure what else to say.  I dont even think that was an actual question to be honest.

I never knew his name or anything. Ive always known him as the super happy kid that's just really curious about your day. 

But today-
Today, we spoke on a whole new level. He asked me since I don't wear a nametag what my name was. I thought this was my chance, I would finally find out what his name was. Shocked for some reason, I've never been so anxious for someone to ask me what my name was only that I could find out their name. I replied with my name, and asked for his. Without hesitation he told me his name. I laughed and said something along the lines of, ""Haha, now we're basically friends so you should come visit more often"" (don't laugh lol). Expecting him to just laugh and agree, he was really genuinely happy I said that. After that, I gave him his change and wished him a great day, he did the same. Both of us using each others name to say goodbye.
2 hours later- He comes back with friends/siblings still as happy as ever. He placed his order, I made sure it was absolutely correct like always. I said ""Hey hisname round 2?"" with the biggest smile on my face. He replied with, ""Hi, myname I'm back!"" also grinning constantly. Business follows, I tell him his total and give him his change back. But this time he asks when I usually work and I instinctively tell him hoping that one of the days I work he comes back and one of us musters up the courage to say something else. He tells me what he normally orders so I can know if I ever see it pop up on our order screen, in case I'm not the one taking orders, so I can run over to the window to say hi to him.
I tell him I'm usually always at the first window taking cash and order taking, and that if he wants he can ask for myname and they'll tell him if I'm working. He asks ""So I just say ""Is myname there?"" I nod my head in agreement and tell him he's right. Excitedly he thanks me, and tells me he'll see me soon and leaves.

This is the last time we saw each other today, and I'm sure it won't be the last. But now I don't know if I should take his attitude as just him being nice, or if maybe he's trying to show me he's interested in me in a flirty kind of way.

I've asked other people in the store about him and one of them said that he's always nice, but he's never asked for her name before and she didn't know his name either. So, as far as I know, I'm the only one on a first name basis with him. 

Does the way he acted with me seem like he's into me, or does he just think I'm a nice person and is just super open?




EDIT: We're both dudes, so it's a little harder than just asking him out.

Me, my aunt, and my bf were all over at my mom's house for dinner. My aunt brings up BMI (which I think is a bullshit measurement) while my mom ran to the store to get some wine that she forgot to pick up. Annoying aunt asks my height and weight, so I tell her and she busts out an app on her phone and calculates my BMI at 5'7"" and 179 lbs to be 27.9. I tell her I don't know what that number means, and she said it means I'm square in the middle of overweight.

Now, I know that I'm not, and I was about to explain that I have some muscle on me even though she insisted I should lose like 30 lbs (WTF!), but before I can start talking, my BF interrupts and flips his shit on her, telling her I look fine. My mom comes home to the 3 of us having raised voices because I'm trying to calm my BF down, and him and my aunt are yelling at each other. While I am a tiny bit fat and could lose a little bit, I don't think she's right that it's 30 lbs. I think maybe 5? But whatever, I like myself how I am now too so it pisses me off that she has me internally questioning my body, when I never did before. 

We later have a discussion where I told him that I would appreciate talking my way out of illogical things on my own (being a scientist it is easy for me), but that I appreciate that he defends me. How do I relay to him that I like having him defend me, but I don't want to escalate the situation most times? I love that he cares about me so much, I just wish he wasn't SO forward about it when I could have handled myself. 

Also, pic of body, for science (NSFW because I hate clothes):

Basically, I was at a party at my best friend's house. We were playing a drinking game, and I had gotten really drunk. Too drunk to consent, which I kinda realized at the time. Regardless, that didn't stop my from incessantly hitting on this one guy at the party. He was not drunk. At least, if he was he was showing it like I was. However, had I been sober I would not have been hitting on him.

Anyway, I can't remember how, but I remember falling down in one of friend's bedrooms. I got there of my own accord. The light was off. I remember eventually he came in and started groping me and he fingered me. We didn't have sex, though. 

At the time, I enjoyed it kind of. I wasn't exactly saying no because I was beyond drunk and horny. But the following morning I felt really weird about it and didn't want to talk about it that much. I would occasionally joke about it with my friends if brought up, but for the most part I kept it to myself. 

In a sense I kinda feel like I should have seen it coming because I was hitting on him a lot, but a part of me feels like he should have realized I was way passed the line of being able to consent. I was stumbling drunk, and since that party I've never been that drunk since.

As for how I'm feeling about the whole thing, I wouldn't say I feel regret, but I do feel kinda...violated. Like I definitely feel like he took advantage of me, but at the same time I was kinda asking for it by hitting on him as much as I did. So I really don't know what to feel.

So...was I assaulted or was this just making out gone a bit too far? I honestly have no clue what to make of this.

Update: so I decided that I was no assaulted. However, what this guy did was still nothing short of skeezy, I also am to blame since, you know, I was too drunk.

No, I don't think I need to think about my drinking habits as someone mentioned, because I honestly don't drink that often to begin with (that was the first time I had drunken in weeks) nor do I normally get that drunk.

I don't like what happened to me, but honestly I think I'll just get over it. I still maintain that I feel more violated than regret, because I know what regret feels like, and what I'm feeling is not regret. However, that's my problem to deal with and nobody else's.

I don't want to lose a friend, but every day seems like a new struggle with my feelings about him. I wouldn't be a best friend if I didn't try and suck it up for the rest of my life, but I've got to ask anyone who's there. What's it like? Am I going to want to run away when I hear about his new girl? What did it feel like when he told you he was going to get married? How did it feel holding his newborn? Any thing else you wish you prepared to hear about?

He knows me better than most since High School(2006), and our history as best friends is already an incredible story that I know it wont ever be matched. I'm the guy who wanted to fall in love with his best friend but it looks like that isnt gonna happen.

I'm still struggling to get over this idea that it could one day happen, but I'm trying. I've read a bunch of previous straight bro posts already so please spare me your eye rolls. I am currently attempting to stop searching for love and enjoy my friendships, but I forgot how intense the feelings can get when we're just hanging that I want to prepare myself for the future.

If you're a true bottom who can cum hands free, how would you be able to last for a scene like that? Or can you control a prostate induced orgasm like you can a normal orgasm?

My boyfriend and I have been together for almost three years now and we met on scruff. So we do not have many gay friends to hang out with and we would like to have some cool people.

I'm having an issue with being jealous and the thought of him talking to other guys puts a pit in my stomach. He is also six years older than me and has been through the loops of the dating world, while me on the other hand have not. He is my first relationship so I haven't been through all the petty things that happen through dating.
