I'll keep this short. Have been seeing a lad for around 6 months now, but only decided to be exclusive maybe around 2 months ago. We both spend majority of our time together, click really well re: interests and humour. 

I'm really into him, and he's the same. Although the last week he's been hot and cold. We were at his housemate's party the other week and he was odd, evasive and didn't really have much time for me. I went to bed early and he kicked on for a few hours. After being woken up at 4am, I decided to jump back into the party. Chat to him for 5 minutes and then he disappears and goes to bed. Find him asleep 20 minutes later. Thought it was odd, so I kept my distance for a day or so. We hung out again Monday and he was totally fine. 

Previously we've chatted about not putting a label on it, as he wants to just 'go with the flow' and doesn't want to label it - whereas I'd kind of like some stability and not want to waste time/emotional investment into someone who is still 'unsure' even after 6 months. 

I can be a bit neurotic, so I'm trying to be as objective as possible - but I'm unsure how to proceed. Is it normal to spend most of your time with someone, screw, date exclusively etc. for that length of time whilst still not knowing exactly what you want from the other person? 

I think he's scared of being grounded in general (he doesn't know what he wants to do with work/career, school, travel etc.) so I think that comes into play - but I feel as though he wants me there, but doesn't quite know what for. 

He's 22, I'm 24. I think he's freaking out because I'm looking for something more serious and in turn is pulling away now. Any advice would be greatly appreciated bros. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys, &lt;/p&gt;

I remember not having any doubts about the relationship before he left. I remember being incredibly happy. We're going to reunite in a week, and I'm just feeling very confused right now. Most of it pertains to sex.

First of all, I haven't had sex with him for six months obviously. I think about making out with him all the time, but when it comes to actual sex fantasies... I've been fantasizing about other people sometimes, which I feel guilty about. My boyfriend is not my ""type"" but this was never a problem when he was there to hang out with and kiss and hug all day. Being apart... I didn't fantasize about sex with the person who wasn't exactly my type. Like I said, I fantasized about making out and holding hands and stuff with him, but that's mostlyyyy it. Cute things. Sexual things... I inserted other people.

Second.. I'm really attracted to dominance. Ideally, my boyfriend would do things like hold my face in his armpits, sit on my face, make me smell his ass/balls... my boyfriend doesn't have the personality for that kind of stuff. He's definitely a pleaser. He does enjoy bondage/edging me... but feels awkward anytime things skew towards the dirtier side. And this wouldn't be a problem, but I've never been with someone who's ""dominant.""  And I'm feeling the need to scratch that itch, and I guess I always have, but when he was there in person, having him as a boyfriend was most important.

And it still is. I know I'd rather have someone with a heart of gold (which he has) who is more timid sexually, than an asshole who's willing to sexually torture me. I guess I'm just feeling really uncomfortable because my sexual fantasies have kind of taken over in his absence, and we're about to reunite, and I'm not sure how to turn them back off.

Toward the end of the last school year, I chatted with an older man (doesn't go to college) I met on Tinder, and soon he asked me out on a date. Unfortunately, we didn't get to meet because I had to leave for home right away. So we texted back and forth a little at the beginning of the summer, but there was a long break. He's very recently divorced, and he said he'd be ready to take me on a date in September, so I figured I'd give him the time to himself over the summer and not keep in touch. 

I finally texted him as I just got back to school, but he hasn't replied. It's been 2 days now, and I don't know exactly what to do. I figure in another day or two I'll just say something else light-hearted and funny to remind him I initially texted him. If I don't get a response after that, I'll be serious and ask him to reply to at least give me closure (in other words).

Was I naive to believe that 3 months was short enough for him to remain interested? Maybe I took the date idea too seriously, but I'm still very interested. He also doesn't seem like much of a player. And I know this sounds incredibly cocky, but I can't imagine that he has lost interest in me or found someone so much more desirable that he would outright reject me. If he isn't taking me out, I'd guess he's not seeing anybody for the moment.

I'm 23 and have been out of the closet since I was 16. I consider myself a secular (even atheistic), liberal, enlightened individual with no homophobic feelings (toward *others*). Being gay myself, I'm fully convinced that homosexuality is an unchangeable part of someone's biology and character. Please keep that in mind as you read the words below.

I have major depressive disorder that's directly tied to my sex drive and my friendships. I made a great many mistakes in the past seven years that *all* were the result of my homosexuality and my inability to cultivate normal, healthy friendships with straight men. The most recent episode of drama involved a great deal of self-destruction that damaged one of my best friendships. Every time something similar happens (and that kind of thing happens roughly once a year), I dig myself deeper into self-hatred and hatred of my libido.

My whole body and being is shouting at me with a booming voice: I'm not interested in being gay. I never was, and I never will be. I'm not interested in having a sex drive, or sex, at all. I would be much happier without one. Please, make the aching sense of isolation and abnormality *stop*. Return me to a place where I can go one day without objectifying every man in sight.

I'm on the third week of an antidepressant called Wellbutrin that is causing a few side-effects. One of them is irritability, another is weight loss, and another is an *increased* sex drive. So far, I've had no noticeable improvement in my mood, meaning no changes in the number of times I think about offing myself. The fact I'm reminded of my sexuality so often (due to my now teenager-like sex drive) hurts me so deeply because it was what has caused *all* the drama in my life since I was 16. I want to stop having these overwhelming feelings that have led to so much regret/guilt/shame.

There's a very popular antidepressant on the market called Prozac, and it *decreases* your sex drive, but can also make you gain weight. I'm seriously considering asking my psychiatrist to do all he can to weaken my libido by putting me on Prozac instead. My sex drive may not go away completely, but it will be at a manageable level, and I won't care about companionship or appearance because I'll be on antidepressants--those kinds of things won't matter to me anyway.

I'm seeing him (my shrink) again this Thursday. Should I stay on the Wellbutrin and see how it plays out, giving it time to work, or should I ask to be put on Prozac so that I can finally put my sexual angst to rest?~~

edit, 9-28-14: It's been 26 days since I wrote this post, and it seems like an eternity ago. The antidepressants have started to really function, and I no longer feel suicidal. I have a better sense of peace regarding my homosexuality--the world is as it is, and trying to change it produces angst and drama. I'm over drama.

Everyone started forming friend groups at my school, since we're all new to the area and didn't know anyone.  I found a nice group of people who liked to do the same things I did, were fun, and seemed like really good people!   Everything was going great!

Fast forward a couple days when a new guy in our class started hanging out with us more and more.  I didn't really like him at first, because he came off very strongly.  He was super bro-y and had this obnoxious presence that irritated me.  However, he turned out to be really fun and social, despite being a bit of an asshole.   

I thought we were clicking a lot, until I noticed he started being really distant to me in particular.  Since he is so social, he spearheaded a lot of group activities, and more than once I was the only one who wasn't invited by him (the others in the group told me about the activities).  It got more and more apparent until I eventually just asked him about it and whether or not I did anything to offend him.  He said, ""No, you didn't.  I just think we don't have a lot in common.""   

I responded (paraphrasing), ""I'm not expecting us to be best friends or anything.  But I don't really like it when you purposefully try to leave me out.""

To my huge surprise, he said this: ""To be honest, I don't want you hanging around us anymore.  I hate hanging out with other gay guys because everyone acts like we're the gay group or something.""

I was shocked by that and said how that was pretty homophobic.  He responded with, ""You do realize I'm gay too, right?""  Up until this point, I had **no idea** that he was gay.  Looking back, there were some signs, but he completely slipped past by gaydar.  I said, ""This isn't a clique, it's just a group of friends hanging out.  If you don't like me being around, tough shit, because I'm friends with all of these people too.""

This weekend, however, everyone went out to bars and I didn't even get an invite.  I saw a picture of everyone (except me) on Facebook drinking at a bar.  I texted one of the girls in the ""group"" who told me that ""[Asshole] said he texted you but you never responded.""  I also had plans to go to brunch with two of my friends, but they invited Asshole to tag along, and I cancelled like an idiot because I was so mad and didn't want be at a table with him for that long.  It turns out that he brought everyone into the mix, so they had a fun group brunch and once again, I was the only one who was left out.

I'm furious.  I did not do or say anything to warrant being singled out like this.  True, I am a little more obviously gay than him, but that's it.  I haven't done anything to him except being gay.  Who gives a shit if people think ""we're the gay group""?  We're in fucking grad school.  I thought this high school level of drama was over.

I'd love advice for what to do.  I don't want to stir more shit by sharing what he said to me.  Everyone really really likes him and he has an almost cult leader presence, so I'm afraid if I say anything bad about him, he'll make me look like I'm the one who's starting shit.

Should I just focus on hanging out with these friends when I can, and avoid the group events he sets up?   I have no idea what to do.  I feel so alone, because I'm by myself in a new city.  I was feeling so great that I had found a little niche, but now I feel excluded and not wanted.  I don't think anyone realizes what he's doing, and the more things I miss out on, the less part of the ""group"" I become.  It's getting me mad, because like I said, this is some petty high school-level drama.

&lt;p&gt;What the hell? Anyone else deal with this? How do I find guys that want to be friends without involving our cocks?&lt;/p&gt;

I regretted what I missed because I wasted my time going after this guy.  

Another part of me misses the friendship that we had.  I'm trying to have the negatives of our friendship outweigh the positives and realize he's not the nicest guy to begin with, but I am curious to know what he's been up to, and if he's happy.  


So the title says it all.  I'm learning how to cope with this loss, even though it has only been two weeks and it's too soon to completely keep him off my mind.

For me, the one I'm keeping from my boyfriend (yeah, not good) is probably that I just declared bankruptcy. My debts were bigger than my annual salary and the monthly payments were more than my paycheck, and I was drowning. It's not an ideal solution, but it's taken away so so much stress.

In general though, my deepest darkest secret is probably the extent and seriousness of my depression. Everyone knows I'm an emo son of a bitch, but I'm pretty good at putting on a happy face and hiding it. Most days are fine, but other days it just gets exhausting fighting it and I want to give up. It's a constant struggle. I've learned, though, that most people don't want to hear about it and it just brings people down.
