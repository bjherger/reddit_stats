I am gay. I am a virgin. I have hidradenitis suppurativa. I am alone. I need help.

I suffer from a skin disorder that involves having cysts in places like my armpits and my groin. The problem is that these cysts grow huge in size (often to the size of golf balls and sometimes the size of a tennis ball) and when they finally are able to be ""popped,"" they take forever to heal, have a horrible odor, and leave a huge scar. As of now, there is no known-cure or treatment. The scaring to my groin is so significant that I have been terrified of ever trying past first base on my end. I've given a couple blowjobs, but I've never received anything in return. For those who are curious, just search the condition on Google and you will find pictures that are highly disturbing. 

This is what seems to be an endless cycle:

1. I see somebody I am interested in. Every single time, the person is way out of my league (I've never met a person *in* my league).
2. If I'm capable of mustering the courage, I try to talk to them.
3. But when I do, a part of my subconscious automatically pulls myself away, because I am so ashamed of my skin.
4. I end up alone.

We had a first date which went very well (and went overnight), one of the best first dates I've ever been on, real heavy emotional connection and everything. I was very into him and he definitely seemed very into me. We're planning on going on a second date soon.

However, there's a little issue, which, due to my anxiety-prone nature, is kind of a bigger issue for me. He's pretty bad with the texting. After meeting at the bar, I texted him the next day asking him out, and he replies back pretty soon saying he's up for it, but the next week is out for various reasons. I text him a week later, and get no reply. Start thinking ""Oh, he's not interested,"" and get down in the dumps, but then get a reply the next day and we go out the night following. Our date ended in the morning, and the day after that I give him a casual ""Hey, how did (thing that was going on the previous day) go?"" And no reply again for a day. I definitely start thinking ""Oh crap, one of those one-and-done deals,"" and get down in the dumps about it. I figure that's it, but text the next day to make sure with a ""Hey, had a great time, would really like to see you again,"" to which he replies affirmatively an hour later, asking what my schedule is like. I reply a bit after that with my availability, and it's been more than a day since then with no reply.

I get now that he's likely just a person who is *verrrrry* slow with texting, but, if you haven't noticed, I'm a kind of neurotic guy, and it makes me start running through negative scenarios in my head, i.e. ""Well, that dating relationship is over."" I know this is probably something I should deal with myself, but in the meantime, is there perhaps a gentle way on our next date to inquire why he does this/ask him to maybe at least give me a ""let me get back to you?"" Should I inquire if there's a form of communication he prefers? I could invest in a homing pigeon if need be. Or is this all an insane thing to bring up on a second date and I should just deal with it?

Also, for slow texters, any explanation of WHY one would do this? Another friend told me he sometimes does this to play hard to get, which is maybe the most annoying thing I've ever heard.

&lt;p&gt;Having worked with AIDS patients, seen all the stats, and hearing about things like super gonorrhoea, I am scared shitless. Would any of you guys be able to tell me from personal experience how you have gotten over this, whether my worries are justified and what you&amp;#39;ve done to stay safe? Is it worth not hooking up to avoid STIs? At this point I&amp;#39;m seriously considering abstinence until I&amp;#39;m in a committed relationship...&lt;/p&gt;

In normal life when I see a really good looking woman, that's what goes through my head, like wow, she's beautiful. But that's it. If I see a good looking guy, there is an attraction, but it's more like a wow, I envy you and want to talk to you type. I don't get turned on by the sight of a guy.
