so I'm really confused right now about a situation I sort of provoked to happen and just wanted to share it. No specific question in mind.

I've always considered myself to be straight. I didn't date or had girlfriends or anything, but basically the idea of being with a woman get's me going. 

But I really like lot's of topics that are considered to be ""gay"" like singing, Musicals, not-being-sexist-all-the-time, showing my feelings openly etc. So I always had an issue on getting myself into a label given by others of being gay since I was very young (although in the beginning it was ""you're a girl"" and later turned to ""you might be gay""). 

But even though the label was there I didn't give a fudge about what others told me I could be and tried to figure it out myself finding that I really don't want any emotional relationship with a dude. I even tried going ""cruising"" a few times and although of course after a while I got off I never really enjoyed it as I think you should (keep in mind, I'm a ""straight virgin""). 

So my mindset was set to maybe open to the idea of experimenting but not gay. At least that is what I identify as. 

But. In College I got to know one of my current best friends I ever had. I shared lots of pain and enjoyment with him. We have many of the same interests and just get along splendidly. So after seven years knowing him now, our friendship seems to be at its peak. I started living together a few weeks ago and me showing affection to someone else outside of my family that I really like and getting intimate in the sense of hugging him, kissing him (not making out just you know...a kiss on the cheek) basically showing how I feel.

Of course the idea of being gay nevertheless my experiences popped up again. And now I was not so sure. Still am not. 

Problem now is, that he feels uncomfortable with how close I get although he assures me he does in fact like me as a friend and considers me to be his best friend he doesn't want to lose. Tells me to just stop showing affection. And frankly...that makes me mad at myself of even showing something like that. I hate society for treating the things I do and like as something ""gay"" and really hope to get things straight with my friend again (no pun intended) who tells me that he was stupid for ever considering sending wrong signals without talking to me and hopes to not have destroyed everything we worked for.

But I'm just not sure. Not sure to let my feelings go open like that again. Not sure whether maybe I am gay but that whole ""sex with strangers"" thing just isn't for me.  Identity crisis is something I really thought to have avoided in puberty but guess whats getting me now...

Bare with me for a moment, you might roll your eyes, but I'm genuinely feeling a little lost.

Very brief introduction to myself, I'm a gay man in his late 30s and a little bit of an introverted nerd, but definitely love the manly things in life.  I grew up with mostly straight friends, and my initial dealings with the gay scene were.. a little traumatic, ergo I've never been much of a scene guy.  But, these days I have lots of friends, both gay and straight who I trust, but I'm kind of none-scene.  I've been reasonably successful in my career, love my hobbies, got a fantastic fiance I've been with for 12 years, we own a house together, out to parents, friends, family and co-workers.  No big problems in any area.

It's just, that's the problem....

When I was in my late teens I set out who I wanted to be as a man.  A kind man, loyal friend, bit moral, someone who took his career seriously - but not to the detriment of home life, someone who was gay - and wanted to be happy with another guy but very much wanted to settle down with him -  in our house that we owned and share cool things like hobbies.

I was 16 in 1993.  Gay rights weren't THAT far on, I was living in a post AIDS epidemic world, Philadelphia was the most obvious gay movie that I was aware of.  But there were challenges ahead for acceptance, career, love and happiness.  This defined me.  It was a challenge.  I stood up for the little man, was a moral and rather righteous guy, pushed back at the world for a little acceptance and happiness.  It was hard at times, especially wondering about how my parents would accept things, but I met these challenges.  Life was hard, but moral, and I believed in myself, I totally was behind ME.

Eventually, I started to see success in these areas, had some cool friends, shared a few happy years enjoying my bf, laughs and nights with friends.

But since I hit my late 30s, I'm getting lost.

Straight friends are having families together.  Even our best gay friends are adopting and settling down.  Towards the other side of our friends, my scene-going friends are enjoying themselves, partying away...... But I don't want any of that.  Kids seem too much of a hassle (I don't think I could deal with the responsibility), can't stand the emptiness of endless drinks and clubs and friends are slipping away to their families.... 

I'm lacking a goal from this point on. My mind is wandering.  Wondering where to go next but getting a little frantic with not knowing.....

I'm staying up until all hours of the night.  My urges are wandering, checking out hot guys (and talking to them) on Scruff and Growlr despite the fact that I love my bf like nothing on earth. I'm putting on weight as I'm bored with things, sort of feeling listless.  I feel like I need a massive kick up the ass, but I'm damned if I know where that kick would lead me.  I'm angry at myself for not knowing the next step as I've always been very clued up on what I wanted from life.

My best guess is to get a dog.  Uhm, any ideas?
