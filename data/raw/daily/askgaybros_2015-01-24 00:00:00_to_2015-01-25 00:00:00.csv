I've just been on my first date ever. It went OK - could have gone better, especially me failing to get his number and a physical goodbye, hug or handshake (he got on his bike a bit too quickly) but we got along well enough over a cup of coffee and walking around downtown a bit and we both got a few laughs and smiles each out of it, which is more or less what I expected. I'm definitely the more interested party of us two, though, being the one to have initiated conversations, especially before the date (we met on an online GSM site) and the date could just as well have been two friends meeting up rather than something romantic (we never used the word ""date"" in communicating), but I do see a path forward.

I'm not exactly sure how to move forward, though. I'm thinking a dinner, in order to increase the amount of possible coziness and intimacy (not sexual intimacy - though that could be a bonus). Unfortunately, I share the kitchen with 11 other university students and I cannot cook anything more advanced than fish and potatoes. Is having dinner at a restaurant reasonable for a second date or is it too fancy? Or should I suggest something entirely different? And how long should I wait until suggesting it (I expect that I will have to be the one suggesting another meetup considering that I seem to be more interested)? My current plan is starting a conversation again tomorrow night or Monday night and keeping one up about every other day for a week until suggesting the next event. Or should I just expect him to make the next move and drop it if it never happens?

So here's the situation: My parents were split before I was born. I was raised by my dad, just him and me, but I talk to and visit my mom all the time. I'm out as bi to both of them since sophomore year of college, but they reacted very differently; Mom was perfectly fine, Dad temporarily disowned me until he got his shit together (that was a terrible few weeks). It's still a topic that has made him angry and nasty since, and I haven't brought it up in a long time. I've been living on my own in different towns for a couple years now. 

I've been with my boyfriend for a little over a year, and we moved in together this month. My dad doesn't even know I have a boyfriend (Mom's actually met him). I guess I don't know what advice specifically I'm asking for, but I generally feel crappy and guilty about how I've hidden it. He and the step-family live only a couple hours away, I visit them every couple months, they might head down here every now and then. Even though his attitude has been shitty on this topic, severing ties isn't something I want to do if I can avoid it, so I've been a coward so far here. My boyfriend's a wonderful guy, so I don't want to lose that side, either. He's been very patient and relaxed as I try to work this out. 

I just want some input from the outside. Is it so terrible or unusual to not fill in a parent at this point in a relationship? Anybody been in a similar situation? How'd you resolve it? ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys, &lt;/p&gt;

However, I eventually settled on this one. I hope you don't mind Gaybros. :D

Anyway, this is essentially a feelings dump. I guess I just have a lot that I want to get out and off my chest. I'm not even sure if I'm looking for advice or anything. I guess I'm open to it, if you think you've got something to add. Anyway, like the title says, I think this mainly boils down to depression. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not in a totally terrible place. No suicidal thoughts, nothing too extreme, I'm functioning quite well.

I'll start off with the good. I'm in a great relationship with a great guy. He's my rock, and I'm his rock. I'm in a graduate program for engineering. I interact with people on a regular basis, whether it be work friends or close friends on the weekend. I've been seeing a counselor, once every few weeks, to talk about my issues. I'm quite open with the people around me about my depression and what I'm going through. I think I have things under control, more or less.

Overall though... I still feel like shit. I'm pretty stressed out about all the work I have to do in the next few months, and my motivation seems to be non-existent at the moment. I feel like I want to drop out right here and right now, but at the same time, I'm not sure that I do. Part of me believes it's the depression that's talking. Logically, it doesn't really make sense to do that. It's a little bit of hard work, which I'm sure is worth it in the end... I just don't feel it right now though.

I also feel like I need more friends. Specifically, gay friends. I feel like I'm missing out on something. My bf and I see the same (straight) friends every weekend, which is great and I love seeing them. I also have friends from my university days, but I don't know... I feel like I'm growing apart from them. Again, it's probably the depression that's making me withdraw from them, but at the same time I really do think my ideals and values aren't at all similar to theirs, for whatever reason.

In attempt to make more gay friends, I've turned to apps. They're ok, I've made a few so far. I do realize I need to reach out to them a little more though to maintain the friendship. Again though, back to the depression, it makes it incredibly difficult. I've thought about joining interest groups or outings or whatever you want to call them, but I think I've got (undiagnosed) social anxiety. I always thought it was just me and being comfortable with being an introvert, but I'm starting to think there's a fine line between the two. In any case, I have a hard time making it out to any kind of event that would get me meeting new people.

I've accepted it's time that I need to start looking at the possibility of starting an antidepressant. That's been miserable so far though. The first one I was prescribed, Wellbutrin, seemed to be working well, until I broke out in a pretty severe allergic reaction. I then was put on  Pristiq (similar to Effexor), and that was agonizing for the 1 day I took a pill. I think I got every side effect that the pharmacist told me to watch out for. I was literally scared of taking the medication the next day. I understand that with these meds I have to weather the side effects, but I really think it is better to be miserable and depressed than to have to deal with those side effects for a week or however long.

So, with all of that in consideration: I feel lost. I have no idea what I'm doing or where I'm going in life. I'm really hoping that I have more options for meds. I am quite frightened by SSRIs, so I'm hoping there's another one that works similar to how Wellbutrin did. Unfortunately I still have another 2 weeks before I can see my doctor about it.

For some background information, I'm 22, still living at home with my parents and brother while attending community college (that's a whole different issue that I don't want to get into right now). I've known I'm gay for a couple years now, and I'm not out to anybody and don't really have anybody to talk to about it. 

For some reason lately, I've been thinking about coming out more and more but whenever I try, I just chicken out at the last minute. I feel like a coward. I've wanted to tell my best friend for a while but I just my nerves always the better of me. We've been friends since high school and he's like a brother to me and I don't think he'd think of me any differently, but I still can't do it. 

I'm also afraid of how my family would take it. My brother and I are pretty close, so I don't think he would have a negative reaction. I don't know how my parents would react. If you were to look at me, you wouldn't be able to tell I was gay, at least I don't think so. And because of this, I've heard them say what think about gay marriage and other lgbt related things and it's not very positive. But at the same time, I have a gay cousin that they seem pretty okay around, although nobody brings it up, and my mom even attended our friends' wedding this past summer and they are a lesbian couple, my dad would've went but he had work. So I don't know if their opinions have changed over time or what, because they love my friends. But for some reason, I keep thinking that it's different when it's your own son, you know? And I know it sounds stupid and that it's probably just paranoia, but I can't help but think in the back of my mind that they would feel differently if they knew I was gay. 

I don't know what I hope to gain from posting this here, maybe to get some advice, a new perspective, or to just be able to talk about it with someone.

Really in a bad place right now. 

Quick back story: I wanted to come out to my family last year, but I held off cause my Dad left and ruined the family. He's a fuck, we're all in therapy, and shit is brutal. Also, I recently saw my brother on Grindr, so I'm feeling horrible because I know he's also struggling with his identity too. According to my youngest brother, my middle brother came out to him as bisexual, so that was hurtful also and a big red flag to me that I need to work on our relationship. My youngest brother also doesn't know that I'm gay. I want to come out to my family soon, even my Dad because I actually think it'll be enjoyable watching the look on his fucking face. Maybe he'll actually drop dead instead of being the pathetic waste of dead space that he is. 

1) How to approach Mom? She's in a really fragile state, and I feel like she's going to view this as another huge hole in the family. 

2) How to approach middle brother? I feel like I should pay attention to our relationship more, come out to him, and let him come out to me later if he wants. But I already know and I wish he's just fucking tell me already. 

3) How to approach the youngest brother? He's already made a lot of bad comments to me once he disclosed to me that my brother is bisexual. Our relationship, unlike my middle brother, is awesome. I understand that he's 17 and clearly homophobia is natural at that age, but he's already lost his Dad and I'm not sure how to approach it. 

4) Approach Dad? Finances don't matter. In the course of a year, he's literally forced me to emancipate myself from the family financially. He lords money over everyone and acts like he deserves to be the most respected person in the world. When people don't respect him, he goes apeshit. He's a ticking time bomb that clearly needs mental help, but he continually denies he's depressed, even though he's textbook functional depression + midlife crisis + possible mania. 

5) Should I come out to my middle brother first? I feel like if he came out to me, then he might possibly want to come out to the rest of the family together. I know it sounds weird, but it's just an intuitive feeling I have. (We're close and I can still read him, just not as well as with the youngest brother). 

6) I kind of just want to come out to everyone at once. I don't even care. Having the same conversation over and over sounds exhausting. 

7) Should I wait until I feel like everyone in my family has achieved a ""new normal?"" I'm not sure if everyone is equipped to handle this right now or not. 

Lastly, I understand that your opinions are your own, but I'd appreciate negative advice in a constructive manner, not a critical or indifferent manner. The longer post had a prev comment that not only didn't help with my situation, it made me feel worse about myself. 

Much appreciated guys.

I am a native New Yorker. Born and raised on the south shore of Long Island by a jewish Brooklyn mother and a Queens Father and I couldn’t be prouder of that. That by itself leads to people to ask the question of why I chose to go to school in the south. The reason itself has nothing to do with my love of the south. I don’t picture myself staying here after my four years and, as I have said, have a major love for the big apple. There was a few reason I ended up where I am today. The first one being money. I am on a 2/3 scholarship and it’s costing me less to be here then in SUNY (insert city here). The second is I wanted a huge school with pride and football and when it comes to this no one does it better then the south. At first I got stares of confusion from friends, teachers and even my own parents but as my senior year went on most people became comfortable with the idea. The idea never bothered me since I love exploring cultures and learning about how other people live. I didn’t mind that I would be one of the only jews or that most of my friends would be Republicans. This worried my parents a great lot but never for me. As I embark on my second semester here as a freshman I wanted to discuss my time in the south. One of the first things I did when I started school was rushing. I had always admired fraternities and the bonds they produced and always wanted to be a brother of one. This is where I first released I was not alone. I got a bid from a fraternity that I loved and quickly accepted. Most of the brothers were southern and this is where I started to figure out southern mentality. They joked about me being Jewish but in no other way then my friends at home did. I wasn’t bothered by it and some of the shit they said was pretty funny. They didn’t care what religion you were as long as they liked you. Within the first week of pledging my pledge director came over to me and said “I am asking all of you this, are you gay? Cause we don’t want to offend anyone who his” I said no and that was all and I felt glad they didn’t want to hurt anyones feelings. Then it dawned on me, if everyone said they were straight would the gay jokes start? He didn’t want to hurt anyones feelings but what if there was no ones feelings around to get hurt? Does that make it right? I wondered what they said behind the open students backs and wondered how they truly thought about them. Now at this point I am feeling alone and worried that I am the only gay kid to ever be in a southern frat until one night. I was out to dinner to with some brothers when they start discussing how some of the brothers at the top frats at our school had fucked this past week and how one of them was having a relationship with a pledge. I couldn’t believe my ears. I asked how they knew this and said that no one really cares it’s just kept on the down low. I then started to figure out the whole southern world. There was a whole underground gay community. They would go over to “study” and play “xbox” but in reality they where sucking each other off. No one would ever date a guy, and some even dated girls, but there was a whole underground network of gay dating. I got really curious and decided to look into all of this. I downloaded “grindr” and “hornet” (gay dating apps on the iphone) and got to work. What I saw even confirmed my thoughts. I uploaded a few photos of me and when I went to nearby people I found something very interesting. I was the only one with pictures of my face. The rest had pictures of there bodys, the school, or had private photos. I started talking to a few guys and there secrecy amazed me. Before I could see there face they wanted to know if I went to school here, if I was in a frat, my major and anything else that made them feel comfortable. Then they would send a face picture and say something like “We can totally hang out sometime just my brothers can’t know”. I decided to go over to this really handsome frat brothers apartment. What amazed me is once your with them, there horny as hell. They have no shame in being who they are around other gays but are just so afraid of the campus finding out. Now this really only applies to frat guys. There are plenty of open kids all over campus and were widely accepted but there was something about being a gay brother that just raised a red flag and what surprised me more was that these kids were the jockey womanizer types. No one would ever know they liked to make out with men. It was amazing. Some of these kids were even the sunday church going type. It's actually quite nice. It's this whole connection of bros who go from drinking beer and playing xbox to having sex and then going back to drinking beer and playing xbox.

This really isn’t gay related, but I'm not sure if there's a very applicable subreddit for my dilemma and I know you guys give great advice, so I’m just going to post here. So I’m at a point in my life where I need to make a lot of decisions that will heavily impact my future. I’m a junior biology major at a top university in the US. I’m doing really well academically and I have leadership positions, extracurricular stuff, blah blah. Not that I’m bragging (I’m actually really bad at selling myself, a skill I need desperately to improve), but I can go in a lot of different directions. 

I have considered vet school, med school, and PhD programs in biology. I have slowly discarded all three options… This has been my thought process so far: I love animals and have shadowed veterinarians, but I didn’t like a lot of aspects, particularly dealing with disgruntled animal owners. I also didn’t like that they were not really on the cutting edge of things, which is not surprising since the money is in human medicine. So I decided to shadow some doctors. Many of them seemed jaded. They worked long hours, seemed stressed all the time, and also had to deal with angry patients/families. Then I thought that what I’m really interested in is the basic science behind it all. I’m now working in a lab for 10 hours a week, unpaid, not even for class credit. I get degraded on a daily basis by the miserable postdoc, who thinks I should know everything before he tells me. I don’t even understand what I’m doing in the lab and no one cares to explain it to me, but if they did, I don’t think I would be all that interested. They are so focused on the most nitpicky things in biology, which is what you have to do in research, and I think I would get bored with that, too. And they get paid nothing after spending their entire lives in school.

So now I’m trying to find other options… I considered going for a PhD and then going into some kind biotech business, but it takes so long to get a PhD and I’d probably have to deal with a lot of the shit I’m dealing with now for the next five years. I’m not even sure I’m willing to deal with it for the next week. Last night, my friend suggested I look into patent law. Apparently, patent lawyers have to read up on all the current science/inventions they’re dealing with. If you have a BS in a hard science, apparently you can take the patent bar after your second year of law school, which is amazing compared to 5+ years for a PhD, or 4 years of vet school, or 4 years + residency for med school.  But a lot of people are saying it might not be a good field to go into, especially with patent reform…

I just don’t know what to do and I’m feeling very pressured because I basically need to make a decision in the next month so that I can take the appropriate tests this summer. I am so sick of considering all these different fields. I also put a lot of weight on earning potential, which makes me feel like a greedy asshole, but I would like to at least be able to live a comfortable life and one day repay my parents for all the money they have put into my education. I don’t really know what I’m looking for in terms of advice, I’m just going crazy with all these things in my head whilst trying to juggle everything else going on right now. Am I just being an indecisive pain in the ass? Do I sound like a jerk? Or are these legitimate concerns? Is anyone else going through or has anyone gone through a similar situation? Anyway, thanks for reading. Sorry if this turned out to be a pointless rant, I kind of needed to vent. Hope you have a great day!
