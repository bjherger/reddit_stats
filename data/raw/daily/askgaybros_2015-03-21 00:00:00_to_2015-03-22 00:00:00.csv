If this is the wrong sub I apologize, please redirect me. First of all, I (23F) would love him even if the answer is yes. There are a number of unrelated problems with the relationship and I don't think it will last much longer, but I will always deeply care for him. We've been together for almost 5 years, and this has been bothering me for most of them. I am only wanting to know for my own peace of mind. I would never shame him, tell anyone, or throw it in his face during a fight/breakup. 

""Clues"": I walked in on him wearing my tights/jerking off. He enjoys wearing women's panties (not just during sex, but not all the time), and even bought some for himself. He frequently looks at ""traps"" (not gay porn, just chicks with dicks that I have seen). He likes tasting his own cum/cumming on himself. He wants me to wear a strap on. He bought a butt plug ""for me"", but it has mostly been used on him. 

That's all I can think of for now. I understand some guys are into this stuff, and maybe I'm overreacting. I'm glad he has felt comfortable doing some of these things around me, but I don't really know what it means. Hopefully you understand my confusion. All advice/questions welcomed.

EDIT: Wow! Lots of good feedback. You guys are seriously great. I realize the title is a little accusatory, wish I could change it. I do know sexuality is not that rigid and I should not be trying to categorize him. This is all coming from a place of love, and your suggestions have made me even more interested in exploring these things WITH him. This is a great community, thanks again!

UPDATE: Not sure if anyone is still following this, but I got home a bit ago. He told me he ordered something from Victoria's Secret. For himself. So I guess I've been doing a good job of encouraging him.

TELEVISION
Do you still watch television most of the people in the world do watch television.  Have you noticed a change Have you noticed the age of the actors on television?  Just flipping through the channels you will notice that a majority of the programming are kid actors.  Let’s go back in time, the year is 1987.  During that year and there was a popular show on television call Beverly Hills 90210.  The main actors in this program were well over 21 some were even in their 30’s.So what changed?  How did we get from admiring older adults playing child roles. The reason is that children were not to be admired sexually. Or place them in mature audience only type of situations and if you did place children in these adult type situations it would have been classified as child pornography.

Back to the present, here is what you missed. The network that started this is the Disney Channel. With a ridiculous amount of programming with stars ranging from the age of 8 to 17. I am not saying that there are no adults in its programming but their roles are comedic. The adult roles are either the brunt of pranks or of sheer stupidity. With adults on these sitcoms in these diminished roles the kids are charged with having to show romance, sexuality and intimacy. What happened to our standards regarding child abuse? I believe we threw those standards out with the bath water. Also have you noticed that these sitcoms are not airing during normal kids’ hours. They are airing all night long and who do you think are up at those late hours not kids. You may not notice it as much but little by little you watch a little bit more now you are starting to see the appeal.

It is not just Disney it is prevalent on all networks. Some networks may not show sitcoms with children but the commercials are loaded with them. Everything from Doritos to Target. They say that children are the ones that the ads are aimed at. The ad executives believe that children drive the economy by forcing their parents to buy products. One industry in particular cell phones. Now I might be dating myself but when I was a child you were not able to have a cell phone at school. If you did you risked having it confiscated and getting detention. One of the commercials for cell phones featured 4 or 5 kids demanding the most expensive phone with an unlimited plan. Here are some companies who use kids to sell their products.

They are both very supportive and my being gay has been a non-issue for them. My dad's best friend (let's call him ""Carl,"" definitely not his real name) recently moved back to our town. Dad and Carl are each 50, have known each other since elementary school, and were roommates in college. Dad has known that Carl is gay since at least when they were in college. After graduating, Dad stayed here to continue his studies. Carl also went on for more education but in a different city. Dad has remained here, but Carl has lived in a few other cities. They have stayed in touch over the years and have been able to see each other a few times a year at conferences given that they are in the same profession. I met Carl on maybe 3 or 4 occasions that I barely recall when I was much younger, but really had no significant interaction with him. Until recently, the last time I saw him was when I was 12. A few years ago, Carl's long-term partner died suddenly from a heart attack. Carl decided to move back here to be close to his family of origin. Eventually, I was re-introduced to Carl by my dad and I was immediately attracted to him. I have dated men of all ages, but have always liked older men best. That's just how I'm wired. Anyway, I pursued him (even though he was more than a bit weirded out by the fact that I am his best friend's son and basically half his age) and we soon began having really great sex. Because of the dad issue, and to a lesser degree the age difference, we kept things on the DL. For a while we were just fine with having sex and occasional dinners, but things have gradually become more serious and we are at the point where we are spending virtually all of our free time with each other, including overnighters. I have a good job/career and my own apartment, and he has his own house. We often stay at his place during the week, and I have been spending entire weekends with him the vast majority of the time. We love our time together, and have even started talking about eventually moving in together, but we are both concerned about appearances: best friend's son, that he will be seen as some sort of ""predator,"" the large age difference, etc. I think that we have been pretty good at flying under the radar from both of our families thus far, but I am not sure how much longer that will last. Prior to Carl, I had always been quite inclusive of my parents when it came to introducing my boyfriends (and I had a LOT over the years, I won't lie to you), and they have asked several times recently if I am OK because I haven't seemed interested in dating in over a year. I also have another dilemma. Carl has a conference coming up in a really nice private resort location where neither of us has been and would really like to go (together, of course). My dad, however, is also attending this conference, and is bringing my mom. Obviously I can just skip going to the resort with him, but the day-to-day hiding is starting to wear me down. I am getting tired of hiding, but I am scared to death of coming clean with my parents. Any similar experiences or words of wisdom out there? P.S. I am really not looking for any lectures about our age difference. I can do arithmetic and I do understand that health issues increase with age and that older people die sooner.

There's this dude I knew from college and he never showed interest in me at all. I haven't seen him in something like 16 years. I was never interested in him either. We were in some of the same classes and were co-directors of a rather niche-y a capella choir on campus though I never would have called us close friends.

Well, years have passed and we've gotten a bit friendlier (by my estimation) due to working in the same field and all that, and having really similar musical interests, plus a distance of 3000 miles limits my exposure to strictly digital so I'm not reminded of how annoying his personality can be.

Except for the last few months. I can tell it's when he's been awake and horny because it's always when I'm up early in the morning which means it's 3 hours earlier for him meaning he's been awake all night. He keeps sending me these relentless dirty messages on facebook. I've tried blowing him off (get your mind out of the gutter) by making off topic jokes, by pretending not to know what he's talking about, and by straight up saying that I'm not interested, but he'll continue to write back as though I gave some sort of interest and send me pictures of his junk, speculate about the size of mine, talk explicitly about me and to me, and just basically make a nuisance of himself.
I don't want to completely end the friendship because as I've said, I respect him in our respective field of expertise, and he's really not as bad a guy as I've made him out to be (I'm just a bit peeved right now so I'm being less than fair in my description of him), and I don't just want to unfriend him. But how do you stop this from happening when he won't seem to take a fucking hint? Or even seems uninterested in taking a hint. 

Even if I were interested, I'm not one for cybersex or whatever the fuck---I'm a face to face kind of guy and even then I don't do random hookups or drunken debauchery like that. Any advice is appreciated. It's getting really uncomfortable.

I recently turned 19 and so will he next month. We have been together since high school and were able to be roommates this first year of college, which is as awesome as it sounds!. We will also be roommates again starting in the fall. I came out to my parents when I was 15. They fancy themselves as liberal and progressive and have been supportive all these years at least on the surface. Of course, this is because I have sort of intentionally portrayed my being gay as something I ""am"" and not something I ""do."" What I mean is that I have never talked to them about dating, or my boyfriends, including my present boyfriend, and definitely never about any of the sex I've been having. So my present situation might be my own fault.  Let's call my boyfriend ""Justin."". Justin's family has had job and money problems and his parents had to sell their house at a loss and move in with his mother's parents across the state. He is lucky to have a full tuition scholarship that also pays his dorm fees during the year. He will not have to drop out or take on loans but still needs to earn money when he can. He has been offered a pretty decent paying job in our hometown for the summer. Not enough for him to afford a place but enough to make a decent amount of money that will help out next school year. That means he will need to have somewhere to live. I probably should have approached my parents with things in a different way but what's done is done. This weekend I have been back home for a visit and I sat them down this morning and updated them on Justin's situation. I asked them if it would be okay if he stayed with us over the summer so that he could take this job. They've known Justin for years and he has spent many nights and weekends in my bedroom. My parents were only aware of us being ""best friends"" which was true, but they were not aware that we were also boyfriends. They immediately agreed to him staying at our house over the summer. I then told them I really felt that I needed to tell him one more thing. And I told them that he and I are boyfriends and had been even during part of high school. They both appeared distressed about this and started stammering things like they didn't think I was old enough to be having sex and certainly not old enough to be living together as a couple.  I was upset but not altogether surprised. I have sort of always felt that they were liberal in principle as long as certain things did not become hard reality (pun intended!).  They said they were unsure after hearing this if Justin should stay with us over the summer.  I started choking up and pleading with them and pointing out that he didn't have any other options and he really needed to make money over the summer.  They said they needed to talk.  A while later they decided that they would agree to Justin staying with us and sleeping in my older brother's old bedroom, but they wanted us both to promise them that we would have no sexual activity in their house. I told them that I thought they were being unreasonable given that Justin and I had already been living together as a couple for eight months. I stopped short of adding that Justin and I already had sex in the house countless times during high school. I told them I would have to talk with Justin.  I called him and he was really not too upset with the situation. He was actually happy that we would still be together over the summer and that he would have a place and could go ahead and accept the job offer. He also added that we could just tell my parents whatever they wanted to hear and then do whatever we wanted when they weren't around or were asleep. He reminded me that we had lots of car sex in various spots around town in high school. I agreed that doing it under the radar was an option but I also pointed out that we had spent the last eight months falling asleep and waking up together and I didn't want to give that up even for one summer.  And also, even though I think my parents are wrong, I don't want to make a promise to them that I know good and well I will not keep. So I'm putting this out there to my gaybros. Should I just shut up and be happy that I will still see my boyfriend every day over the summer and we'll just fuck on the DL (but risk getting caught)?  Should I stand up to my parents and tell them that whatever illusion of ""innocence"" they're trying to protect is loooooonnnnng gone?  Should we try to find some kind of last-minute summer dorm option, which would also require finding different employment options? I really do love my parents, but I also love my boyfriend.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am finishing my freshman year of college along with my boyfriend.
