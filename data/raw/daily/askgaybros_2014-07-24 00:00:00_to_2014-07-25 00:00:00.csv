Right now I see myself attracted to men and women but in different ways.  

My earliest memories of sexual attraction are being attracted to girls in my school classes (around the beginning of middle school).  I do have a memory around that time of a male friend trying to kiss me, me pretending not to like it, but secretly liking it.  I went on to only be attracted to girls during this period, and I honestly didn't think about this memory until much later.

In high school, I started watching straight porn and masturbating to it.  One of my teachers was gay, I was somewhat attracted to him, so I decided to watch gay porn on a whim and liked it.  I watched it for a while but then drifted off to straight porn until college.

To this day I am still a virgin... I was somewhat sexually frustrated during my second year in college and downloaded Grindr and began flirting with guys around me.  At this point I probably watched 50-50% gay and straight porn.  

My interests in men and women are somewhat different... I would say I am on the whole attracted to a larger percentage of women than I am to men, but it depends on the individual.  For instance, I find Channing Tatum extremely attractive but Oprah Winfrey not attractive at all (no offense to her lol).  I am, however, sexually submissive and would prefer a dominant partner... something much more common in men.

What would I be classified as?

My dilemma concerns a bit of unfinished business with my best friend from high school. At the time we were closest we were practically joined at the hip I was very much in love with him (in my closeted, ""just best friends"" kind of way) but in the years since we have drifted very far apart and barely talk outside of the occasional text a few times a year. The fact that we aren't tight doesn't bother me very much - the fact is that we don't really have much in common and frankly he may not have been that good of a friend to begin with. But here's the story...

So, I've known my friend ""Pete"" for ages as we went to school together pretty much since Kindergarten. In high school we had a lot of the same friends and were part of a lot of the same extracurriculars and we became really tight, until we were hanging out, talking on the phone, or chatting online every day. You guys know how the story goes. Of course at this time in my life I am so deep in the closet that I'm finding Christmas presents, and the fact that all the other guys in my class would constantly play grab-ass and grope each other in a jokey way meant that I was getting a lot of confusing messages from him. We never ever fooled around or entertained the notion, but it wasn't uncommon for Pete to touch me in ways that really turned me on. Things progressed in ways that really mixed me up: there were times we would hold hands (not in a gay way, of course), we'd say ""I love you"" and mean it, and we confided in each other with pretty much everything. For me, the sexual tension was unbearable. I became really jealous when he got a girlfriend and think he probably picked up on it. I eventually got the sense that he was intentionally distancing himself from me, which I totally understand. I think we can all look back on the ""in love with my straight friend"" phase with a cringe, but to be fair he wasn't very emotionally mature either, yada yada yada.

By the time we graduate our friendship kind of tapers off. We stayed fairly close but he had betrayed my trust and otherwise proved himself to be a less than loyal friend in a few ways that aren't entertaining or relevant enough to explain. We went to different colleges and after awhile any meaningful conversation/correspondence stopped. We hang out when we're home for Christmas and whatever, but don't share much of any real connection anymore. But suddenly things got **weird**.

One summer I carpooled with him and a few other friends to a wedding out of town. One night he and another buddy got drunk and I volunteered to drive. At the end of the night it was the two of us alone in the hotel room for a moment. He says to me, out of fucking nowhere: ""I think I'm attracted to guys and I think you're the reason I realized this."" I was blindsided - is he joking? Just drunk? Being serious? I had no idea what to say, so I didn't even acknowledge that he said it at all - I pretended I didn't hear him. Keep in mind this is before I'm out to anyone, let alone myself - so I did nothing. And as far as I can remember, he really wasn't THAT drunk. We haven't spoke of it since. 

This was a really weird moment. He had girlfriends before, and I'm pretty sure he was into them (or at least seemed more into them than I was my high school beard). While he joked around and acted all touchy feely and homoerotic around friends back in high school, I do remember him talking about being into girls. But I don't understand why somebody would just say that jokingly--and considering the extent that he would take the gay/not gay charade with me (even when it was just us two), I supposed that maybe there's some truth to it.

Fast-forward to about a year and a half later. By now I've kind of flown out of the closet and have told mostly everyone close to me. I decided it's time to let him know, but communication between us is weird and stilted, so I send him an email. I know, probably not the most ideal mode of communication--my decision was informed by an incident when he sent me several angry texts because he thought I was upset with him, and when I tried to call him to talk about it he sent an email. I figured it was what he was most comfortable with. I initiate the conversation with inoccuous small talk, and he replies. So, the next email I tell him that I came out and that everyone has been great and supporting. Again, phrasing it in an innocuous, no-big-deal kind of way. Well, he never responded or acknowledged it... and that really stung. I have texted him since, meaning to get drinks or meet up while I'm in town but it never really works out with his schedule.

I suppose it's a fitting response considering that I was too chicken shit to think of something--ANYTHING--to say to his out of nowhere comment at the hotel. I really feel terrible for my silence. Lately I've thought about reaching out to him. I don't really have much interest in rekindling a close friendship, but if he was actually trying to tell me something or get something off his chest (i.e., come out!) then he deserves a chance to talk about it.  What if he meant what he said? If it's true then he probably doesn't have much to turn to (religious/conservative parents, not many friends)... I'm tempted to send him another (ugh) email, but to give him the option to ignore it and pretend he never received it if he wants. I don't want to thrust anything on him if it is indeed a matter of coming out for him, but at the same time I want to give him a chance to speak if he was trying to when he first said it.

But here's where I may sound selfish. If he dismisses his admission at the hotel, or otherwise mentions something about being uncomfortable/retrospectively weirded out to think that I was in love with him... that sounds like a very weird conversation and I can't see him being too mature about it. If the thought never crossed his mind, well then he's a bit oblivious. The thing is, I don't want to have to explain myself. Because if the reality is that he's more or less straight and less than comfortable with the fact that I had feelings for him, then I can guarantee that my embarrassment at the issue is far greater than his.

So, I guess I'd just like to hear some opinions and thoughts from the folks who have ever decided to close the books on some lingering issue like this one. Should I just forget about it? Is this worth thinking about or do you see it backfiring? 

**TL,DR:** I was in love with my best friend in high school, we had a close and very homoerotic relationship without any actual fooling around. We drift apart toward the end of high school. Later, he makes ""drunken"" admission to me that he was into guys/possibly me. I was closeted/blindsided and didn't acknowledge the comment at all. When I come out of the closet a year or so later he never responds to the email. Contemplating reaching out and  giving some closure to this and asking him if he wanted to talk about his comment. But not sure if it's worth it or  if it could just get weirder.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apologies in advance for the novel that I&amp;#39;m about to write.

&lt;p&gt;One summer I carpooled with him and a few other friends to a wedding out of town. One night he and another buddy got drunk and I volunteered to drive. At the end of the night it was the two of us alone in the hotel room for a moment. He says to me, out of fucking nowhere: &amp;quot;I think I&amp;#39;m attracted to guys and I think you&amp;#39;re the reason I realized this.&amp;quot; I was blindsided - is he joking? Just drunk? Being serious? I had no idea what to say, so I didn&amp;#39;t even acknowledge that he said it at all - I pretended I didn&amp;#39;t hear him. Keep in mind this is before I&amp;#39;m out to anyone, let alone myself - so I did nothing. And as far as I can remember, he really wasn&amp;#39;t THAT drunk. We haven&amp;#39;t spoke of it since. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a really weird moment. He had girlfriends before, and I&amp;#39;m pretty sure he was into them (or at least seemed more into them than I was my high school beard). While he joked around and acted all touchy feely and homoerotic around friends back in high school, I do remember him talking about being into girls. But I don&amp;#39;t understand why somebody would just say that jokingly--and considering the extent that he would take the gay/not gay charade with me (even when it was just us two), I supposed that maybe there&amp;#39;s some truth to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast-forward to about a year and a half later. By now I&amp;#39;ve kind of flown out of the closet and have told mostly everyone close to me. I decided it&amp;#39;s time to let him know, but communication between us is weird and stilted, so I send him an email. I know, probably not the most ideal mode of communication--my decision was informed by an incident when he sent me several angry texts because he thought I was upset with him, and when I tried to call him to talk about it he sent an email. I figured it was what he was most comfortable with. I initiate the conversation with inoccuous small talk, and he replies. So, the next email I tell him that I came out and that everyone has been great and supporting. Again, phrasing it in an innocuous, no-big-deal kind of way. Well, he never responded or acknowledged it... and that really stung. I have texted him since, meaning to get drinks or meet up while I&amp;#39;m in town but it never really works out with his schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose it&amp;#39;s a fitting response considering that I was too chicken shit to think of something--ANYTHING--to say to his out of nowhere comment at the hotel. I really feel terrible for my silence. Lately I&amp;#39;ve thought about reaching out to him. I don&amp;#39;t really have much interest in rekindling a close friendship, but if he was actually trying to tell me something or get something off his chest (i.e., come out!) then he deserves a chance to talk about it.  What if he meant what he said? If it&amp;#39;s true then he probably doesn&amp;#39;t have much to turn to (religious/conservative parents, not many friends)... I&amp;#39;m tempted to send him another (ugh) email, but to give him the option to ignore it and pretend he never received it if he wants. I don&amp;#39;t want to thrust anything on him if it is indeed a matter of coming out for him, but at the same time I want to give him a chance to speak if he was trying to when he first said it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But here&amp;#39;s where I may sound selfish. If he dismisses his admission at the hotel, or otherwise mentions something about being uncomfortable/retrospectively weirded out to think that I was in love with him... that sounds like a very weird conversation and I can&amp;#39;t see him being too mature about it. If the thought never crossed his mind, well then he&amp;#39;s a bit oblivious. The thing is, I don&amp;#39;t want to have to explain myself. Because if the reality is that he&amp;#39;s more or less straight and less than comfortable with the fact that I had feelings for him, then I can guarantee that my embarrassment at the issue is far greater than his.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I guess I&amp;#39;d just like to hear some opinions and thoughts from the folks who have ever decided to close the books on some lingering issue like this one. Should I just forget about it? Is this worth thinking about or do you see it backfiring? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL,DR:&lt;/strong&gt; I was in love with my best friend in high school, we had a close and very homoerotic relationship without any actual fooling around. We drift apart toward the end of high school. Later, he makes &amp;quot;drunken&amp;quot; admission to me that he was into guys/possibly me. I was closeted/blindsided and didn&amp;#39;t acknowledge the comment at all. When I come out of the closet a year or so later he never responds to the email. Contemplating reaching out and  giving some closure to this and asking him if he wanted to talk about his comment. But not sure if it&amp;#39;s worth it or  if it could just get weirder.&lt;/p&gt;

We didn't really talk much at first just only when I needed to go to the front office. Well one day, he approached me very innocently and complimented me.  (mind you I've never been approached before so this was huge to me).  So after a week of ""is he or is he not gay"", I finally decided to make my move and ask him and see if it would lead any where.  Well it did, and we had a date that same night.  It was such a great date, we clicked on so many things.  We had dinner and a movie and then spent like two hours just talking about life and making out in his truck .  It could not have gone any better.  The topic of past relationships came up (I know, bad idea, but it came up oddly naturally) We both had been hurt before, but where as I was looking for a new relationship, he told me he had given up on them. However, and this is what gets me, he said that I made him feel like he could try again. 

Fast forward to the next weekend and we were on our second date. We had been texting all week as well, cute things here and there.  Everything just seemed like it could be leading up to something great.  On our second date we had a really nice dinner, again we clicked on so many things. We actually talked about some personal stuff as well.  Again, stuff that you shouldn't really talk about with someone so new.  But he was just so comfortable to talk to and I guess he was comfortable with me as well.  Nothing felt awkward or forced, our conversations just flowed.  We laughed, we disagreed, we teased. 

After dinner, we were back in his truck making out, things were getting a little friendlier then last time.  He reached for my neck and gave me massage.  He said I made him happy which really threw me off.  In a good way mind you, it stunned me and made my heart smile. 
Naturally I said he made he happy too (and it was true, he did).  However, one thing lead to another and his hands were in my pants and mine in his.  He wanted a little more though and asked if I could use my amazing lips on his dick instead of my hands.   

Now I'm all for making out and giving little teases hear and there, but on a second date I am not about to suck dick (I mean maybe if I new him better or we started a relationship then I'd suck his dick all day long!) But I just didn't feel comfortable doing that so soon.

Well I told him maybe we could save that for when we knew each other better, he agreed, and his mood didn't change. We continued to make out (hands not in pants) and talk for the rest of the date.  He told me to text him when I got home because he wanted to make sure I got home safely (my truck had engine problems when I got to the restaurant and he knew I lived on the other side of town). Which I did and he replied said he was glad I got home safely. 

This was nearly two weeks ago and I haven't heart from him since. The Monday after our date (on Saturday) I texted him like normal, hey hows it going, but didn't get a response.  After that I waited a week to send a second text, asking what was up but still nothing. 

Now I know I shouldn't have gotten my hopes up so quickly on a guy I had only been on two dates with. But the things he did and said just melted my heart and I couldn't help but fall for him.  I guess what I'm confused about this why say things like I make him happy or that I make him feel like he can try a relationship if it ultimately lead to him dropping off the face of the earth like this.  Was it really because I wouldn't put out like that on our second date? 

I'm not looking for advice on how to get with him or anything (well maybe lol) because clearly that ship has sailed.  I just thought sharing would help me deal with the confusion and mini-heartbreak.  But if anyone has some insight into this or has had this happened to them before it would be nice to feel like I'm not alone in feeling this way lol.  Honestly though, if he did decided to one day contact me again I think I would give him a second chance, only this time with loads more of optimistic caution.
