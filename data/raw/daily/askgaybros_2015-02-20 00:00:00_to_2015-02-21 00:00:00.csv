I feel so bad that I did this to my wife. 

Before I begin the story, let me be clear: I see nothing wrong with being gay. It is what it is. However I identified with being straight, but maybe I was just in denial because I didn’t allow myself to explore that side of me until I met a man that unexpectedly forced me to confront my sexuality. Unfortunately this happened in my late 30’s and I’m already married with 2 kids.

2 years ago I moved to a new neighborhood after getting a new job opportunity. A neighbor, who lives a couple houses down from me, started to hang out with me. He is married with 3 kids. He’s extremely social and is friendly and nice to EVERYONE. We hung out a lot. We would drink a lot, make jokes, watch youtube videos, and go to sporting events. We just enjoyed each others company. In the beginning we would hang out almost daily and text all day. My wife was totally okay with it. After a few months his wife started having a problem with it. But we still would enjoy spending time together. Our kids would play together, I would go with him to hang with his friends and he would go with me to hang with my friends. We got so comfortable with each other that we would get jealous when one of us would hang out with our other friends without one of us. I knew this was not normal, but still did it. At one point we said we loved each other, but I was very clear that I loved him like a brother. We would get so excited to see each other that we would hug each other, not like a bro-hug, but a real hug. We text each other to share what we are doing and where we are going. We would say we missed each other often. We tried to get our wives to become better friends so we would be able to spend more time together. We never did anything inappropriate, besides the gay jokes and the occasional smacking my ass. Well I never smacked his ass, but he like to do it with me jokingly, more than normal. But I did enjoy it. Over the course of the two years, I fell in love with him. I haven’t felt this type of way about anyone since I met my wife in college. 

I would think about him all of the time. I would wonder what he was doing. I would look out my window to see if he’s home. If he wasn’t I wanted to know where he was. My feelings were so powerful and confusing that I couldn’t concentrate at work or at home. So in the beginning of 2015 I decided to stop talking to him and hanging with him. So we only spent time together once since January. I thought I was doing a pretty good job controlling my feelings for him. I stopped texting him and I stopped telling him where I was going when he wanted to know. Sometimes if I went away for the weekend tho, he would keep texting more to figure out where I went. If I saw him outside I would just go inside my house without acknowledging him and he was doing the same thing to me. Even if he invited me to go somewhere with him to hang out, I declined. Last week we happened to be outside together and he came by, and we gave each other a long, big hug in front of my house, and we told each other how much we missed each other. It felt AMAZING. All of those feelings that I was managing to suppress rushed out. I can’t help but love being around him and talking to him. I want to tell him all about my day and stuff like that. I want to know about his day and shit like that. I just want to be around him because it simply makes me feel good.

So, how do I know that I’m gay? 

I like to jerk off in the shower in the morning. Lately I haven’t been able to get aroused in the shower. Normally I don’t have this problem. I wondered what was going on and then decided to think about him to see if that would help. I imagined us kissing and then jerking each other off. Only then was I able to get aroused to jerk off. So at that moment, I came to the realization that I am gay and my sexual attraction is for him and not my wife. To be clear, he’s not even that physically attractive and slightly overweight, but I still find him attractive. Sometimes when he talks I stare in his eyes and think about how much I love this man.  


Here’s the addition problem. I love my wife, but I’m not emotionally connected to her the way I am with him. During sex with her, she’s able to work her magic and get me aroused tho, but lately things aren’t going well for me and my wife. That’s why it was so easy for me to spend so much time with my friend, but I do enjoy spending time with my wife. I love laughing, touching her and having sex with her. It’s hard for me say if I rather be around her than him because it’s not like I don’t want to be around her. I constantly ask her to spend more time together, to share more intimate moments the way me and my friend share them, but she doesn’t want to. One time she had a close girl friend and I think she was emotionally connected to her. I told her I thought she was gay as well, but she didn’t respond. One time several years ago, I think she was deeply emotionally connected to one of her girl friends. They eventually stopped speaking to each other and we don’t bring it up anymore. She most certainly doesn’t seem emotionally connected to me anymore. But I love her and want the best for her anyway possible. 

Back to my friend. 

I’ve been trying to stay away from him, but the feelings are still there. I don’t know what to do. There is such a powerful connection and it makes me so confused.

So tonight has sucked a fat one (in a bad way). My boyfriend of 10 months and I just broke up. To be more precise, I broke it off with him.

We've been tentative since we got together, with a fight or two every month. I felt somewhat trapped in the relationship. I did love him but I also wanted to be by myself, I wanted to be able to do whatever I want without having to deal with having a tagalong or someone to answer to. He was the opposite and wanted to spend every minute together.

He started an argument today about how I've been distant lately and it spiraled pretty out of control. He quickly threatened a break up (which he's done quite a few times but doesn't really want to, he just gets angry). I followed through and broke up. It was the worst timing ever. We had a holiday planned for this week and each of us have put $1000 in for it. It's far too late to get refunded. I feel so much guilt about ruining this when we've looked forward to it for months.

**Here's where my questions kick in;**

Am I stupid for not staying with someone I love?

Would it be bad for me to go on the holiday alone? I hate wasting money and I was excited to go. But I know he's the same, I just ended up with the tickets.

I'm scared that he'll try to get back together and I really want to let it happen, especially just for the holiday.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi guys,&lt;/p&gt;

&gt; So sometimes, a little self-realization and a hypothetical kick in the stomach can be a good thing. You tell yourself ""I'm okay. Really. It's okay. Everything is just okay and I'm alright. It's alright. Everything will be alright. Nothing special, it's fine. Really. Everything is just fine. I'm fine. It's going to be just great."" But in reality, you're not.

Last summer, I met this guy online and we've been chatting as friends. He's in an open relationship, good looking, tall, fit with nice blue eyes. Basically, a person I wouldn't expect anything out of since he's obviously dating someone and feels out of reach for me. I'm pretty short (5'6), a little on the heavier side, Asian boy. Obviously since we have our own lives, we talk fairly infrequently. But I enjoy it since it doesn't hurt to just talk to someone about how your day has been, what you're up to, and so on. But unfortunately, it died down and it wasn't until recently that we started picking up chatting again. 

I was up late working (around 2-3am) on a presentation when I saw him come online again, so I thought I'd say hi. Turns out his boyfriend just broke up with him and was just trying to distract himself from thinking about it. Since my presentation is about chocolate consumption, I was obviously eating chocolate for the sake of research and decided to offer him some. I guess he wanted to get out of the house to stop moping around so he actually accepted my offer and drove near my house to pick it up. I thought to myself, ""I need a break from work so might as well help a friend"". He lives around 10-20 minutes away from me and I packed some sweets for him and got on his car at like 3am to go to a 24 hour coffee place. Pretty sketchy, I know. But we drove around, thought the coffee shop was closed so we ended up parking somewhere quiet and just started talking. 

He obviously had a lot on his mind at the time and instinctively, I offered him a hug. Then the inevitable kiss and make out happened. In hindsight, I really shouldn't have gone with it because of his emotional instability, but I couldn't avoid it. So he drove me back home, exchanged numbers and continued working on my project, took a nap, went to class, presented, texted him right after.

Since then, we've been texting constantly. We'd text each other good morning, good night, sometimes with some selfies here and there. I thought to myself, ""Maybe we're actually getting along."" He'd send me texts like ""If I was there right now, I'd fireman carry you out of there."" while I'm in class. Then he started calling me names like ""cutie, babe, bae"", which are obviously endearing but a little playful and cute. I wasn't sure if it was flirting, so I obviously tried to flirt back and it was going along. I asked my close friend about this and she gave me the advice of ""Just go along with it."" Because deep inside, he is still emotionally unstable and unavailable and sometimes mopes around from what he told me. I really thought to myself how I shouldn't be doing this. I'm in my last year of my undergrad, working on my thesis and really shouldn't get myself involved with this. But I couldn't help it. His response to every flirt I do was obviously what I want to see and feel.

For over a week, we kept on chatting and chatting, until Saturday afternoon. I was stuck at a train station in a blizzard. He offered to pick me up and take me home and also invited me to stay over for the weekend. I honestly have never done that before and lied to my parents about staying at my friend's place to work on a project. For once, I felt like such a rebel as if I was going to break a bank or something. He picked me up in the blizzard, drove me to his place, and I was cold so we cuddled while marathoning shows, which is what I would normally do on my Saturday night. Minus the cuddling. So really, I saw no harm in it. The night ended with us spooning naked and making out and went to bed around 1am. But in reality, I couldn't really sleep much since it was so warm. But it was a nice feeling in general. I was tossing and turning and he was too and we woke up, just being silly around each other until my mom called asking when I'm coming home. He was quick to respond and drove me home as soon as possible, which was really considerate of him. I never told him about the whole first time thing.

During the drive home, he missed the exit to my place on the highway a couple of times and we just talk throughout. It was nice and during that time I thought to myself how maybe he did that deliberately to continue the conversation. We got to my place, kissed him before I went out of the car and told him to text me when he gets home. I thought everything went well, but I guess things started going downhill from here.

Valentines Day was coming up and my school hosts an annual Sexy Bingo (let's face it, there's really nothing sexy about bingo) and we talked about it and he wanted to go but his parents were on their way home from their trip. So he obviously couldn't come, which was fine. We still texted on occasion, but it was less frequent until he completely ignored me. I don't know why. Maybe it was moving too fast. Maybe I was too clingy.  Maybe he got back together with his ex, I don't know. But I just want an answer why and didn't expect him to just end it like that. I texted him a couple of times, gave him a few days of space. I really want to call him but something tells me I shouldn't. I guess that's too much to ask and I knew it was too good to be true.

_________________________________________________________________________________________

**Currently**

We've all done it and we still do it—ignoring people. ""How long does it take for ______ to stop talking to me?"" is a question we sometimes all ask when we're annoyed at someone. But when you're on the other side of the fence, waiting for an answer, it can sometimes feel quite miserable. I mean, I tried my best to be there for him while he's moping around, but now that he's done with me, I guess I'm thrown out like tissue or a sticky note.

So today, I was talking to my close friend about this and she said:

&gt;My advice to you—try to find out what happened but if you can't figure it out, *just leave it be*.

Because you know what? There are times when we need some closure and I figured, might as well. I really got nothing to lose asides from being a total creep and pushover in someone's eyes, and that's a risk I'm willing to take. So I know of his Facebook/Skype account and decided to message him on those. I explained to him how I just want to know what's going on, if I said anything, and if he got back together with his ex, I'm happy for him. All I ever wanted in the first place was his friendship; nothing more, nothing less. Because as I said, he was too good to be true.

But right now, all I really want is an answer from him whether we're still friends or not. But in this case, I'm not really counting on it and knowing I tried is good enough for me to be able to sleep at night. I might have let my guard down too much on this one and really ruined my chances of becoming friends with him again—and that's what's really heartbreaking.

If I can't sleep tonight, I'll probably draw it out and make some art to share.

What do you think I should have done?

(Looking for more than a one sentence answer like ""idk when I noticed I was looking at guys when watching porn lol"")

What steps did you take next? 

Did you pursue a relationship or go for a hookup to confirm your suspicion? 

What sort of thoughts did you have or what questions did you ask yourself that took you from questioning to acceptance to openness with friends and family?

For context, I am 26 and quite sure I'm gay. Not sure how to tell close friends (some of which I know will be supportive) let alone family (most of which won't be supportive). I live in a small city so it'll be difficult to pursue a relationship without coming out. I recently downloaded grindr and started talking to a few people on it. There are a few guys that I have the option of hooking up with - something I would like to do just see if being with a guy feels right and to normalize something that seems like a way bigger deal than it needs to be. Any thoughts, stories and advice you can offer a bro with not many people he can talk to?


**Update:** [UMWANK](http://imgur.com/eTqN2c7) for those of you who want to see. I took a screen shot of my phone but couldn't upload it til I got home. And I just got home because I hooked up with a dude on grindr. It was great! Any nervousness I had went away. It felt so surprisingly normal and he made me feel comfortable the whole time. We started with making out and soon playing with each others' nipples. This lead to undressing each other, which turned into him started going down and lightly biting my nipples while stroking my penis then started to suck me off. I was getting pretty turned on and asked if we could sixty nine for a bit because I'd always wanted to try it. We then took turns deep throating each other until I came. I gave him a heads up but he didn't seem to mind still sucking. He fumbled around for his shirt in dim lighting and used it clean me up my load that I had spilled on me. Then he asked if he would be alright with him fucking my ass (He knew it was my first time and we discussed everything we would be open to trying beforehand). I asked if he had a condom and lube and he said yes. I was on my back and he started lubing up my asshole while we made out. When he put his penis in, it was excruciating at first. I told him/he could tell I was in pain and went slowly inside and just held it in there for a bit. He then helped push my legs back toward my head so we could kiss. He started going back and forth real slow and then a little bit faster each time, still while holding my legs back and making out. I had to ask him to slow down a couple of times but by the end he didn't have to slow down at all. After he came we both he stayed there for a bit. After pulling out we talked and kissed a bit more then I took off. I lit up on the way home and my body felt relaxed in a way that it hasn't been before. Though I'm not sure what a prostate orgasm feels like exactly, either I had one or will be doing [this](https://imgur.com/rJHCaWl) when I actually do.  Really nice and decent looking guy. I can't see it going anywhere further than being fuck buddies, but he was a good first guy.

**TL;DR** 6 hours ago, I was unsure if I should hook up with some stranger on grindr and 1 hour ago I just got back from my first hookup and it was awesome!

There are a few guys that I have the option of hooking up with - something I would like to do just see if being with a guy feels right and to normalize something that seems like a way bigger deal than it needs to be. Any thoughts, stories and advice you can offer a bro with not many people he can talk to?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=""http://imgur.com/eTqN2c7""&gt;UMWANK&lt;/a&gt; for those of you who want to see. I took a screen shot of my phone but couldn&amp;#39;t upload it til I got home. And I just got home because I hooked up with a dude on grindr. It was great! Any nervousness I had went away. It felt so surprisingly normal and he made me feel comfortable the whole time. We started with making out and soon playing with each others&amp;#39; nipples. This lead to undressing each other, which turned into him started going down and lightly biting my nipples while stroking my penis then started to suck me off. I was getting pretty turned on and asked if we could sixty nine for a bit because I&amp;#39;d always wanted to try it. We then took turns deep throating each other until I came. I gave him a heads up but he didn&amp;#39;t seem to mind still sucking. He fumbled around for his shirt in dim lighting and used it clean me up my load that I had spilled on me. Then he asked if he would be alright with him fucking my ass (He knew it was my first time and we discussed everything we would be open to trying beforehand). I asked if he had a condom and lube and he said yes. I was on my back and he started lubing up my asshole while we made out. When he put his penis in, it was excruciating at first. I told him/he could tell I was in pain and went slowly inside and just held it in there for a bit. He then helped push my legs back toward my head so we could kiss. He started going back and forth real slow and then a little bit faster each time, still while holding my legs back and making out. I had to ask him to slow down a couple of times but by the end he didn&amp;#39;t have to slow down at all. After he came we both he stayed there for a bit. After pulling out we talked and kissed a bit more then I took off. I lit up on the way home and my body felt relaxed in a way that it hasn&amp;#39;t been before. Though I&amp;#39;m not sure what a prostate orgasm feels like exactly, either I had one or will be doing &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/rJHCaWl""&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; when I actually do.  Really nice and decent looking guy. I can&amp;#39;t see it going anywhere further than being fuck buddies, but he was a good first guy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt; 6 hours ago, I was unsure if I should hook up with some stranger on grindr and 1 hour ago I just got back from my first hookup and it was awesome!&lt;/p&gt;

Long story short;

I've never bottomed before, and I tried it once the other weekend. It really stings and hurts, even when done slowly. I just don't understand how it's possible to do it and have it be pleasurable for extended amounts of time, nor was it really that pleasurable for me. I feel like I'm just not used to it (read: stretched enough. heh.)


At the same time, I also don't want to be a spoil sport for my partner.


Bottoms, Just how do you do it? Is it something that's always supposed to hurt the first couple of times you do it? How long did it take you before it became a good feeling? Is there a thing you can do to help ease the pain over time?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, embarrassing question on a throwaway. Long story short;&lt;/p&gt;

He picked up all of his shit one day while I was at work and never spoke to me again. 

Fast forward  about a million years and I am recently married and have kids. I have absolutely no idea what he's up to. He had blocked me from all of our social media outlets when we broke up, but the other day I was looking at the ""people you may know"" o n facebook and he popped up. Meaning he had unblocked me. Then I was checking my phone and it said he had ""liked"" a status of mine, but when I looked at the status he had unliked  it. I'm assuming he accidentally hit it while scanning through my page and then realized what he had done. 

So, basically , I'm asking if I should reach out to him and say hi? Our relationship was full of mistakes and ended horribly, but I grew up with him and really did love him as well as you can in highschool and your young twenties. 

I'm happy now and would love to see what he is really up to, and how far he's gone in life. I just don't want to come off like I'm interested in rekindling anything with him. Because that might really make him angry, or lead him on depending on how he feels.
