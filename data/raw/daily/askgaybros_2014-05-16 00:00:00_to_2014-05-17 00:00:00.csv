See, I've pretty much always had straight crushes, since 7th grade honestly. I'm 25 now, and I came out almost 10 years ago, and yet I've seen this cycle of straight crushes repeat itself over and over again. At the very least, I've gotten to the point to where I can immediately spot it, recognize why I'm trippin', and deal with it. Sometimes I deal with it internally, usually externally, and it doesn't always end well. 

My old roommate from college recently moved to my city, and in with me when he got a job here. He used to be my straight best friend, and now he's my best friend who's straight. Well, one night a few months ago, we ended up watching porn together for the first time[I've known him for 2+ years]. Ever since then we've managed to jack off together like twice a month. It's pretty much always straight porn, specifically lesbian porn[I've become a lot more comfortable with vaginas!]. I tried once, early on, to touch his dick, and he said no, firmly. I am very much in favor of enthusiastic consent, so the idea of disrespecting his wishes like that really turns me off, but I can't help but be so horny for him now! 

Anyway, its frustrating, because I just keep hoping that one day he'll turn around and want to fuck, or suddenly be okay with me blowing him, and I am completely aware that this isn't going to happen. I mean, hell, he and I have had a few small, awkward conversations about it. The fact that he is so accepting[still awkward, but understanding] about my lust, doesn't really make it any easier. I keep telling myself that it's just horniness, but deep down I know that I would want more, even if it ever got to sex.

So, I'm not really looking for advice here, because despite the fact that I want to keep watching porn with him[and keep watching him squirt], I know that it's probably time to start weaning myself off of him. I mean, we're pretty much always around one another, and its probably not healthy to have that kind of codependence. 
I'm just looking for guys to share their own situations, no matter how long ago, in which they had a straight guy crush. Whether or not your personal situation ended badly or awesomely, it's probably just a good thing to share our experiences.

I've been living in Los Angeles for about a year and a half. I made the mistake of falling in love in this new city while being so new. I built my social life around him, and his friends, as I had nobody else. 

Long story short - he broke my heart. I quickly realized that I am so alone in this city. No friend to provide a shoulder. No girlfriends to hang out for lunch. No one to hang out with. All my friends and family are 2700 miles away. 

I tried meetups, and they were fun but no real connection. I tried going to gay bars or clubs, but I felt so creepy being alone going up to random people (they probably thought I was trying to hook up). 

So I was wondering if any of you have been in my shoes before, or have any tips. This is depressing. :( 

A little about me: 27 year old, professional, dog lover, with a nerdy side. 

Thanks!

&lt;p&gt;If something positive in the future, I have a career and he starts college in the fall and works at a gym full time. The college is 10 mins away from me&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: This may just be a F buddy situation actually. He asked to chill plans changed and he asked me to come to his place.  We spoke made out he blew me and he had work.  Last thing he said next time it will be sucking him soon when we have more time. I said no as a joke and he said well we did meet on the app for this and laughed. &lt;/p&gt;

I've always thought I might be gay growing up. I'd always look at men and attract to them.

I could tell if a woman is good looking, rate them, have a preference. But there was no draw like there was to men.

I dated my high school best friend starting when we were 17, we've known each other since kindergarden.

I told her I was unsure of my sexuality, but I'd try it. In reality, I thought I was gay, but my willingness to b with her made me try it.

I found her good looking, but my drive to have sex with her was never there like men. I had never had sex with a man though.

When I had sex with her it felt good, but I always watch gay porn, and always think ""what is a man like"".

Anyway, fast forward to 3 months ago. I get my first full-time job, life is starting to get real. I told her I cannot take this questioning anymore. I cannot take the wonder. Everyday I feel guilty about what men mean to me.

She told me to try it with a man and see what happens.

I couldn't handle that. I had to break up.

We broke up.

For the last 3 months, she is still my best friend. We talk daily, hang out, etc. Our romantic relationship is over though. She is still the most important person in my life.

Part of me not taking the guilt is our best friend.

We share the same male best friend. He is 22, and we met him a few years ago. He is straight. He very fast became sort of the third wheel to us.

He got a girlfriend that is totally OK with us being his best friends.

Our relationship is VERY close. More so than most people would probably be conformatable with their SO having. I trust them both totally. And everyone is honest. We joke about sex, talk about it, hug each other, etc.

Its made our relationship better.

The thing is, I find him sexually attractive. I have a crush on him. I would date and have sex with him if he was gay. I would probably leave my GF for him. She is my best friend. She is. I love her. My sexual feelings for him are stronger than for her. Its the truth. I still love her though.

I finally after 3 months of breaking up met a random guy and had sex with him.

I didn't know him, and wasn't that attracted to him. I just REALLY wanted to get it over with and tried it.

I thought having sex with a man would totally finalize my feelings and calm my anxieties.

Nope.

I'm just as confused.

I liked the sex, it was OK. But it wasn't as amazing as I thought it would be. It felt good, got aroused, wanted to do stuff, but I wasn't attracted to him as a person that much, so it was confusing.

I'm just as confused now as I was before I had sex with him.

I don't know what this means.

What do I do? Do I try having a relationship with a guy I'm actually really attracted to?

Am I bisexual?

What do my relationships with these other people mean?

I have other close male friends. I find them all sexually attractive and would date them. I love them, they mean a lot to me too, and I hang out with them all the time. Is this unhealthy? What does this mean?

Isn't it really wrong to feel all this and to date a man or a woman?

Can I keep any of these people? I feel SO guilty I feel all this.

I'm ALWAYS told that its completely fucked up. I can't know them. I shouldn't know them. Its unhealthy. Its unfair. I'm stringing people along. I'm cheating.

I'm told if I'm gay I cannot know her. I cannot ever talk to her.

I'm told if I'm not gay and bisexual this friend has to leave our lifes.

I'm honestly sitting her crying and not knowing what on earth this means.

Meanwhile him and my ex-gf still talk to me, and we still hang out like nothing is different.

Its so confusing. I just cry. I feel guilty talking to ANYONE. I feel like the worst person. I hate myself for all this.

Any person I know I feel guilty knowing. If I like someone and attract to them as a person in any way. Even non sexual. I feel guilty about it. I'm scared anyone I know is for sexual or emotional gain over a SO. I feel guilty I feel love for more than one person.

If you can read the whole thing, thank you so much. 

After graduating university last summer, I split up with my girlfriend of 5+ years and was shocked at how different life was with all this time to myself. It was a great and reassuring realization that she was a destructive person for me and I started feeling more comfortable exploring myself and enjoying single life.

In this process I realized that, even though we were in a serious relationship and I most definitely had feelings for her, that I still had undeniably much stronger feelings for guys. I think I have kind of always known I was not straight, but just recently (about two months ago) had a late night, serious revelation that I am 100% gay. This hit me like a brick wall and was difficult for me to deal with at first. I know every situation is different, so I'm just trying to figure out the right way to handle my own situation.

Some background; I am 24, I live by myself and work a lot for a very small company, so my exposure to new people is fairly low. I have one very close friend here, and another that lives out of state. Both are straight girls. My ex has since moved away and the break up was a little rough on both of us, so we don't talk anymore. Aside from that I am lucky to say I have a solid relationship with my immediate family and don't feel that they would look down on me at all. Is it common for people in their 20's to come out? I feel like because it's taken me so long to realize this about myself, that I've been lying or been disingenuous with everyone that's close to me. Trying not to think like that, but it's hard/impossible for me to get out of my head.

So, after processing things for myself and deciding at that moment that I would no longer repress anything and just be gay, I was pleased that not much changed for me. I would still go to work, attend meetings, go see shows... nothing about my day to day changed, but at the same time I felt that I needed to tell someone. I told my best friend over Skype the next night and she was amazing, didn't force me to put a label on myself and gave me all the time in the world to just talk and be upset. The next day I told my friend who lives nearby, and she also was just like ""okay, cool!"" and that was awesome.

But since then, I haven't told anyone else. My brother lives on the west coast and works very long hours, and I wouldn't feel right telling him over the phone if he's already stressed out about work. I also kind of want to tell my parents face to face because it just feels right, but they also live in a different state. I'm about to move to the East Coast for a new job, and have a month left where I currently live. As such I've got a lot more free time on my hands and have been focusing more on the move across the country, but even though I've already told a few friends I still feel weird about a lot of things.

My friends are being so so supportive, but this is so much harder than anything I have ever imagined. And I feel like at the end of the day I'm dealing with it all on my own.

I skype with the friend that I came out to first pretty much every other day or so. And it's nice because I can just relax and we can drink a beer and bitch about our days/jobs/etc. But the whole time all I have in the back of my mind is that I feel like it's always on my mind... ""what am I going to do?"" ""how will my ex girlfriend react?"" ""how will my friends from college react?"" ""I totally proved everyone in high school right."" Stupid stuff that I know is not good to think about and that shouldn't even make a difference, but I can't stop myself from thinking them. We can skype for hours, but at the end of the day, when we both log off, my mind is still racing and it is still overwhelming. I feel like a jerk because, despite all the support I'm getting, I'm still struggling more than I have with anything else before in my life. I welcome it and know they're doing everything they can to help me, but it has not gotten any easier.

I've got a little bit of time left in my current city and want to enjoy it while I can, but I don't have anyone to talk to that directly knows what I'm going though. I've yet to have a day where I'm not just passing time trying to get my mind off of things. Am I overthinking and making this way more complicated for myself than I should? I thought it would be an easy enough transition to A) realize I was gay B) decide it is okay to be gay and C) stop lying to myself and actually... be gay. But I've already done that and things still don't feel I've made any personal progress.

TL;DR - Figured out I was gay after a long-term relationship; but struggling to figure out what to do next and don't have any gay friends, so feeling very alone despite having complete support from my best friends.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is way longer than I anticipated it would be.

And it&amp;#39;s nice because I can just relax and we can drink a beer and bitch about our days/jobs/etc. But the whole time all I have in the back of my mind is that I feel like it&amp;#39;s always on my mind... &amp;quot;what am I going to do?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;how will my ex girlfriend react?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;how will my friends from college react?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;I totally proved everyone in high school right.&amp;quot; Stupid stuff that I know is not good to think about and that shouldn&amp;#39;t even make a difference, but I can&amp;#39;t stop myself from thinking them. We can skype for hours, but at the end of the day, when we both log off, my mind is still racing and it is still overwhelming. I feel like a jerk because, despite all the support I&amp;#39;m getting, I&amp;#39;m still struggling more than I have with anything else before in my life. I welcome it and know they&amp;#39;re doing everything they can to help me, but it has not gotten any easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve got a little bit of time left in my current city and want to enjoy it while I can, but I don&amp;#39;t have anyone to talk to that directly knows what I&amp;#39;m going though. I&amp;#39;ve yet to have a day where I&amp;#39;m not just passing time trying to get my mind off of things. Am I overthinking and making this way more complicated for myself than I should? I thought it would be an easy enough transition to A) realize I was gay B) decide it is okay to be gay and C) stop lying to myself and actually... be gay. But I&amp;#39;ve already done that and things still don&amp;#39;t feel I&amp;#39;ve made any personal progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR - Figured out I was gay after a long-term relationship; but struggling to figure out what to do next and don&amp;#39;t have any gay friends, so feeling very alone despite having complete support from my best friends.&lt;/p&gt;

I've been out to all of my friends and family that I talk to and interact with for a while. But I didn't switch my ""looking for"" section, so most people who hadn't seen me for a while (i.e. old high school and college friends) hadn't gotten the news. But last night I went ahead posted photos of my boyfriend and I on hike together, and I got a positive reactions from unexpected quarters. I fully expected some of the old football teammates to defriend me, but not a single drop!

Now the photos were not a Michael Sam and Vito Cammisano kiss, but there were couple photos, no one could say ""oh they are just very good friends."" I set the privacy level to the lowest value (Friends of Friends), so future employers could certainly see it.

So my question to you guys is: are you guys affectionate with boyfriends around random people or causal acquaintances? I know that isn't practical for some of you guys: [see the Deep South](http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2014/05/13/hrc_s_project_one_america_to_help_southern_gay_and_lgbtq_people.html?wpisrc=obnetwork) but week by week this is changing!
