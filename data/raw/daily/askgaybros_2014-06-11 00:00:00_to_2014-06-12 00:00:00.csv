No shame to any of you gaybros if this is your sort of thing, but I absolutely despise all the gay hookup sites like grindr, jackd, etc. I went through some abuse as a child that just makes those apps seem absolutely disgusting to me, the way its all just out there, and all about sex. About 4 months ago, I logged into his google drive account just out of the blue. I decide to look in the trash, and in there, is a screenshotted picture of another guy's penis on the ""jackd"" app. I confront him about it and he admits that he sexted 2 different guys. Some pictures of his ass and penis. During this time, I was in the hospital because I was very, very sick. And since I didn't explain to him what I was doing, he ""felt neglected"" and thought I was ignoring him. We had a huge fallout where I gave him all his stuff back and told him to never contact me. As way leads on to way, we eventually talked, and after hours of sobbing together, I decide to forgive him and move on. That's a big problem of mine. I always forgive and forget too soon. Even if I know it's not for my own good. The excuse he always gave me was that he ""saw it as porn"" he didn't actually thing it was sexting, just porn. So the question I have for you guys is, have you ever experienced anything similar, and how did that turn out? Or just overall, any advice that you have to give a lost bro. I can't stop thinking about it now, especially since the askreddit cheaters thread. I just feel like second-hand garbage, and like I'll never be good enough for him. Do you guys think he'll do it again? Should I stay with him? Do you guys need more information to render a verdict? Since then, he's seemed very committed to never doing it again, and I believe him, but there always that lingering thought in the back of my head.

I am a 21 y/o male who is bisexual, but predominately straight (2-3 kinsey). I have been in a sexually active relationship with my girlfriend for about three years.  I truly love her and could see myself spending the rest of my life with her.  

She is aware of my sexuality and attractions to males but does not really know the true extent.  My ultimate sexual fantasy would be to have a threesome with another guy but I've never asked.  She has directly told me (as a side comment in other conversations) that she does not want anyone else in our bedroom.  My sexuality is a kind of taboo for us to talk about.  We are both aware, but its a kind of ""don't talk about it and it will go away"" deal for her.  

I have never had sex with anyone but her.  Not even blowjobs- nothing.  I am the definition of bicurious- I am curious as to what it would be like to be with another guy.  I watch gay porn occasionally and enjoy checking out other guys. 

Even with this attraction I am not sure I could ever have sex with another guy.  I am ok with being top- my gf enjoys anal- and have never been a true bottom but I really would like to be.  (my gf is unaware that I like any kind of anal)  I would suck a dick if I was single and had the opportunity, spite one thing.  I hate cum.  The smell, taste, feel, sight- everything about it.  It disgusts me.  Granted I have only ever had my own to play around with.  I also hate the smell of shit in the bedroom.  I always make my gf have an enema before anal.  

As of right now I am more sexually satisfied than I've ever been, but I do not know if it will last.  My worst fear is that I will marry her and then cheat on her with another guy later in our marriage.  I wish I could call the relationship off to go and experiment, but I don't feel I could find anyone better than her either way.

I've been with my boyfriend for five months, but we were best friends for over four years before that (long story...basically we both were closeted, realized we had huge crushes on each other, and now we can't keep our hands off of each other).  I am probably going to marry this boy once he's done with law school.

While he's at school, we live six hours apart.  A month into our relationship, he asked for permission to hook up with girls (no sex, just making out).  We have all the same friends (single straight guys), so when they go out, they like to get drunk and prowl for girls.  I guess he liked being included in the festivities, plus he's a huge attention whore sometimes, so I can understand why he'd want girls to fawn over him.

I said I had no problem with this when he asked me, because I didn't at the time.  It was very nonthreatening, and he said he'd always let me know when it happened.  It was actually entertaining at first, like I'd get a text at 2am saying ""haha made out with this dumb slut named Jessica"" or something, and then he'd send me a candid picture of her when she wasn't looking (obviously he's drunk when stuff like this happened).  Apparently he also even tells girls that he has a boyfriend.

However, I'm starting to feel mixed feelings about it.  I noticed it happened much more recently in the past month - every Friday &amp; Saturday night we weren't visiting each other, plus a Tuesday, a Thursday, and the one night when he texted me he ""hooked up with literally 4 girls but no worries he didn't bang any of them"" (drunktext spelling fixed).  I don't think he'd ""cheat"" on me, but we're starting to get a lot more serious, and it's making me feel...odd.  Not really jealous or upset, just *off*, if that makes sense.

He tells me that I can talk to him about anything, so I explained this to him last weekend.  He said he'd 100% stop doing it, but then I felt really guilty asking him to do that.  I know he loves attention when I'm not there, and my ex was a huge, huge buzzkill, so I'm always paranoid about becoming that.  I told him that he didn't have to stop, that I was just letting him know.  He said to keep him in the loop and talk to him about my feelings on this - that he didn't want this to turn into a problem and he'd respect my feelings no matter what.

I just...don't know.  Like I said, I don't really know how I feel about this.  I *want* him to have fun with our friends, but something still feels off.  He said I should try it too, but I don't go out like he does because I don't have as many friends in this city, plus that was never really my style even when I was single.

What would you do?  Should I nip this in the bud and ask him to stop?  Should I let him keep doing it?  Should I say he can do it but I don't need to know when it happens?

Also, the reason he's making out with all these girls and not guys is: a) basically all his friends in that city are straight, so they're not going to gay bars, b) guys basically throw themselves at him all the time, even when we're out together, so I think he likes the ""challenge"" of girls more, and c) pretty sure he loves giving our straight friends shit for being able to hook up with hotter girls than they can.

Also he's asked me twice to have contests when we're apart where we both ""compete"" to hook up with the hottest girl that night.  I told him no, because I have no desire to make out with some girl just for shits and giggles.  But I think this proves that he's not emotionally into these hook ups, it's all like a game to him.  Which weirdly turns me the fuck on, but that's another issue entirely.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The title says it all, really.

I don&amp;#39;t think he&amp;#39;d &amp;quot;cheat&amp;quot; on me, but we&amp;#39;re starting to get a lot more serious, and it&amp;#39;s making me feel...odd.  Not really jealous or upset, just &lt;em&gt;off&lt;/em&gt;, if that makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He tells me that I can talk to him about anything, so I explained this to him last weekend.  He said he&amp;#39;d 100% stop doing it, but then I felt really guilty asking him to do that.  I know he loves attention when I&amp;#39;m not there, and my ex was a huge, huge buzzkill, so I&amp;#39;m always paranoid about becoming that.  I told him that he didn&amp;#39;t have to stop, that I was just letting him know.  He said to keep him in the loop and talk to him about my feelings on this - that he didn&amp;#39;t want this to turn into a problem and he&amp;#39;d respect my feelings no matter what.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just...don&amp;#39;t know.  Like I said, I don&amp;#39;t really know how I feel about this.  I &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; him to have fun with our friends, but something still feels off.  He said I should try it too, but I don&amp;#39;t go out like he does because I don&amp;#39;t have as many friends in this city, plus that was never really my style even when I was single.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would you do?  Should I nip this in the bud and ask him to stop?  Should I let him keep doing it?  Should I say he can do it but I don&amp;#39;t need to know when it happens?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the reason he&amp;#39;s making out with all these girls and not guys is: a) basically all his friends in that city are straight, so they&amp;#39;re not going to gay bars, b) guys basically throw themselves at him all the time, even when we&amp;#39;re out together, so I think he likes the &amp;quot;challenge&amp;quot; of girls more, and c) pretty sure he loves giving our straight friends shit for being able to hook up with hotter girls than they can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also he&amp;#39;s asked me twice to have contests when we&amp;#39;re apart where we both &amp;quot;compete&amp;quot; to hook up with the hottest girl that night.  I told him no, because I have no desire to make out with some girl just for shits and giggles.  But I think this proves that he&amp;#39;s not emotionally into these hook ups, it&amp;#39;s all like a game to him.  Which weirdly turns me the fuck on, but that&amp;#39;s another issue entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

The other day I first attempted anal sex. The circumstances behind it were not desirable. It didn't feel right and I basically did everything in my power to take as little as possible. It hurt and made my ass burn. The guy wasn't even that big. I've tried playing with myself and it felt okay but didn't really get me off. As a kid I was raped a few times by my cousin. That was about 12 years ago so I'm pretty much over it.

I've tried giving anal but whenever I go in I can't keep myself hard. I try my best but I always go soft when attempting to penetrate.

My question is: is it possible to have a relationship without having penetrative sex? It seems the crux of a gay relationship in the sex department is anal. I'm afraid that my lack of being a top and the growing fear of being a bottom is going to push any potential partner away because our sex life won't be all that splendid. I've gotten guys off on oral alone but for some reason receiving oral can be painful sometimes. I think my glans may be overly-sensitive because that's the quickest way for me to lose an erection during a blowjob.

Are there any bros out there in these kinds of relationships? Any advice or tips? I'm not really financially well off to afford buying toys either.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good evening bros,&lt;/p&gt;

Warning: This is relationship-esq advice of sorts.

So for a preface here. I met a guy on the app we all know too much, but we actually quite hit it off with conversation. By that I mean we chatted all night, exchanged numbers, and really had a solid flow going. The type of conversation that comes quite easy and fun. 
Fast forward to a few days later. We get together at my apartment and try to watch a movie, but we do not really pay attention of course and get bored. IT was kind of my fault because I picked a sappy movie that we both, unbeknownst to me, have seen prior. (For those wondering it was Safety not Guarenteed.... it was okay...)
We watch like Vikings or whatever, not too important. Well, it moves on to discussing what else we want to do and I make myself quite clear that I am not a hookup one night kind of guy. He was cool and we honestly just cuddled and fell asleep, which is weird for a first date/get together whatever.
Stuff is still good and so on, we get together watch Game of Thrones this last weekend and watch like each others youtube favorites blah blah blah not too important other than it seems pretty natural.

So really the issue lies here I suppose. I do quite like this guy somewhat, but hes not out. This makes it hard for me. I want to move to a new phase of actually trying to go on some sort of date and ""swoon"" him, but I think he is really reluctant to be in public.
I don't want to like give up on this guy, but he has pretty high walls emotionally and stuff.
Im at a loss, and don't want to come off as trying to push him to get together. 

I apologize for the wall of text, but I am confused on what my next play should really be. This guy is pretty legit and Im lost. Should I just put the ball in his court?

My Dad however is completely opposed to me moving away, the man who has lived much further away 3 or 4 hours up in Scotland for the past 13 years and who just recently moved back to the area because he wants to be near his children *before they grow up* (I'm 23, brother is 26, oldest brother is 29 - he's obviously a bit late for that).

He keeps telling people that I won't be able to hack out the new job and that it's a terrible idea for me to move down, apparently it's not worth the risk. I've told him time and time again that there's nothing for me in this town, that there's no career opportunities and that I'll be happier in the city (where there's actually other gay men) but he doesn't listen.

He thinks I'll be paying too much rent for a place that I'll be sharing with 3 other people (one who's a close friend), that's near the city center and fully furnished. I'll be paying £375 a month to live there and my room is one of the larger rooms in the house, I'm not an expert on city living but it seems a decent rate compared to other places in the city.

I've tried convincing him as much as I could about the place and the move but he's so stubborn he won't be happy with it at all, I'm going to view the place in person before I make my decision to move in and I've decided to take him with me to try and convince him but I just know he's going to bitch about the place and tell the landlord that he's ripping me off...

Here's the back story

My boyfriend [28] of several months and I [26] have been going through the usual troubles of most couples. I wanted to have sex almost every day, he wanted it only once every fortnight. He worked crazy shifts as a server, I worked the typical 9-5 job. He loved to sleep in and spend the day just in bed (I mean like 9-12 hours on his free days), I woke up at 5 ran, worked out all before work and bouldered after work. Needless to say, we we're complete opposites. 

So over the past weekend, while we were at Governor's Ball, we, or at least I, didn't have as much fun hanging out with him. I voiced my concerns that we don't seem compatible anymore. He interpreted it as a break up and freaked out. That Saturday night, as I was rocking out to the Strokes, he went back to my place and trashed the shit out of it. I ended up spending most of my Sunday morning just throwing most of my stuff and salvaging what I could. I talked to him about it yesterday(in a public space) and he told me that he still loved me and was sorry for reacting badly. I feel the same way, however, I did manage to get my keys back and I gave his back too. 

Here's my conundrum for you gaybros. How do you get over someone, who you feel so strongly for but is clearly not good for you. I mean I fucking hate him, but I fucking love him too. What's worse is that there are times during the day when I can't stop thinking about him. He was really the first person I've opened up to and felt I truly loved.

I&amp;#39;m a naturally very jittery/tense person so the whole relaxing my throat thing is hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve heard of people getting a lil bit of poo when bottoming but I dont think I&amp;#39;ve ever heard of anyone ever vomming on someone&amp;#39;s junk. Imo vomming would be much more embarassing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried the whole squeeze your left thumb thing and it didnt work. Should I just practice on bananas or something? (that seems a bit dangerous tho)&lt;/p&gt;

I am a 30 year old guy who falls pretty high on the masculine scale. I have been out to friends and family for 12 years. Typically the average joe would not peg me for a homosexual. 


I feel ashamed because I instinctively hesitate to answer people when they ask if I am a homosexual. 


Does anyone else panic if a stranger asks your orientation?
