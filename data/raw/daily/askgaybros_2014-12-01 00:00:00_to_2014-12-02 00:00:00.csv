It feels like I don't have as much strength in the muscles down there as I usually do... it's probably just some bruising or muscle soreness along with a hemorrhoid (I think, going by symptoms lists online), but I'd like to know others' opinions as well. There's no leaking blood or anything (touch wood), just soreness (which I originally mistook for DOMS from the gym), a slight itch and the aforementioned physical symptoms. 

I've decided to wait a day or two and see how it progresses before freaking out over it (I'm hoping it subsides easily, but knowing my luck that won't be the case). Is it worth going to my GP over (which I'd really rather not)? OTC creams or anything? Should I be worried? Assuming it's a hemorrhoid, would a single incident like this result in a recurring condition, or should it clear up and stay that way?

I _think_ it might have diminished in size a bit already, but I'm probably just being optimistic.

I'm **so** sorry for wall of text! Added a tl;dr on the end. Also sorry for any spelling or grammar mistakes, I'm not a native speaker or even resident in an english speaking country.

I'm 23, undergrad linguistics student at a university in the same city I've grown up in (the city's kind of small per my country's standards). I'm out to my parents and my only sibling along with basically everyone who cares (I almost don't act ""feminine"" at all, but won't really hide it if someone asks about my sexual orientation), and haven't had a bad reaction about it from anyone in the past few years, I believe mostly due to the fact that I can afford to avoid being around prejudiced people. I'm a bit introverted (but I don't see this as an issue by itself), just to the point I don't care much about what people say about me because I don't need so many people to like me to go on with my life. The problem is, even with my introversion, I'm still emotionally very needy, and sometimes my friends just won't fill the void caused by my needyness, with leads me to a never-ending search for a relationship.

So, during the last three years or so (started right after I came out to my parents. I believe it's also noteworthy that I've never been in a relationship that lasted more than two months), I started actively looking for dates constantly on Tinder and on and off Scruff and Hornet (those are the most popular apps around my region), in the hopes I would ultimately find a guy who would like to be in a relationship with me and vice versa. This has led me through a series of bad dates and almost-relationships gone bad due to lack of interest from either side (summing up, a great mass of disappointments), and ultimately a huge heap of self-doubt, making me think whether I'm too picky, too annoying, too clingy (which now I'm almost completely not at all), too whatever else there - and I always end up deciding the problem isn't me... But despite my absolute lack of experience with relationships and how they work and feel like, I have this really strong feeling that I need one to be absolutely happy - a few reasons for this that I came up with during therapy are: I feel this increasing need for having sex (my therapist says it's an age thing, but I know some of my friends don't feel this as much as I do, they can just go on for almost an year without it) while also needing the warmth of someone caring for me, and the fact that I absolutely hate myself every damn time I end up finding myself going out with a guy with the sole purpose of hooking up, mostly because I just end up getting back home and showering like if I were very, very, very dirty for being with someone I had never met before, and end up even feeling bad that I'm so tied to the society-imposed values that make me feel that way, and I'm also VERY scared of HIV and other STDs.

But now, enough of (probably) unnecessarily justifying myself and my need for a relationship. The real problem is: I simply can't be with people who like going out a lot. Going out and being with a big amount people I don't know very well is really exhausting to me - I get this kind of hangover from it and need to be alone for a day or so after a day of too much of this kind of social interaction - and this drives people who are more ""social"" away from me. This doesn't happen when I'm into someone or I'm around good friends tho, as I can be with them for days without this kind of effect on my mood. Because of this, it's really hard to find people who are like me to date (I've only found and tried dating a few introverts in my life, and almost none of them liked being around people they liked a lot, like I do, and I usually just broke up with them after I would realize that would include me even after being with them for a while). I know it's probably a little early in life to worry about this, but I'm scared shitless of being single for a very long portion of my life. It drives me crazy thinking about it and I have no idea how to fix it.

Again, I'm sorry for the wall of text - I get really carried away sometimes and write huge and prolix texts when I'm talking about this kind of thing.

Ok so recently my boyfriend and I turned our monogamous relationship into an open relationship. We both made grindrs, have met a few people, all is going well, etc. 

I never actually knew what his grindr was until a few hours ago. I was looking and found a familiar chest. Was no doubt his. I went to his profile and it said he was single, looking for dates, and friends, and that his headline was updated on the 8th. The 8th was long before we discussed an open relationship. 


Back in October I had him delete his grindr because I found out he was still using it and thought we agreed to delete it once we became exclusive, so he did. I found out he was using it and that he was active the day of. Claimed that one of his friends that's been trying to get into his pants told him to get on grindr so he could send him his test results to show he's clean.

I confronted him about the *new* account today, and he claimed that his friend had him create one to talk to him or something like that, but it just doesn't make any sense. He could have gotten his number, email, anything. Why grindr? And even besides that, why would he update his status saying ""Looking for friends for cool times hmu?"" if he's just on there to talk to a friend? 


His excuse is that he doesn't remember putting that there, and his excuse for the single status, and looking for dates is that he was just putting in random stuff for his account. He could have just left his profile completely blank though since he was just on there to supposedly talk to a friend. 


I really want to believe him but I feel like there's just no way I can. Everything seems to point to him lying to me. He knows I don't want him having a grindr so even if it was just to talk to his friend, why would he make one? 


It seems like he's coming up with a bunch of excuses. The first time I caught him on grindr and he said his friend was sending him test results, he could have sent that through text. I'm 100% sure of that because I know that that specific friend is on his contact list. And what are the odds that I would go onto grindr for the first time since we met, and find that he just so happened to log in that same day.


I just don't know what to believe. Even if I put all of this past me and believe him, there will always be doubt in the back of my mind. Can someone please give an outsiders perspective on this? I'm an emotional wreck right now.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huge wall of text inc.&lt;/p&gt;

I found out he was using it and that he was active the day of. Claimed that one of his friends that&amp;#39;s been trying to get into his pants told him to get on grindr so he could send him his test results to show he&amp;#39;s clean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I confronted him about the &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; account today, and he claimed that his friend had him create one to talk to him or something like that, but it just doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense. He could have gotten his number, email, anything. Why grindr? And even besides that, why would he update his status saying &amp;quot;Looking for friends for cool times hmu?&amp;quot; if he&amp;#39;s just on there to talk to a friend? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His excuse is that he doesn&amp;#39;t remember putting that there, and his excuse for the single status, and looking for dates is that he was just putting in random stuff for his account. He could have just left his profile completely blank though since he was just on there to supposedly talk to a friend. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really want to believe him but I feel like there&amp;#39;s just no way I can. Everything seems to point to him lying to me. He knows I don&amp;#39;t want him having a grindr so even if it was just to talk to his friend, why would he make one? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems like he&amp;#39;s coming up with a bunch of excuses. The first time I caught him on grindr and he said his friend was sending him test results, he could have sent that through text. I&amp;#39;m 100% sure of that because I know that that specific friend is on his contact list. And what are the odds that I would go onto grindr for the first time since we met, and find that he just so happened to log in that same day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just don&amp;#39;t know what to believe. Even if I put all of this past me and believe him, there will always be doubt in the back of my mind. Can someone please give an outsiders perspective on this? I&amp;#39;m an emotional wreck right now.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm 29 and in a serious relationship, living with my girlfriend for nearly a year now. We have a healthy relationship, sex 4/5 times a week but despite this i have reoccurring thoughts and feelings about a friend of mine.
He's an old friend my age who I lived with during college, he lives about 3 hours from me but comes to visit every few months for a few nights. He has never given me any indication he is gay although as long as I have known him I've never known him to have a sexual relationship with anyone and i'm not sure how he would react if i tell him i've been having sexual feeling towards him. 

I have no intention of cheating on my girlfriend either though so i'm not sure if there is any point confronting it but I've also believe the theory that if something like this is repressed it comes out worse int he long run.
Anyway, many times when i wank i think about him, I've never seen him fully nude so i don't know how bog is cock is or thick or if he is circumcised so I have a lot of curiosity about it. I regularly visit a pic of him on his facebook where some girl is pulling up his tshirt as the pic is taken and his jeans are a bit low(don't see any dick or even pubes). When he would come to visit me before I was living with my gf he would always sleep on the 2 seater couch in my room although I have offered to share the double bed with him(in a friendly platonic way).
When I wank thinking about him it isn't full sex, not sure if I would like to fuck him or he fuck me, often just about his chest or cock or the excitement of telling him how I feel. Maybe sucking or exploration, when I have invited him into my bed my fantasy would be more so lie together with close shamefulness more than just sex.

I don't feel hugely uncomfortable in possible telling him this as I'd trust him very much with personal stuff and i get the feeling he may be largely sexually repressed so i might not be far off the mark thinking he feels the same. He gets very uncomfortable talking about sexual relationships and has often referred to me over the years as a man slut cos id often bring women home when we would go out.

My only gay experience was when I was 12 or 13 with friend a 2 years older. We used to watch porn together and experiment. Mostly wanking together and each other. I don't think i ever sucked him but he did me, so full sex or anything.

I often get the idea to send him a message telling him some of this(mostly when i'm drinking) but not sure if it's a good idea. 
I ain't mentioned it to my girlfriend and a slight fear is that if i tell him he could tell her sometime he is pissed off with me...

any advice please.

We have two main ways of thinking, either the faster, impulsive, intuitive, but frequently faulty quick system that provides instantaneous feedback whether we like it or not, and the slower, more deliberate, system that takes a bit of work to figure out more complex problems.

When we see a picture of a guy on an online profile, or when we see someone out at a bar in real life, within a split second of observing their behavior and clothing, we form a near-complete opinion of who that person is and what their M.O. is. Twink, bear, slutty, emo, jerk, whatever. Instantaneously, we're either attracted or not. That's our first, quick, system of thinking.

Let's stop that way of looking at each other. Let's give each other more consideration. I know that you, yeah, you reading this now, have experienced being passed over without even a second look, and you *know* there's so much more to you.

Don't get me wrong, visceral physical attraction is certainly important in a mate, but here's how I think of it. In *every aspect* of our lives, we know that the more reflective manner of thinking is necessary just to avoid shooting ourselves in the foot.

You see that hot investment opportunity and lose all your money (because you skipped the due diligence), you get cut off by another driver and fly off the handle (because you didn't take a step back and take a deep breath or practice self-control), you stuff your mouth with way too much delicious Thanksgiving food (cause you didn't think ahead how you'll feel like crap for the rest of the day!).

So why do we summarily reject even one single date based on a single reactive impulse? Coffee ain't that expensive, just go talk with someone new!

We feel as though we're in control in selecting the ""perfect"" guy from OKCupid or Grindr, cause they appear almost unlimited, and so we keep looking. Well...

51% of the people in the world are guys. 5.1%ish are gay or some variant thereof. Pick an age range within 5 years on either side of yours, and we're probably down to roughly .7% of the population within your community is even eligible for consideration - like, just on an orientation and genitals basis.

So now, go ahead. Throw some variables into the mix. Easy-going personality, high salary, blonde, 8"" or more, but only cut. Just after one or two variables, you've literally not got a single match within 100 miles of you. It's quite possible that your match does not physically exist in your state with the small pool from which we have to select.

And this is the point. We need to be open to each other. We can't just be open to ""our type"". If you're single, you don't have a type. You won't know your type until you meet him, and figure out that he's somehow right for you.

This is pretty obviously borne out of personal frustration. Most recently turned down by an unemployed, unathletic, medium attractive guy because I wouldn't be naturally turned on by pretending to be his dad during sex. Oh, I don't mean we met and didn't click. We had decided to grab a coffee, and when he found out I didn't want to choke/hit/yell at him regularly during potential sex, he cancelled the first date.

I'm used to it. Not mad at this dude, but so sorry that he's literally doomed to a life of loneliness. His example sounds extreme, but we all do this all the time with our own silly criteria. We don't have to be that guy. Let's not be that guy. Let's be open to change, to flaws, to learning, to being wrong, to *compromise*.

Next time you have the chance, just go out with the guy. We need to get to know each other better.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, this is only a question in that it asks ourselves for self-reflection.&lt;/p&gt;

My and my boyfriend have been together for 3 years, he has lived with me for 11 months and we were friends since we were 18 (we met freshman year at college). We are both 26.

I want to end our relationship and ask him to move out. The sooner the better obviously but I don't want to rush him. His mother lives within 5 miles so I am assuming he would be going there.

Some background:
He hasn't done anything wrong, he is genuinely a decent person. This sounds like a cliche or a cop out but this time it's me and my own ""fault""
 
I miss sleeping alone in my own bed

I miss being able to eat dinner in my apartment naked on the couch watching jeopardy alone 

I miss smoking inside my own house when it's 5 degrees outside

I miss the whole reason I became self employed which was so I could keep the odd hours that I liked and not having to worry about being quiet between 11pm-6am weeknight because he has to work

I miss being able to not get shit for sleeping until 2pm on a Wednesday even though I work for myself and it doesn't matter when I sleep because I don't have to go to the office 

I miss being able to leave porn blaring on the compute monitor when I'm done and not having to explain it to anyone

I miss not having someone texting /calling to check up on me or wonder when I'll be home and who I'm with

I HATE that he stopped referring to my apartment as ""your condo"" and now as ""our house"" 

.....in short there is a whole bunch of things that I miss about being single and living alone, it's not anything he did and this would happen  to anyone. He is kind, decent, good looking and funny. He is laying asleep in my bed next to me while I type this and as much as I hate saying this, I find myself despising and resenting him. I don't want that because we have had great times, I wanna keep the nice memories and not create anymore. I have been feeling like this for awhile, but the past week has been it. I miss being alone. I would do anything to never hear his voice ever again as bad as that sounds.

I know I'm a horrible person, you don't have to remind me. 
How do I do this gently? I am meeting him by his office for lunch to tomorrow..I'm thinking I should pack his stuff before that and then break up with him at lunch. Bad idea? If not, how so? What should I say? I don't wanna be cruel because he has always been good to me and I think he will be surprised because he probably thinks everything is great...and it seems that way but I just don't wanna be part of an ""us"" or a ""we"" or an ""our"" anymore. I wanna do it tomorrow the quicker the better.

Please don't insult me and tell me how bad I am for breaking up with him. I already know trust me. He is a great guy. But tonight I almost snapped and told him to ""gtfo"" when I looked across MY kitchen table in MY condo and eating off of MY nice plates that were my nana's and he told me how he wanted to repair OUR kitchen.

I knew since I was like 14 that I'm too much of a solitary creature, too fiercely independent, and too possessive of what's mine (possessions, not people) that I wouldn't be able to handle a LTR. But he was such a good friend and so kind and loving that my judgement got clouded and I thought that my ""love"" (what I thought it was, actually it was lust and desperation for affection) would help me change. Well, I can't change and I want to dump him in the most mature and respectful way possible so that I don't ruin these years of happiness by losing my cool and going apeshit on him over my personal issues. 


We are 26 year old gay guys and we live in Westchester County, NY (NYC suburbs). I own my condo all by myself and since he moved in I still have insisted on paying for everything but I don't think any of that matters cause we aren't married thank god. 


Please offer me advice!! Thanks and have a good night.



**EDIT: My question is ""how is the nicest way to get him out?"" I know it's not going to be pleasant regardless but I don't want to crush his soul. Someone said wait until the weekend, but it is going to be very hard to look at him all week while inside I cannot wait until Friday to have my home back for myself because I am honestly so excited for that. Is there any nice way to do it tomorrow? Should I just do it in the morning so he can call in sick and move his stuff out??**","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am using a throwaway because he knows my username and also because I&amp;#39;m an active poster in other subs in which I have networked and this is nobody&amp;#39;s business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My and my boyfriend have been together for 3 years, he has lived with me for 11 months and we were friends since we were 18 (we met freshman year at college). We are both 26.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to end our relationship and ask him to move out. The sooner the better obviously but I don&amp;#39;t want to rush him. His mother lives within 5 miles so I am assuming he would be going there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some background:
He hasn&amp;#39;t done anything wrong, he is genuinely a decent person. This sounds like a cliche or a cop out but this time it&amp;#39;s me and my own &amp;quot;fault&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I miss sleeping alone in my own bed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I miss being able to eat dinner in my apartment naked on the couch watching jeopardy alone &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I miss smoking inside my own house when it&amp;#39;s 5 degrees outside&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I miss the whole reason I became self employed which was so I could keep the odd hours that I liked and not having to worry about being quiet between 11pm-6am weeknight because he has to work&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I miss being able to not get shit for sleeping until 2pm on a Wednesday even though I work for myself and it doesn&amp;#39;t matter when I sleep because I don&amp;#39;t have to go to the office &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I miss being able to leave porn blaring on the compute monitor when I&amp;#39;m done and not having to explain it to anyone&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I miss not having someone texting /calling to check up on me or wonder when I&amp;#39;ll be home and who I&amp;#39;m with&lt;/p&gt;

Sometime when i was 15 I read up online on jelqing techniques. I decided to give it a try for around 2 weeks and one day, as I did my usual exercises, I pulled down, heard a ""pop"" on my dick (which always happened). This time, immediately I lost my erection and I felt like as if my dick was ""disconnected"".

1 month passed by - started feeling depressed 

1 year - suicidal 

2 years - stopped thinking about it 

10 years, present day - still can't get an erection

Since then I haven't been able to achieve a full erection. That was 10 years ago.

I haven't seen a doctor back then because I was incredibly scared and didn't know who I could speak to. I figured that eventually with time, things will get better. But it didn't.

I can still jerk off and cum, but when it comes to penetration, I can't do it. The blood would fill up but i don't actually ""feel"" any hardness like before. Normally the prostate should feel firm but mine isn't. Almost immediately I lose the erection when stimulation stops.

I'm gay and I have hooked up with some men and bottomed. I feel incredible shame when guys start playing with my dick and I couldn't get hard. Because of this I just avoid hooking up and if I do, I make sure they have no social links to me. 

This really does affect my social life. I've hung out with some gay friends and there was a night when one of our regular game nights, out of the blue, progressed into group play between 4 friends. I had to hide and cry in the bathroom and then I made an excuse and left early and cried on the way home because I couldn't deal with confronting the situation. 

I was approached by one of them where they said they were sad I left because they really liked me, but I could never give a proper explanation because of the shame. These guys were not one night stands - they were friends and I could never bring myself to open up to that level. I lusted after them equally and that fact hurt even more. I've just stopped talking to them and cut them out after that night without giving a proper explanation and I still feel terrible to this day.

I'm already depressed to begin with as I have come from an abusive childhood. Since I've lost the ability to get erections, there's another layer of darkness that looms over my mind.

I'm completely unable to push myself to get into a relationship with anyone, because I know when ""that time"" comes, I could never bring myself to explain why I can't get hard and tell them because I used jelqing techniques to make my dick bigger. It's just being hit with shame after shame.

It has brought me down so much to the point that the depression has leaked into my social life and I'm starting to feel my mind being more and more clouded every waking day.

I have an appointment booked with a urologist in two weeks. 

This will be the first time I am seeing a professional about this but part of me feels hopeless....because after all, it has been 10 years already and if time doesn't heal a broken dick, I'm pretty much fucked.

sorry /r/gaybros for the rant. I just really needed vent and to be honest, I have not come across anyone my age online who literally broke their dick at the age of 15. I feel completely alone in all of this.

I am feeling a little lost in regards to who I am and feel like I have no one in my life to talk to about it so it is just stressing me out. I apologize for the long post, but just want to get it all out there so y'all can understand where I am coming from. 

I have always been very shy and insecure. Most of this stems from having a slightly deformed facial feature through most of elementary and junior high. I was teased a lot for this. In high school, I had surgery to correct it. Since my surgery many have told me I am extremely attractive but the many years of teasing still have their effect and still leave me very insecure. 

Due to these insecurities, I have always been shy around girls simply because I thought of myself as too unattractive or awkward to talk or flirt with ones I might have a crush on. Because of this, I never kissed anyone until I was 21 and am still a virgin (even in the strictest sense of the word). I've never had a serious girlfriend or even really a relationship. When I have tried in the past to pick up girls, I always get rejected and even smiling at them when passing on a street/in the hall gets me the bitch glare...obviously helping my self confidence. Most of the girls I have dated, I date for a few occasions before cutting it off usually because I don't feel a connection or see a real future. While on dates, nothing seemed to come natural, I always felt like I was going through motions and it never felt entirely comfortable. It always just felt like something I was expected to do. And now, being 25 when I date girls I am really insecure about the relationship progressing due to my sexual inexperience. 

I have always believed I was straight and was just waiting to meet the right girl for everything to click. However, despite this, I have always been a little bit curious about guys as well. If an attractive guy and woman are in a magazine ad, chances are I will notice the guy first before the girl. Recalling back to high school, I remember having ""crushes"" on attractive guys on tv, magazines, etc. By crush, I don't think I would necessarily call it sexual, I just liked looking at these guys. In college there were certain guys who I would facebook stalk that I thought were attractive and even today am constantly browsing the profiles of bodybuilders and what not on instagram. If I were to generalize, I would say I find more men attractive than women, for me only certain types of women (blonde with bigger boobs) extremely attractive.

When Tinder came out a little over a year ago, I used it initially on the straight setting. Matched with some girls, didn't really get anywhere with the mostly bitchy set on there and kind of gave up. One night, I decided to change the setting to ""seeking men"" just out of curiosity. I matched with quite a few guys right off the bat and unlike the girls I matched with these guys actually wanted to talk and get to know me and complimented me. I met a few really cool guys on there and really felt like we made good connections, connected like I never felt with girls. 

My ""crushes"" and experiences on tinder first made me really question my sexuality about a year ago, if perhaps I was gay or bi. However, this realization has lead to more confusion. Some of the guys I have met on Tinder I really like, find extremely attractive, and connect with very well. However, I don't feel much of a desire to have sex with them or anything, so does that make me not gay?
On the other end of the spectrum, I have always felt a little different from my guy friends. I have never been the stereotypical male ""horndog"" like most of my buddies, trying to get laid and chase after girls constantly. While I find many women attractive, I don't feel a strong desire to have sex with them either, however, would say the desire to do so is stronger than with men.

Being 25 and perpetually single, never dating is leading to my friends and family to start asking me what's up? Problem is, I don't even know.
