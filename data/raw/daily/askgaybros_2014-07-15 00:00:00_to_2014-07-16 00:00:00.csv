He lives and works in Charlotte. I split time between Charlotte and DC, and am away for work a fair amount, sometimes for as long as a month or months at a time.

**Definitions**: Acquaintance - someone you are friendly with and occasionally have lunch or a drink with in a group setting; Friend - someone you can text randomly on a Sunday afternoon and make plans with; Close friend - someone who'll hold your hair back while you puke

**Problem**: Whenever I'm gone (for longer than a couple of days), my bf gets depressed and moody, at least in part because he has no friends other than our cat. Both of us are kinda misanthropic, but I've managed to accumulate more friends than I know what to do with (although none in Charlotte), while he has been a loner (he wasn't a complete, complete loner in high school and had friends who he was close with - I've met some of them, they seemed very normal). He has some acquaintances from work who he might get lunch or drinks with, but that is as far as it goes.

I think he needs friends. It doesn't weird me out that he doesn't have them (if it did, I wouldn't have gotten with him), however he becomes so miserable when I am away and it is painful to watch, makes me feel guilty and frustrated because I feel powerless/don't know how to help, and just generally sucks for both of us.

I've mentioned this to him before, though I haven't dwelt on it because I don't want to make him feel self-conscious, and, also, I have no idea how friends happen - they just kind of do for me. I am fairly certain he is completely indifferent to having friends other than me and the cat, and I feel that if I made friends 'for him,' whatever that might mean, he would put in minimal effort into the relationship with them. He's not socially awkward or shy, at least as far as I can tell (if he's around my friends, he seems happy and they all like him), he just doesn't seem to care. 

**Questions**: How do I help him make friends? How do I help him want to make friends?

She wants me to speak to a religious counselor because she's not convinced that God can't ""heal"" me. However the worst part is that she won't let me talk to any other gays. Or apparently have gay friends. I think her reasoning was ""I can't let you be around people to will take you further into the gay lifestyle,"". I know her heart is in the right place &amp; that she's just scared, but it's still taking it's toll on me. 

So I wanted to ask you guys if any of you have had a similar situation to this, and have had crazy mood-swings after coming out to a parent? I've been swinging from suicidal ideation all the way to feeling on top of the world and plotting to resume chasing dick... then back again to a depressive state. 

Now, I do have clinical depression, ADHD, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder; and I'm on 300mg Wellbutrin XL, 20mg Lexapro, 30mg Adderall XR, and an Rx for a beta-blocker for anxiety. I know this could probably be influencing what I've been feeling lately, but I also know I'm not the only gaybro with mental health issues.

We've been together for almost 3 years now. He's talked about marriage and is generally very loving. I'm emotionally invested. He told  me he'll work on his anger issues and that he doesn't want our relationship to end.

I've been struggling somewhat academically this last year, and I really need all the help I can get.

I know coming out would allow me to tell a more unique story about myself, but I don't know if I'm ready. Would coming out really help my chances and should I do it?

However, I&amp;#39;m applying to law school and many applications have questions regarding sexual orientation. Some applications even ask for diversity statements under which LGBT status is mentioned. I never thought I would be asking about using my LGBT status to game the system and gain admission to a law school, but it is 100% true. I&amp;#39;ve been struggling somewhat academically this last year, and I really need all the help I can get. I mean, coming out would be telling the truth... but I don&amp;#39;t want to rush into this decision solely for personal gain. I know coming out would allow me to tell a more unique story about myself, but I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;m ready. Would coming out really help my chances and should I do it? I&amp;#39;m planning doing so eventually, but I never planned on doing it now. What should I do?&lt;/p&gt;

So as the title reads I'm having some troubles and it's been bothering me for a year or so now. I have a pretty strong atrraction (more than likely fuck buddies, we have pretty similar yet negative views on relationships) to one of my best friends. I'm not out yet either (bi but absolutely in love with the male body) which makes this awkward.  Anyways I really want to get with him but I'm not sure how to know for sure. 

Here are some clues that just have my mind in a jumble. When we were younger and just browsing the web or something. My hand was in the mouse and he just kissed it. There was a little but of context to that, but I can't remember the details. 

The next clue is that he is always touchy feely around me. I've tried to do the same a little bit and it's been slightly provoking so that's a plus right? But as an example of the touchy feely stuff, he's grabbed my thigh sometimes when he laughs. He'll touch my face when putting emphasis on something in a phrase. He'll kind of brush my face with his fingers as a playful way of saying ""no"" to a plan or something. I think that may be a Family Guy reference. And just last night he stroked with a couple of fingers my leg from the middle of my thigh to my knee. For no particular reason. And a couple times our feet and legs were touching and I didn't move them as a way to make these hints more obvious, but he didn't either for a bit. I know that last part isn't much but...

The final clues are verbal. When we were younger and he spent the night at my house I was getting up to switch out a video game and I swear he said ""you're hot."" I said what?! And he just kind of evaded it. You know how that goes. But also a while back he was talking about a paper that required you to describe the relationship to your roommate (more on that later) and he joked with me and said ""I didn't know what to put... bromance, soul mate, other half."" 

So the two big questions I have are: given these clues and hints, do you think he feels somewhat the same way? Because I think maybe these small hints are him trying to reach out. Or I could be completely wrong on that. The big thing here is he has stern opinions,  but is accepting of people as humans so he isn't judgemental. But if I were to do something and he wasn't ok with it, he'd let me know in an aggressive tone of voice (hard to explain I guess.

And I want to know what I should do to pursue this a little further and don't want to make things awkward for the both of us with such a reveal. We got an apartment together for college this fall so I don't want it to ruin anything or make him feel uncomfortable. But at the same time I see it as an opportunity I shouldn't pass up if I can help it. 

I also once thought of using an alcohol setting to get him to open up a little more but I don't drink much if at all and I find that method kind of unethical. I really just want to lean in for a kiss one day and see what his reaction is. 

So what do you think reddit? What should I do? If there is any information you guys might need I'll do what I can. I don't want to jeopardize a great friendship, but I think it can go a bit farther than that. 

Also, this is a throw away because he frequents reddit.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi guys.

Scruff lead to texting, texting lead to a date, a date lead to his place, and...well...you can guess the rest. He's really cute, older, great sense of humor, into me, and I really like him.

He went away for about a month, where we texted almost daily. Over text, he's really cute and goofy, but in person, he's pretty dry and somewhat difficult to connect with. He got back to town this past weekend, and last night I went to his place for drinks, which led to making out, which led to me spending the night. Between a couple of our sessions fooling around, he made a comment about us dating, which kind of caught me off guard.  
  
I've never had a boyfriend, and never dated two guys at the same time, so I'm not sure on protocol here. They both have traits I like and traits I don't. I like aspects of both of their personalities, and am attracted to both of them.  
  
So...what do I do here? How long do I pursue both of them before I have to make a choice? And when that happens, how do I do it without being a total prick? Even if I'm not romantically involved with them, they're both people I wouldn't mind being friends with.

My mother is a widow. What I notice more and more is that when my sister makes any plans involving us as a family, she never consults me at all. It seems like there's just this assumption that I have no life and nothing to do but be available for family functions when they're announced.

My sister is not overtly homophobic, but I still get the sense that she thinks that because she had children she's automatically better than me. She's made sure that there's some kind of wedge between me and my niece and nephew. You might suspect me of being paranoid, but there have been a few blowups where she's announced that she's cutting off contact with the rest of the family--and gets her kids to participate. She's destructive that way. I used to get along well with her kids, but now, though they're polite, they're not friendly.

Do any of the rest of the readers here every feel like you're taken for granted by your families or that your siblings with children use their children to give themselves more say in family matters, with the apparent attitude, ""I had children, so I did the right thing and you didn't""?

I have posted here before a few months ago about my relationship that ended, and things have been going well since then. My ex and I broke up last November and had been living together ever since. The breakup wasn't all that bad and we both agreed that we should not be together any longer, and we lived together peacefully until about the end of April. 

At the end of April we got into a huge tear-filled argument (one of our first arguments ever in 5 years) and he immediately moved out the next day. I'm not sure where he went to but I've hardly seen him since he moved out for longer than a few minutes. He comes and goes, gets a few things out of his room and leaves, etc, but still pays all of his bills on time. Since the argument months ago we have not spoken to each other. 

I came home and ran into him today and found that he now owns a gun. He tried to carry it concealed but I could clearly see the outline through his sheer shirt when he took off his jacket. 

There was no threat of violence in the argument we had, only the typical ""I don't trust you anymore"" break up words. Everyone knows that I would never harm anyone, and i feel the same about him, he would never harm anyone. We have even discussed the possibility of having a gun in the house a couple of years ago and we both decided not to approach owning a gun for safety reasons. We're not against guns, but since we have always lived in a safe gated community we decided to not get guns. 

I guess my point is that I definitely do not feel safe with him carrying a gun around me while we are still bitter at each other and not talking. Technically he is allowed to have the gun since he technically still lives here (our lease ends in September) but how should I approach this subject? Should I xpost this somewhere else?

I've come to the conclusion that I will be financially stable for the next two years of school, after that I am on my own. I do not want to go into medschool with debt and further myself into debt after medschool. I started working out a month ago and Im glad with the results that Ive seen so far. 

Question: Since I am stable for the next two years should I workout with the intent on becoming a stripper? Do you guys think I can have the body to be one if I keep up the workout? Have any of you ever worked as a stripper and do you regret it?
