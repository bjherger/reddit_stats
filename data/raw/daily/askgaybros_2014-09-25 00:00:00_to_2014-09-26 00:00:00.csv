I'd like to Thank you guys for this. 

I only posted one time on an old account(Lost Information) but It about how I felt not really ""gay"" but gay, didn't really know how to help that and was very conscious that I was a black guy generally into white bearish/stocky types so I expected failure before I even tried.

Well, I posted that about 4 months ago and had been trying to go out more and get the idea out of my head that you ""have to act a certain way to be gay"". I'd had been slightly out but I knew if I went out to bars and one of the local club events I'd run into people I know (mainly my sister's friends, friends of friends) that I hadn't really put myself out there with also afraid of how they might view me. 

Regardless, I went out when I could and just talked to different people. Some Gay, Bi, Drag queens etc. Whatever conversation I ended up having I just tried to not go into it with prejudgements of how gay I was being or they were being or whatever and quickly I got it through my dumbness that we're people first. Being gay doesn't define how my entire life is going to be panned out. So I actually became really comfortable to the point if I saw one of my sister's friend and they recognized me and they asked I wouldn't deny it. I just felt really good about being me. If it came up, I would just tell people instead of trying to bullshit with some machoness. It was actually uncomfortable to do that instead of just being honest.(Mom has known for awhile and I never had the discussion with my sister. Dad leaves out of town) The only thing that really kinda lingered with me is the whole being a black male who was gay.

WELL, Today that was eliminated and I feel great. I normally go with a girl friend of mine to the local drag show event that happens (College ID gets you in free so no reason not to) but she got sick so I decided I'd go by myself. I eyed this rather attractive/cool guy who seemed to be by himself but the luring ""I'm black he won't be into me"" started to creep in so I didn't go up to him or say anything even though he was close by during the show. After the show was over and the dance floor opened up I saw him dancing, told myself to stop being a fool and just try you'll never know. I walked over in the general area not even sure what to say and our eyes and met, I smiled he smiled back and we actually danced with the group around us had fun and had small talk(as much as you can over loud music). He ended up having to go due to his taxi being there soon so ended up walking out the exit. Well since I felt like it was now or never I ended up walking out as well 3 mins later and before I went to my car asked if I could get his number/talk and such and he said yes:D

I'm just so happy with myself that I went from being extremely uncomfortable to being able to actually do that today. I would of never been able to do that months ago. I didn't even feel like I was gay or black or anything going home, I just felt like me. Even if me getting his number doesn't pan out or whatever, It just changed how I view myself. 

I don't know, I just wanted to thank you guys not even for the responses to my post but for helping out people in general on this subreddit cause just reading the problems people have put it in my head that we are just people at the end of the day.

I am a 23-year-old male and I am beginnig to think I have fallen in love with my straight male best friend. Let's call him Chris. I have always identified as straight, and to this point have only had relationships with girls. I have always suspected that I am not 100% straight, because I like looking at dudes just as much, if not more than girls. So I guess I'm bi. That's really hard for me to admit as a Christian, but I'm still coming to terms with it and figuring out what that means. I'm not sure I can live with myself if that's really true, but I guess I have to figure that out.

Back to Chris. I met him going into my sophomore year of college (4-5 years ago). We hit it off pretty quickly but I didn't get close with him until a few months ago. It was at a friend's birthday party, and the two of us stayed up until 6am, way past anyone else, just talking. Unfortunately, this meant that all the beds were taken. However, he had brought a sleeping bag and suggested we share it. I was just going to sleep on the couch outside but he insisted I come in and sleep with him. I was drunk at the time so I conceded. It was really cold inside so he told me I should cuddle to stay warm. So that was the first time we spooned (I was big sppon). I was careful not to let my groin touch his ass or anything though. I didnt think much of it at the time, as it wasnt the first time I was forced to cuddle with another dude for warmth, but I did like it.

We have only grown closer since then. He is such a nice guy and always tells me how awesome he thinks I am. He says I am a straight badass compared to when I first met him and that I'm at the top of his tier list of friends. Basically, he always showers me with compliments. He is also very affectionate and touchy-feely, and even more-so when drunk. He is constantly soliciting me for hugs, and sometimes won't let me go at the natural point to do so. One time, I was even washing dishes when he came up and hugged me from behind, resting his head on my shoulder. Another time, when we were watching a movie with a bunch of friends, he put his arm around me for the entire movie, in front of all our friends. A picture was taken and we caught some hell for it, but it's whatever. At one point during the movie, he kissed the back of my neck, which is probably the strongest move he's made. It caught me really off-guard, but I'm trying not to think too much about that since he was pretty inebriated at the time (though definitely still lucid).

Whenever we're at parties, we always end up spooning together one way or another, whether it's in a bed or on the floor. I'm always big spoon. This has happened about seven or eight times now. Almost each time, I have made one additional move, such as actually hugging him while spooning, intertwining our legs, resting my head on his chest/shoulder, etc. I always wake up before him and usually reluctantly leave, but go about business as usual. 

However, one of our friends always manages to get a photo of us cuddling and posts it in our group chat on Facebook. Some of our friends straight up ask why we're acting like ""faggots"", and others say they wish they had a friend as close as we are. The thing is, Chris usually owns it and just tells everyone they're jealous of our relationship. He usually acts proud of our spooning sessions, though I have seen him act embarrassed when someone calls us out, saying something like, ""Yeah, like the time you woke up balls-deep in Chris?"" It doesn't really bother me, but I think it may embarrass him a little.

I think I was thinking I had never had a friend of the same gender who was as good a guy and as good a friend as he was, and that we just had what people like to call a ""bromance"" these days. I think that's how a lot of people see our friendship too. I didn't realize my feelings were deeper though until a couple weeks ago when he drove out to Indiana for a job interview (about 6 hours away from where we live). Even though I wanted to be happy for and support him, I was upset all day. As soon as I got home from work, I locked myself in my bedroom and cried my eyes out. I have not cried over a person since high school. In fact, I can't even remember the last time I cried before that. I just can't bear the thought of him leaving. After that, I knew what I feel for him had to be more than bromantic. I don't think he is getting that job now, but it may only be a matter of time before opportunity knocks for him.

The only other real development is when I suggested he come with me to Morristown to visit some mutual friends of ours. At first he said he couldn't afford it, but changed his midn after a day or so. On the drive up there, I worked up the courage to say, ""I love you, bro."" This wasn't meant to be a confession of romantic feelings, but more to let him know that I really do care about him on a deep level. He asked that I repeat what I said. Then we fist bumped and he said, ""I love you too buddy"".

The thing is, other than his actions toward me, I am almost certain that he considers himself to be 100% straight. Out of all my friends, he has gotten the most action with girls. I believe he has been with about a dozen women. I, myself, am still a virgin for religious reasons, but that's neither here nor there. He posts pictures of hot girls all the time (which I too enjoy), and he is actively trying to find a girlfriend. But hey, so am I.

I have never felt this way about anyone before honestly, male or female. Sometimes, I think it may just be an infatuation because I am hardly ever shown the same kindness and physical affection that he has shown me. For all I know, my feelings for him are just a phase and I'm not bisexual at all. It's just that this doesn't feel like friendship; it's more. I know he really likes me as a person and as a friend too, but I doubt he feels as strongly as I do.

I am going to his place to spend the weekend with him in a couple weekends, and I am hoping things progress there, but who knows what will happen. I will enjoy my time with him regardless.

Can anyone help me work through my feelings or thought processes on this matter? What do you think about Chris's behavior? I think he might just be too affectionate for his own good. I don't want to tell him how I feel and ruin our friendship, of course. But I can't just keep these feelings inside forever, either. Do you think he could feel the same about me, based on what I've said? Do you think maybe I'm just infatuated and I'll come to my senses eventually? What should I do? Please, I can't talk to anyone I trust about this, so I would greatly appreciate any thoughts I could get on this (and no insults/stupid comments, please). Is there a better Reddit to ask about this? (I found this one while googling for others in similar situations)

Thanks,
Scott

I'm his second boyfriend. His first was in high school for only like six months or something. From what I saw on fb and stuff the ex is in a long-term relationship and moved to a nearby state. 

He recently friended his ex on facebook. From what I heard from his best friend, it wasn't a good relationship and they didn't end in good terms, so  I thought it was weird. 

I asked him and he said the guy requested him, as I thought, and he even showed me the facebook chat. It wasn't really anything. The guy seemed to want to reconnect and my boyfriend was just making conversation. He wasn't all too worried, just weirded out that I asked. I felt better asking. 

Yesterday a guy from his track team posted a pretty good drawing of my boyfriend to his facebook. To my knowledge, the guy is straight just kind of open and free-spirited. At first I was kind of off-put about it. Does the guy admire him? Go fanboy? or does he have a mild crush on him? idk. I want to ask, but reasonably it's probably nothing. 

Should I ask or just put it off as something in my head about being insecure? Asking about it kind of makes me feel more secure, but still.

He's always busy and doesn't text me often during the day, it weirds me out other people are seeking his attention.

I'm going to try to keep this as short and simple as possible...

So I've been seeing this guy I met on a dating app for four months now. When we first got together we agreed to keep things casual. We have talked a couple of times about if we are seeing anyone else, just to be upfront with each other for health reasons, and neither of us are. The thing is that I find when we spend time together (multiple times a week) it feels like something more than casually dating. Since it is casual,  I find myself browsing the dating app, but not really looking for anyone because I am happy with the guy I'm with. My issue is that I see him on there (which I know, I'm on it too) and I get jealous and a little insecure about the whole thing...

Do I bring it up? If so, how? I would like it to be more, but I don't want to push him away if he doesn't feel the same...","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys! I&amp;#39;m going to try to keep this as short and simple as possible...&lt;/p&gt;

My sister, having no idea what my sexuality is, tries to set me up with her.  Everytime she brought her up I nudge, and just tried to get her every hint that I-am-not-interested.  So she decided, without me knowing, to tell the girl about me and my sister keeps telling me about how happy she would be to meet me and all.  I said ""ok"", shrugged, moved on, because I knew what she was trying to do, was set me up with her.

So, a few weeks go by and my sister gives me her number, she keeps telling me how the girl wants to meet me and all the jazz.  So, she keeps bothering me ""did you text her yet?"" over a span of two weeks until I gave in and texted her.  Now, I kinda felt bad that I wasn't texting her at first, because she might've been sad and upset if I hadn't.  So, I went in and decided to text her.

So, we exchanged and broke the ice via text.  Here's where the problem is---

She wants me to go to town with her and her best friend (whose a girl) and her boyfriend this Saturday.  So it's me, her, her friend, and her friend's boyfriend.  The boyfriend in question happens to be a class mate of mine at school.  I wouldn't call him a ""homophobe"" pursue, but he is very gossipy.  If he ever heard any ""juicy"" news about someone, it would spread all over the school before you knew it.  

This is what I'm afraid of-- I'm just afraid when we hang out with her friends, they may question why I never hitted on her or maybe kissed her.  I can't say because I wasn't interested, because, to be honest, she's a very pretty girl, no way a straight guy would say no to her (even I can see that).  

I've been told by my classmate that she's never had a boyfriend before and that she's clean (a virgin).  So I'm like ""oh..."".  I say that, because I don't want to give her the wrong signal and play on her emotions, since, in her mind, she will be thinking ""oh my god this guy is so awesome, I hope he be's my bf. :)""  I mean, I'm not flattering myself, I'm just probably stating a possible scenario.  Anyways, I won't find her sexually attractive, and I don't want to pretend, just to keep my secret from the school.  But, how do I tell her that from the beginning?  If I tell her, she'll tell her best friend, and her best friend will most likely tell her boyfriend who will then tell the whole school.  If I don't tell her, she'll be a little upset that I'm not ""getting onto her"" and might find me as a douche.  Now, that's not the kind of reputation I want to be in.  Don't get me wrong, I'm all for being friends with girls and she's no exception, but I feel like I have to tell her at first, otherwise she might get upset.  I don't want to live a lie, but at the same time, don't want my truth to be out.

But it seems like either mine is abnormally low or I just happen to keep getting with guys who take forever to cum. I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;m bad at blowjobs, or at least I&amp;#39;ve been told I know what I&amp;#39;m doing. But I&amp;#39;ve never been able to make anyone cum with them.

Let's just say...I've not had the best batting average with guys in the dating scene. I've known I'm gay for a very long time... probably since the first time I typed 'male sex' in google when I was 13, trying to find porn for the first time. That's a topic for a different time though... I've had my fair share of sex and crushes along the way, but when it comes to the dating scene... It seems like Crohn's Disease is the conversation stopper and deal breaker. Those willing to talk to me, immediately run when I tell them. Neither willing to deal or try to coexist. So I'm hoping this will either open the eyes to those kind of guys, or help bring insight to other guy's in the same boat I am. 

When do/did you bring up the topic of Crohn's with someone you enjoy spending time with or your SO? How did they take the news? Is it something you find most people aren't willing to deal with or are willing to understand? When something happens and your not able to go out as planned, what's the best way to tell someone you can't make it? When it comes to sex, is being a bottom safe? (I'd ask my doc about this question, though I'd like to get your perspectives on this too.) What drives me crazy is when I'm talking with someone, and all they want to do is bring up the topic of Crohn's or make sure I'm alright or trying to make sure I don't hurt myself etc.. How do you tell these type of people that you're okay, and the thought counts, but the act is driving me insane?

I haven't dealt with a lot of heavy problems yet. I had an abscess that grew on my colon that took a drain and a lot of healing time to fix. (Almost a 1 year of healing after the drain was removed) I couldn't imagine an SO wanting to to stick around and have to deal with something like that, let alone the retched thoughts of a colectomy bag.. which I hope to never have. I'm in remission now, and have been for about 5 months! So living everyday like I don't have Crohn's is a wonderful feeling!

I am out to most everyone that know's me, though I don't flaunt it. So don't expect to know that I'm gay as I walk by. Whenever I'm starting to like a guy I tend to like to take things slow, and get to know someone, before jumping into their pants. So the Crohn's conversation is pretty far down the lines for me. Though when I feel like I can, 9/10 times I bring up the fact that I have crohn's he will: A.) Stop talking to me. B.) Start talking in smaller sentences to the point of one word responses the rest of the night, then stop talking to me all together. C.) Say he's had an experience with another guy that had it and then will stop talking. 

So I don't know if I should just give up, stop telling people, or just deal with rejection and keep moving on? I'm curious from any SO's what your thoughts are too? How did your view on him change after he told you? Has any particular circumstances changed your relationship? Better or for worse?

I'm 25, and I feel like I'm missing out on an important time in my life. It's a shitty (and long-winded) topic to talk about, but I have no one else to turn to and ask :/

He is my age, well established in his career, kinda nerdy (which I find super attractive), and overall just a great guy. We have been talking for two months now. 

We went on two dates and to be honest we have both been enjoying each others company. We live 40 minutes form each other so we don't get to see each other every day, but we have talked every day for the last two months (mostly via text, but now we are getting into skyping). The one thing we haven't really talked about though is sex. It's come up a bit, but nothing too deep, which we both seem to be OK with. To be honest, I want to continue seeing him as we have a ton in common and he's just a really sweet guy. I'm just kind of curious as to when you other guys in relationships have started to seriously discuss this with your guy.

We aren't official yet, but to be honest, I can see myself in a serious relationship with this dude, but I don't want to jump the gun either. Right now I am enjoying what we have. And he seems to be as well.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, I have been playing the dating game for a bit now, and I met this guy on OKCupid. He is my age, well established in his career, kinda nerdy (which I find super attractive), and overall just a great guy. We have been talking for two months now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went on two dates and to be honest we have both been enjoying each others company. We live 40 minutes form each other so we don&amp;#39;t get to see each other every day, but we have talked every day for the last two months (mostly via text, but now we are getting into skyping). The one thing we haven&amp;#39;t really talked about though is sex. It&amp;#39;s come up a bit, but nothing too deep, which we both seem to be OK with. To be honest, I want to continue seeing him as we have a ton in common and he&amp;#39;s just a really sweet guy. I&amp;#39;m just kind of curious as to when you other guys in relationships have started to seriously discuss this with your guy.&lt;/p&gt;

Like I'm pretty sure I'm going to marry this guy. Here's the kicker, it's only been like a month. I know, I know.. I'm probably delusional. Neither of us have been in a relationship the way we know ours to be now. We've talked a ton about guys we've dated in the past and just in general how much more awkward and comfortable we are around each other. Nothing feels forced and it's been fun experimenting with each other and laughing at the awkwardness of figuring out each others bodies.  

Here's my real question bros: HE'S TICKLISH AS FUCK. How do I get more creative with kissing/touching without making him squirm and giggle like tickle me fucking Elmo? I've tried light and slow, quick with more pressure and everything in between. I mean, it was kind of cute how sensitive he is, but I feel like it's limiting my creative abilities. 

Are you or have you been with anyone super ticklish? And how do you like to be touched or from your experience how do I go about this?

TLDR: Boyfriend is HELLA ticklish and I can barely touch/kiss him anywhere but his face without him squirming away.

I have a brother who is also gay and they did not take it well when he came out 3 years ago. He did make their life hell, using the fact that he's gay to think he can do whatever, staying out until 4am on a weeknight during school. They're better about it now, but they still tell me every now and then that they're depending on me for grandchildren. I have no clue how to break it to them that I'm gay since they had this idea of the life they wanted for me, and I'm going against it. 

We're the only children my parents have, and they've instilled the idea in us since we were little that we need to carry on the family name since we're the only children on my father's side of the family. I do want children one day, but I guess they won't be biological since I'll most likely be adopting.

Maybe they already know, maybe they don't, I accidentally used my debit card at a gay club, and my mom stalks that like no tomorrow. I'm more ""masculine"" than my brother, he's quite a queen, while I am not, so I pull off being straight easily.  Being in my senior year of college, it's difficult to not tell them, but I don't want to break their hearts, or be disowned...
