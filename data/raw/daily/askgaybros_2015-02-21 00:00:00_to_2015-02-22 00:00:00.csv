Sorry for the wall of text.

I was chatting to a guy online. In his 30s, muscular, some tattoos. The first thing I think is 'he's too handsome to be true'. Besides his looks, he makes excuses for being too busy to meet up. He's working Saturday, he's busy Sunday, he had a motorbike accident last night. I'm thinking, this guy isn't real. But I persevered. Finally, he agrees to meet me. 

Today I went to the city. We arranged to meet on a busy street corner. I got there early, so I logged online. He is always online, so I can see he's close and getting closer from the GPS. When he shows up almost on time, he looks just like his picture. We got a hamburger, and I notice he is incredibly confident and blunt. He asked the guy serving us at Grill'd if he could get his hat. Then he messaged some 'supplier' friend of his to arrange getting a similar hat of his own. Anyway, I figure he's just quirky. He gets a drink and burps loudly, eats and gets food all over his beard. These things kinda turn me on to tell the truth, so I was smiling. He told me that I was handsome, and I returned the compliment. He asked if I wanted to be friends. He wasn't giving off a friends vibe with his smile, so I said sure, but can we be the kind of friends who kiss. He said no, because he is HIV positive. This is a bit of a shock to me, but I don't think my face registered any surprise. I've read about HIV, and know how to minimise my risk contracting the disease. So I suggest we get a DVD and head back to his place. 

We both drove, so we took his car. He drove like a maniac. While traveling through the car park he's going around 60kmph around tight corners. He swears, beeps, road rage. I'm pretty nervous and ask him to slow down. He did a little, but couldn't understand my anxiety. While driving he points out a pizza place and tells me he is considering buying it. He is an optometrist, but apparently he was once also a chef. Wow, he's been a lot of things. We pull into his house, he tells me he has a 9 year old son who lives in Europe. He is by this stage one of the strangest guys I've ever gone home with.

We get back to his place, he goes to the bathroom and comes back in his underwear. He is impressive, just like his pictures. He's constantly texting, but he puts his phone down. We fooled around. I was a bit hesitant to suck his dick, but I did. He then tried to 'tease' my bum with his bare cock, and I stopped him. He said he wouldn't put it in without a condom, but still I wasn't comfortable with that. We went back to fooling around and he spat in my mouth. Again, this is something I've seen a lot of in porn and I think it's hot. But I couldn't stay hard. Things slow down, we put on a dvd, neither one of us came. He started telling me that he's a 'hunter', and that he likes guys he can't have. That he's not looking for a relationship, that he wants a guy who is currently in a relationship with someone else. 

He puts his arm around my shoulder, and starts picking a pimple on my arm. I ask him to stop. He then asks me if I'm on steroids, because I have pimples on my back. This really is a sore point for me. I do have some pimples, but I don't think they are that bad.  Still I am self conscious about them. I started getting dressed. He was upset, but I asked to be taken back to my car. He tells me that I'm smart, handsome, and shouldn't worry about my skin. He was only asking because I'm muscular and the pimples would make sense. Anyway, he could have been a real prick and not driven me back to my car. My phone was dead, and my car was in a secure car parking lot he uses for work. Which was undoubtedly stupid of me. 

I know what I did was risky, he could have held my car ransom. What would you have done? Did I overreact? ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#39;t so much a question, but sharing an experience I had this evening. Sorry for the wall of text.&lt;/p&gt;

Now for some details...

I'm VERY kinky. About a year ago, I finally got involved with BDSM... Master and slave type stuff. About 5 months ago, I found ""my"" Master. The thing is, he's 11 years older than me, and married to another man (my ""Sir""). 

Now, if any of you have any experience with D/s type relationships.. They're very intense, and can be extremely emotionally fulfilling and rewarding. A longtime pet of mine died a week ago, and I called my Master and cried to him, and he provided support/care. It's a STRONG relationship.. and I feel the same way with his husband... But it's not romantic. There's a lot of love... but there's no romance. They're not my boyfriends. They're married, and I'm their sub. They've briefly mentioned that my moving in with them and being a full time sub is something they could be interested in some day... but they don't want to have that conversation for YEARS, because I'm young... and am not working with enough information that that's a call I'm sure I can make right now. 

I think the thing that's freaking me out, is that they met when they were both 22. They moved into together after dating for two weeks. I know this isn't the norm, but they were younger than me when they found the person they wanted to be with forever, and it's worked out SO well, and here I am.... not even looking. 

I find that dating would conflict too much with my relationship with them. I'm in chastity for them. I may not be ""in love"" but I AM involved in another loving relationship. Another very intense, trust based relationship. I feel like the number of guys that could accept that is insanely low, and it's not like I can even really blame them. In a lot of ways, this D/s relationship is more intense than any romantic relationship I've been in... and that's no something that's going to feel good for any partner.

Basically... I'm okay with not dating right now though. I'm not lonely. I'm getting love. I'm extremely happy. But am I missing a critical window here in any way? By not dating now.... Am I shooting myself in the foot later? I DO want a husband some day. Preferably a kinky one, but... I do want someone to be romantically... in love with, eventually. Whether that's someone I haven't met yet or my Master and Sir, should they decide to let me into their house permanently and open their relationship to me... or someone I already know, or whatever. I want romance, but don't NEED it now.... But is now the time to be finding it... like these two guys I'm subbing for did?

**TL;DR: Kinky as hell. Sub for two doms. Not looking for love RIGHT NOW as I'm emotionally satisfied, but I'm older than they were when they found each other, and I want to fall in love with someone at some point.

Throwaway account for a couple reasons. needing some advice and hope you can offer a little guidance. I've been seeing this new guy for about a month now. We haven't discussed being exclusive however I have not seen or had sex with anyone else. I do not know If he has been doing the same. Recently I went to the doctor and found out today test results show I have cyhlmidia. 

My problem is that I am not sure where I contracted the infection. I've filled my prescription and have taken the prescribed anti biotic. I've had relations with two people since my previous test(test before most recent) one in December which was a casual vacation hook up and the other the guy I'm currently seeing. I practiced unprotected oral sex with both(dumb I know). It's possible and seems most likely that I contracted it from the new guy. However it's also possible I just didn't show symptoms until recently and contracted it back in December. My problem is I'm really nervous and scared to tell the new guy. I know I have to. I'm just not sure how to broach the subject. I don't want  him to see me as a gross person who possibly infected him with an std. I've never had an STD before and really just have no experience in dealing wth something like this. I really like this new guy and want to make sure I handle this in the right way. It's also possible he gave it to me. However I know making accusations isn't usually a good idea.

**My question is this**: do you up or downvote when you see reddit boobs? Why?

It seems the whole reason for that particular subreddit is for either punishing or rewarding our curiosity, but topics of gore, mutilation, and other shocks are still upvoted, regardless of vulgarity – normal gay sex is not any where near as vulgar let alone a humour comic. 

Although I do not actively search for straight sex (full on homosex here), I don't downvote boobs or vaginae if ever I come across them. 

Here's my reason: I think that if gays downvote straight sex, and vise versa, gays will always lose the fight because we're biostatistically outnumbered. Also, who am I to say that you can't enjoy a woman's body just because I can't? I think it's completely unreasonable to downvote gay sex there just because you can't enjoy it personally.

In the end, I think it's because homosexuals are constantly surrounded, and even comfortable with the existence, of heterosexual culture, including it's sex, whereas the heterosexual population is not accustomed to the homosexual affection; it's because gays are desensitised to straights.

In late January, I had a hookup with a guy I met on Jack'd. We had sex which included oral (unprotected), anal (protected) sex but had anal teasing with his penis (unprotected). 

About 2 weeks later, I tested positive for oral and anal gonorrhea and was successfully treated (the same strain for both). I had asked him earlier when he was tested and he said that he had been tested 2 months prior and was negative for everything (all STDs and HIV). I asked him if he had any partners since then and he told me no. I had not had any partners either. I went through all the guilt already and understood that I made a mistake that I intend to never make again.

I am more concerned about potential exposure to HIV (assuming he's lying, worst case scenario) due to the anal teasing. After notifying him of my positive status with respect to gonorrhea he subsequently was tested for all STDs and HIV and told me he is negative (which I believe he is lying, or I should assume he is). Since he did have some precum, albeit not much, I assume that my risk is very low and I shouldn't be worrying?

Here's a little background, I'm 26 and I got out of a long [1.5 year] relationship about 4 months ago. I met this guy ""J"" [32] through OKC and we hit it off. Along the course of our texts getting to know each other, he sends me his profile at the university he works in. When I read his published articles in several reputable scientific journals, the universities he's taught/done research in, and his CV, I felt like a proverbial duncest. Further, he's an editor for a satirical magazine that he's just sold but still works and still writes for. 

Here's a little bit about me: I work 4 different jobs. I teach yoga and have several clients, work at a law firm as an IT analyst for my 9-5, route set at several climbing gyms (and teach new climbers the basics of rock climbing/bouldering), and I moonlight as a tattoo artist. Granted I graduated college, but I've focused more of having adventures, traveling a lot and establishing myself in New York (finding more loyal clients). No, I don't have self-esteem issues, but when I compare the things we've done and accomplished, there's really not much I can claim. 

He knows all this, but as I read more and more about his accolades, I feel less and less confident about what to talk about since I'm pretty sure I can't match him on an intellectual level.In fact as I write this, I feel like calling tomorrow's date off just to spare him. 

So bros, have you ever been in this situation? If so, what did you do and what can I expect. Is it safe to just call it off now and spare him from coming to the city, especially in this cold weather?

Thanks,

I'm really worried that she has STD's though.  I was recently was tested for everything except herpes and came back clean.  I just got an IGG Herpes test for type 1 and 2.  The results should be back on Wednesday.

If I did not really have any blisters, is it unlikely I have herpes?  I'm really worried.  Also, it is about 13 weeks from when we had sex.  Is that sufficient for an IGG test, or should I have waited 16 weeks?

Thanks!
