How are you all? Got a story to share. Tell me what you think of it.

(I'm not from the US. So I'll probably not bother you with the places involved in my story.)


I haven't been on the dating scene for two years. Recently I've dated a guy on Tinder which didn't work out. I've finally given in to my friends bugging me to try Grindr. I'm 23 already, and I guess it was time to have some good, clean fun. I was on vacation when I installed it. So far I've had one hook-up which was amazing, and a lot of guys bugging me for other pics and them not giving me theirs.

Then I met this guy. He was one of those faceless guys on the app. He just wanted to meet up. I was traveling alone, so I had to be careful. So I set to meet him on one of the the beautiful historical streets in the area. It was already a bit after midnight, and no one's on the streets except the occasional patrols and the few drunken people from the nearby pub.

I had already walked around a bit when I see this guy take a seat on one of the benches. It was him. We had our introductions and such. He was this very discreet guy since he was some sort of local celebrity in the area. He was on a rush, too, since he had to take the 1:30am bus to our country's capital (where I live) since he had a job interview there. Our conversation was really interesting. It seemed that he was really into me - even asking me if I was somebody who's fun to be in a relationship with. This flirting between us went on throughout the time we were together. We talked about our jobs, the stuff we like, and even our exes. We didn't even notice that he already missed his bus. He brushed it off, saying he can take the 2:30 one instead.

At this point I was already lost in the moment with him. Like, damn. This guy is something! I was enjoying our conversation so much that I never bothered telling him the truth that I was traveling alone. We finally finished our chat, held hands for a bit as he walked me to the hotel. There was this awkward moment as we looked at each other and tried to read each other if we wanted to kiss. But nope, we just gave each other a bro-fist. (I know, dang.) I got his number, he took a selfie of us, and we said our goodbyes. He also mentioned that he'll be in a theater act on January in the capital. As he walked away, I just stood outside waiting for him to look back, which he did.

We texted a couple of hours after. But I got to sleepy already that I had to say good night to him, telling him that our conversation was one of the best ones I've had in a long time. He promised to send our picture via Facebook and asked my name there.

Here's the problem. He never replied to my messages the next day. I've  tried contacting him on Facebook, but he didn't reply, too. 

Bros, I don't know what happened wrong. It's almost a week after this happened and I've been a mess. I can't believe this guy got into my head so much that it's driving me crazy. 

What do you think? Was this some sort of conversation one-night stand? lol. 

And right now my mind has been bugging me to return to that place soon. It's a 10-12 hour bus ride, and I can easily schedule a trip there since I've got a flexible work schedule.

I gave up on messaging him.

Or should I wait for January to arrive and go to that play he mentioned? I'd have to search the venue, though, since the it hasn't been finalized yet.

There's also this option of just letting it go and wait for the slim chance of us seeing each other again.

**tl;dr I had this two-hour conversation with the most amazing guy I've met, but no communication happened after that and now I'm a mess not knowing what to do.**

I'm not the overly effeminate type, though I crank up the gay accent (lispless) when I'm nervous. But I'm not much of a bro. I was terrible at group sports for the most part and I usually lack the grit to get extremely good at things like running or lifting. I try but alas fail. Ok so anyways the problem is that I find myself wishing I were straight. I'm from the deep south and I have to keep the gay to myself here for a few reasons, but I recently did some traveling for a bit and after catching up with friends and stuff, this time much more open than I have ever been about my sexuality, I found myself really questioning if I'm really gay. I guess I'm afraid that once I get involved with someone else (have not even kissed anyone), I will be locked into a gay box. I mean my affinity for gay porn and cute, smart, and/or sexy dudes is kinda gay i must admit. But today I just found myself remembering some of the middle age men I've met and how they have sex with their wives and have kids and are all normal and I really want that. I know it's terrible. Imagine what it's like to be inside my head. And then the other thing is that I see silly, stupid bros on youtube and all the things they can get away with that would be homoerotic to me and I'm really jealous. This really may stem from not having enough male friends and now friends in general around whom I feel comfortable. So I guess my question is have you guys had to deal with really not wanting to be gay and how did you get used to it once you finally accepted it? (I thought I had but relapsed like whoa as of late.

I finally admitted to myself I was gay in high school after I fucked a dude in the school parking lot. I looked forward to a new chapter in life after graduating where I was going to be myself. I looked forward to meeting men like myself and thought it's wouldn't be a problem. I think back and realize how stupid I was. 

Been on many dates with guys at the bar and on the apps to realize you are chastised in gay life for not identifying with what society considered the norm for gay life. I work on cars. I watch sports. I listen to classic rock. Been told I was too old, too fat and that I needed to get down to a 28 inch waist. Dragged to a NYC gay pride parade and was embarrassed to see what I saw...mainly naked gays who flaunt their alcohol problems and jock straps while dancing in foam. Got gasps of disgust when I said I didn't like Lady Gaga. Been around guys that only dated married men because they didn't want any kind of commitment. Been around men that insist on bareback only. 

I'm jaded, anxious, and easily manipulated. Months ago I discovered reddit and the red pill. Seriously I bought into it and then weeks later I realized what a farce it was. It's just a pathetic scheme to take advantage of insecure unhappy guys who hate themselves and everybody else. People like me. So I don't buy into that shit anymore and this username is an artifact.

Anyway it's reassuring to see that gay guys can be just as p(r)etty, vain, stupid, catty, vindictive, defensive, cruel, ageist, materialistic, superficial, self-loathing, and irresponsible as the rest of us. Reading comments in /r/ainbow about transgender people being offended at transphobic things and everyone else telling them they are wrong reminded me of how Republicans fight amongst themselves! Hysterical. like the legions of shrill seekers out there looking to tear down everything that doesn’t compute with their worldview, some of them, in fact, are as rigid in their standards of social justice and self-righteousness as ISIS is with their fundamentalism.

But who cares.. another thing.. every group hates every other group at some point.. some gays hate straights, some straights hate gays, some blacks hate whites, some whites hate blacks.. strangely though you rarely see a black person dating another black person, or an Hispanic dating another Hispanic, or an Asian with a black guy (but that's rare because Asians hate black people). but when you are white, and say your aren't usually attracted to blacks and asians, they are the first ones ALL OVER YOUR SHIT. ironic, no?!! some girls hate guys, some guys hate girls, blah blah blah .. everyone is prejudiced against something. whether its Starbucks, blacks, asians, whites, green hair, yellow pubes, orange carpets, IKEA, the government, the North Korean government.. and everyone is full of shit.. everyone lies, no one is honest.. you have to pay taxes for shit nobody tells you about, or to take care of people who cant take care of themselves.. being gay is really getting over inflated, and I am so tired of the likes of Anderson Cooper and Andy Cohen (who by the way is considered THE DEVIL to work for. I personally know two journalists who said they would rather eat shit out of a Mexican guy's asshole for 16 years topped with gum drops than work for that two faced bitch of a cunt) .. 

LIFE SUCKS no matter who you are, eventually your bones start to creak and then you get buried in a dirt hole, to rot for eternity while worms and other creatures eat at your skin, bones, eyes, teeth, hair etc.

I have known this guy for all of my life. We are both males where I am bisexual, and is straight, maybe.  He was possible my first friend when I started school as a child.  But when high school started, we completely lost contact (due to us going to different high schools).  Then came the end oh high school and I was semi free because I started to drive.  I reconnected with my old friends from before I moved away, and we started to see each other more(hang out).  It wasn't just him and me, there were other friends in the group for the record.  During this time, I realized that this feeling I had for him wasn't just friendship, it was love.  But here comes the kicker, he started to date a girl that was also in the group, my other friend.  They had that kind of special love for each other that you could just feel.  
Then the end of summer came, and we all had to leave for college/military reasons. During this time, I definitely knew I loved him because I could only think of him everyday, still do today.  Him and my other friend broke up due to the long distance relationship complications, so that leaves him open.  
My question for anyone who reads this is that, I really like him a lot, and have fallen hard for him.  He is my best friend and i would like for him to know how I feel about him.

I feel so conflicted about my current relationship w/ my bf (M24/M24).  We've been together for 5 years, 4 of which we spent together in college (we met freshman yr), and the other in long-distance (he just started law school in NYC; i'm in DC doing policy research at a think tank).  We try to see each other almost every weekend.  I love him so much!!!  We're each other's first serious long-term partner.  He's perfect in every way and we're compatible in every way (we've talked about getting married)...but

The distance is really starting to weigh on me.  I'm starting to get really lonely during the weekdays when we're not together and I just sit in my apt alone after work.  We skype every night, but it's not the same as having him around to go out with and do things together.  I've tried taking up hobbies / doing activities w/ other friends, but it's also just not the same. This is terrible for me to say, but I also really hate doing the 4 hr trip to visit him every other weekend.  I know that shouldn't be a deal breaker, but it's such a time/$$$ kill + me going out-of-town for two weekends/month means I haven't really had the chance to embrace the city fully and have a social life of my own.  I can't really make plans w/ friends ever cause I'm constantly away visiting him.  He's been experiencing similar frustrations too in the reverse. 

I've been honest and expressed these concerns to my bf before but he always dismisses them as 'temporary'.  Originally he suggested I look for work in NYC, but I really love my job and there aren't any comparable research opportunities in NYC related to my specialty.  So it looks like we're stuck in this situation until he graduates in 2.5 years.

I consider my bf my soul-mate, and until recently I thought we'd end up spending the rest of our lives together, but now I'm in such a weird place.  I still love him silly, but the distance is really hard. 

Part of me is horrified at breaking up.  I feel so lucky to have found 'the one' on my first try.  I read all these \\gaybros discussions about how awful gay dating/hookup/app culture is these days, especially in DC, and I don't want to spend the rest of my 20s (30s? 40s?...) trying to find a second 'one' when I've already made a slam dunk.  I also feel like he would become really emotionally insecure if we broke up (I tried suggesting we 'take a break' once and he told me I was 'ruining his life'...), and I really don't want to hurt him!   At the same time though I feel like maybe I'm too sheltered/naive/young having only ever been in this one relationship and I should be branching out.

I really don't want to screw up a good thing, but something just isn't right.  Feeling so conflicted... Any advice?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey bros--&lt;/p&gt;

Haven't been on a date or even had a decent conversation with another gay guy in over 9 months. Now, naturally, I'd like to date, but I realize that, given the local climate, that shit just ain't gonna happen anytime soon. It really sucks, but that's life, I guess. That's not what I'm here to ask about though.

Lately, to be blunt, I've been horny as fuck. Like, masturbating daily (sometimes 2 or 3 times) and still feeling quite unsatisfied. In the past, I've never been one for a hookup, but I think I need to play around a little. At the very least, I gotta ""scratch this itch"", so to speak, because it's driving me insane. I don't even ask for much by most people's standards, just some mutual oral with someone who is at least a tiny bit attractive. That's all it would take, I'd be satiated for the next little while.

Here's the problem, I can't have that. Grindr is useless in my city, because NO ONE replies to any messages ever. Conversations almost never go past ""whatcha up to?"", let alone to a point where 2 people would agree to meet up. The other apps and dating sites are even worse, because no one uses them anymore around here. There's no gay bars or other LGBT-oriented businesses around. Guys don't approach one another or flirt at the mall or in the streets because everyone's either too damn shy or doesn't give a shit. I don't have any friends I can turn to, because the only gay people I'm friendly with happen to live in another city. 

The only person who I've spoken to on Grindr for more than 5 minutes in the last 6 months was a well-spoken, but terribly unattractive older gentleman that I spoke to about 3 months ago, whose advances I politely declined at the time, for obvious reasons.

So I'm a happily married gay guy (married to a guy) and we're generally super happy. I occasionally chat on Grindr and Scruff (my husband is aware and fine with it - this is not an issue) to meet new people and hopefully make new friends. This has worked a couple of times but some guys are looking for just sex (obviously not interested) and the vast majority of other guys aren't in the same place I am either intellectually, professionally, and in terms of being out. I don't mind talking to the occasional closet guy who wants to make friends but I really want to meet people who are at the same place I am. 

Obviously apps like Grindr aren't ideal for meeting professional people but the city I'm in doesn't have much in terms of gay groups for non-college folks. So does anyone have any suggestions? I'm in Edmonton if that helps at all. 

Thanks!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey Gay Bros!&lt;br/&gt;

1. Is it necessary to book a table at an oyster bar or is it more of a walk-in walk-out affair?


2. How long would you normally spend at an oyster bar? Do you just chuck down the oysters in quick succession or have 1 every 10 minutes?!


3. We're only looking to have a small, light lunch (a large dinner is planned) so it is socially acceptable just to order half a dozen oysters each? (Considering half a dozen oysters is a wallet breaking £16 (...we're students))

I'm a 21 year old closeted virgin guy living a mid-sized city in Europe, a city with close to non-existant gay-scene. The only way I have to see and meet other gay people is through websites like Planetromeo and Manhunt, although there's always the same people there (like, just 4 pages of results with the search feature) and I haven't managed to connect with any, most of them are much older than me. I have a Symbian-based phone so I can't use grindr, tinder or whatever else is out there (don't even know if they're available in my country). There's also the local version of craig's list, but it does not look very safe.

However, there is another form of meeting or at least hooking up with guys, but it's a trickier one: cruising. There are two, and only two, places in my city whose public bathrooms are frequented by people looking for a hook up. Needless to say, these bathrooms are somewhat ""abandoned"" and disgustingly filthy most of the time and the people looking for ""action"" are in general shady-looking people. I've gone a few times and got stares but I didn't dare to do anything, I'm very afraid of STD's and it looks like the best place to get them are places like this. Two weeks ago I hooked up with someone there for the very first time: I did it because he was my same age or close to it, he was obviously inexperienced too and we just did blowjobs/handjobs. It was my second gay experience ever, the first one being 4 years ago. So you can see finding someone like him was really an accompishment, as it took close to 4 years of nothing.

So, my problem is that I'm increasingly horny (to the point of doing something stupid, I fear, I've already got an ad on that craig'slist-like website with people sending me emails) and if I truly wanted I could have a go with some guy in the bathrooms there or by craig'slist, but I'm afraid of getting something. I would always use protection if it got to actual sex, but most guys there just want blowjobs and stuff like that, so I don't really know what to do.

Any advice?

First of all, I don't know how specific I'm allowed to be here on this sub, but the sidebar said ""no censoring"", so I'm just gonna spill it out.

I'm a gay 19-year old and I am having some issues with getting my gay on. I realized that I was homosexual about 4 years ago and today -luckily - I'm kind of comfortable with being gay. The problem is, the thought ofhaving sex with another man really frightens me. 

In terms of gay sex, I'm more interested in being the ""bottom"" than the ""top"", and all my fantasies about being in a relationship with another guy include me being the one on the receiving part. When I think about sleeping with someone, having oral sex etc doesn't seem as nice in comparison. 

Unfortunately, I have some problems with bacteria - after going to the bathroom I usually wash my hands in scolding water for several minutes. Therefore the thought of having sex through the anus really freaks me out, it's loaded with e.coli and what not.
Furthermore, I'm very afraid that I will accidentally hurt myself or tear anything. I don't know if surgery is possible in that area, but I feel like I wouldn't be able to live with irreversible damage to my anus. 

So this, as you probably can imagine, pretty much takes all of the sexiness out of gay sex for me. I have never been involved with anyone yet, but I have no idea how I would be able to sleep with someone with all of my hang-ups? This might not seem like such a big deal, but I really would want to be in a functioning relationship with a guy some day, and I feel like this is severely hurting my chanses?
