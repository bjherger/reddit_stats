Always interested in anthropology so I'll pose this question: do you as a gay man partake in ""gay culture""? This could be pride parades, gay bars, or having exclusively hanging with other gay people. 

I, myself, am a gay and married 26 year old and do not partake in anything I would define as ""gay culture"". Two of my best friends are straight dudes who I met at my corporate gym, I've never been to a pride parade or even a gay bar. I just haven't ever found myself with the desire. 

I think for me personally, I don't want to be defined by the gender I sleep with. Therefore, I want to be my friends' bro and not their gay-bro. And I hope I've accomplished that.

But this is something that concerns me and that I need to discuss and vent. It concerns my fiancé / boyfriend and me (I'm a guy). We have been together for a little more than 3 years now. We met at university. Since he was open about his sexuality with his friends and everyone I met when we started dating, it didn't bother me that he hadn't come out of the closet to any of his relatives or close family. Worth noting is that my boyfriend moved here (to Sweden) from a Catholic country in Southern Europe, and that his family is religiously Catholic. We talked about this a little loosely in the first months of our relationship, and he said that he intended to come out to his family as soon as he had a fixed income and felt financially secure, in case they would reject him. Now he has a fixed employment and works alongside his studies, he also takes financial student aid. I've mentioned this a few times, but he points out that he is afraid of the consequences that a ""coming out"" would have on his family. He's afraid that they'll give up any contact with him, or that he'll be beaten up by his father and brother. Now, my boyfriend and me live together, and each time he calls or chats on skype with his family, I have to hide or keep me quiet, so that they don't know that I'm there. However, he has told me that they know that we live together, but they don't know about our relationship status. It is also worth noting that I payed his family a visit two years ago, during our vacations in the mediterranean, and then I had to play his ""buddy"". I like this guy VERY MUCH. Most of the time, we have a good time together, and all of our friends, colleagues and my family in Sweden know that we are a couple. What makes me think of this whole closet story is among other things when my friends talk about how they're going to celebrate Christmas or other holidays, whether to celebrate them with their own family or with their partner's family, even gay couples that I know bring up these subjects. This hurts me badly, because we don't have the same situation. I have also thought about how it will be when we're done with our studies. Will I be his ""little secret"" to his family forever? When he dies, will I be welcome at his funeral? We spend a very large part of our time together. So I feel that it is unfair to both me and his family that he keeps this a secret. At the same time I do not know whether I’m entitled to demand that he come out? On several occasions when I have raised this subject, he has been pissed off and closed himself. Yesterday we talked about this, I told him how depressed I get of it. I also said that I did not know if I wanted this situation in my life. I don't know what to do. While this situation makes me sad, I love him very much. What right do I have to require him to come out to his family? How much time should I give him? Should I make any kind of ultimatum? Do you think he could come out to his family smoothly, even though they are religiosly Catholic? If so, how? Feel free to tell me if you have any tips or similar stories.

""If you haven't told them, or Oma [my maternal grandmother], I'm respectfully asking you not to say anything to them. They simply don't need to know. And I just don't know how they would handle the news at their advanced ages, and in Oma's case, her declining health.""

What is y'all's take on this? Have you been in a similar situation? It's difficult to process: my immediate family are so wonderfully supportive, but their insistence that I remain closeted to my grandparents is really troubling. I'm not sure what to do, or how to process this.

Well, no, in fact, I don't know that unless someone frigging tells me. Ugh.

Now I'm really upset that I was left out because people just assumed I would know.

Of course, I was completely caught off guard, and naturally I didn't know what to say back, except 'yeah' and smile. I then proceeded to (pretend) glance over the shelves again, nervously freaking out inside, thinking of something to say, while he continued to browse next to me, though it seemed like he wasn't interested in what was on the shelf, and was possibly looking for an 'in' to start a conversation with me. This lasted for about a minute, and then he left. I seriously contemplated leaving to follow him, but didn't want to potentially weird him out and embarrass myself if I was wrong, which seems kind of silly now, and I'm really regretting it. It's not so much shyness, although that's part of it, as much as it is just me not knowing what the fuck to say, especially when I am caught off guard like that.

I was somewhat of an ugly ducking growing up, (may still be, I'm not sure) and as a result, am very ambivalent about these sort of things. The concept of a mutual attraction is hard for me to grasp since it's always been a one sided thing for me.

There's this guy who goes to my school and he's sort of exactly my type - his face, build, even his voice are all essentially tailored to my own personal interests. Normally he'd be one of those guys you just pass in the hallway every now and then and admire from afar. But the thing is, he's a freshman.

I've always thought two years of separation was where things start getting sort of weird when it comes to high school romances or whatever. I tried to justify my attraction to him by telling myself that these types of relationships do exist, but then I realized I was a gay junior secretly ogling some unwitting, most likely straight freshman. That felt sort of... Predatory. So I've started trying to ignore him when I see him, but sometimes I can't help but glance his way. 

This type of thing has never really been a problem for me before. I entered high school being only attracted to guys much older than myself, and only while being here have I discovered a taste for guys around my own age. Now I'm mixed up between the fact that I like this guy and the fact that he doesn't really fit my criteria for ""allowable attraction.""

I guess what I'm asking here is, is this weird? Am as I creepy/gross as I feel? And does anyone know how I can get him out of my mind? Thanks, any insight is appreciated.

Normally he&amp;#39;d be one of those guys you just pass in the hallway every now and then and admire from afar. But the thing is, he&amp;#39;s a freshman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve always thought two years of separation was where things start getting sort of weird when it comes to high school romances or whatever. I tried to justify my attraction to him by telling myself that these types of relationships do exist, but then I realized I was a gay junior secretly ogling some unwitting, most likely straight freshman. That felt sort of... Predatory. So I&amp;#39;ve started trying to ignore him when I see him, but sometimes I can&amp;#39;t help but glance his way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This type of thing has never really been a problem for me before. I entered high school being only attracted to guys much older than myself, and only while being here have I discovered a taste for guys around my own age. Now I&amp;#39;m mixed up between the fact that I like this guy and the fact that he doesn&amp;#39;t really fit my criteria for &amp;quot;allowable attraction.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess what I&amp;#39;m asking here is, is this weird? Am as I creepy/gross as I feel? And does anyone know how I can get him out of my mind? Thanks, any insight is appreciated. &lt;/p&gt;

Why do I keep assuming my boyfriend is cheating on me?

We've both been in long term relationships before. I have never been cheated on before, I have never cheated on anyone before. He has been cheated on before (in a short relationship) and a few weeks ago, to my horror, accused me of talking with guys online/cheating: we worked through that and I convinced him of the truth. 

Ever since I've been having these odd feelings that he's cheating on me… I don’t think physically cheating but emotionally? As in I think he's going on dates… I find myself essentially not trusting him and I hate it. When he's doing his own thing I now think about what he might be doing (?) and whenever he changes his plans I find myself trying to ""catch-him"".  The brain is a amazing organ as I have now been able to paste together a reasonably feasible timeline /story of him meeting up with another guy and dates.

I know I'm being slightly crazy so I have decided not to talk about the subject head on but I have been trying to get information on this other guy and my bf schedule so I can disprove my theory. Is this mad? 

The thing is I have a lot of feelings for this man and I have no idea where this insecurity came from. 

Any advice? My gut is all twisted in a knot and I really don’t know what to do.

I'm basically posting this to tell my life story. So here it goes.

When I was younger, maybe 8, guy that used to work in our house tried to molest me. He asked me to touch his dick and I had behind my bed until he went away. I didn't know that what he had asked me to do was wrong, but I just didn't want to do it. When he left, I sent my mother an email, told her what happened and quite literally asked her, ""Is there something we can do about this?"" Needless to say, he no longer works for us.

Fast forward to around age 10. I start going through puberty and I begin to realize that I like guys. Keep in mind this is while I am in elementary school. I already get bullied, people call me gay, faggot, retard. You know, the usual crap. Instead of going to my neighborhood middle school, I go to one across town where no one knows me. The next one year is pretty good until I mature enough to read the news. Then it hits me: 1) Half the country thinks I should be stoned to death for who I am. 2) Half the country thinks that I am a lesser person because of who I am and who I love. 3) What is the point in living if I can't love?

One day, I came home from school went to my bedroom, and locked the door. I remember this day vividly. I had a knife in one hand and the phone in the other. For some (very lucky) reason, there was a small corner of my brain telling me to call someone. So with the knife inches from piercing my skin I dialed the suicide hotline. But then it occurred to me that if I call they will know I am a minor and they will call the police and my parents. I have a problem with that because I really don't want them to know. So I sat there crying for three hours, trying to reason with myself. It was so hard emotionally, I didn't think I would get anywhere from there.

The worst part of all of this is the act. Going to school, seeing ""friends"" and having to say that everything is awesome. Having to talk about all of the hot girls and having to talk about how so and so is a faggot. I put ""friends"" in quotation marks, by the way, because they aren't really friends. How can they be friends if they don't know the real me? Also some of you might tell me to ""be the change that I want to see in the world"". It's not that easy. If I try to be the change and stick up for people, I will literally get the crap beat out of me. I will be in a worse situation than before. 

OK, so I have talked myself out of suicide, but I still sat on that edge so close to the pit that would have trapped me. I decided that I needed something to take the edge off of my life. I turned to videogames. On video games it is insanely easy to lie. You can be different than who you are in real life and I think that's why I liked it so much. But eventually I did make really great friends. In fact, they were the first people that I came out to, and they were fine with it.

I feel like that is a sad statement. The first person that I came out to was someone I had never met in person before. They were just people in a videogame. They were no one. And even worse, coming out to them just made my mood worse because once I picked my head up from the computer I realized that my situation out here is still hopeless. Ya, I tried watching the ""It Gets Better"" videos, but all they did was make me think that there is no way it'll get better until I move out of my parents house and that is still 2-3 years away. 

Let me get closer to a point. I feel totally alone. There is no one that I can talk to about who I am as a person and as a human people because I like both of the guy friends that I have. They are both smart, funny and cute. I don't want to tell them because, first of all, one is anti-gay (fml) and the other one I don't want to tell because I also like him as a friend and I don't want him to drift away. 

Also, I don't want to come out of my parents because I REALLY don't want to fulfill the stereotype that ""Molested as a kid = gay"". 

Just knowing that I can't love like anyone else can love is depressing me. Anyone straight person can walk up to anyone else and tell them that they like them because that is what society perceives as OK. But I can't because I am different. I have to know for a fact that someone is gay before I make a move because if I don't wait I will just embarrass myself. I can't love who I love and it's driving me insane.

Reddit, my life really sucks right now. I'm depressed to the point where I'm just listening to Sam Smith's ""Make It To Me"" on repeat. I really need help guys.

I tried trojan magnums only to find out they're vanity sized and the exact same diameter as the durex. I have a pretty tame sex life so usually this isn't an issue but it was the other night and I want to find a good brand but without spending $60+ dollars to do so.

I have active profiles on both OKCupid and Fetlife. Ideally... I want someone who's into both, but I don't have the slightest idea how to find that. 

Every relationship I've been in, the sex has been very tame. I hesitate to say vanilla, because there has been some light bondage play, and some sexual torture things... But I have a DEEPLY submissive side. A really hot sexual scene for me is where the guy I'm with sexually humiliates and degrades me, subjecting me to things that a less horny me would think is repulsive. I like being with guys that expect to have control, and expect to be recognized as basically a god. I can find that on fetlife. 

But I also want just normal sex sometimes. I want cuddling, conversations, love... Equity in relationship dynamics. This is easy to find on OKC, but most prospects balk at kink that goes beyond edging.

Are any of you, or have any of you ever been in a situation like this? Where maybe every other/every third/fourth/whateverth sex session is really really kinky... but outside of that it was a mostly ""normal"" romantic relationship? How do you find this?

I'm just starting to feel anxious. I feel like right now, I have to either log into fetlife and constantly remind myself not to fall for the guys I talk to/play with... or I have to log into OKC and constantly remind myself that love matters more than sex, and bad sex with a partner I care about will be better than amazing sex with a stranger, ect. 

Quite frankly, I want both. Or something resembling both, at least a bit....

**TL;DR: How do I find someone that wants to cuddle with me for hours, just chatting and being adorable, and then tie me up, blindfold me, gag me with his dirty boxers and fuck me relentlessly with his foot pressing down on my cheek?**

The guy Ive been with for about 4 months found some spots on his butt that looked abnormal. He started panicking and looked to the internet (always a bad choice) and began to deduce that it was HPV. After checking with a doctor they said it is indeed HPV.

Now I'm not looking for a lecture about not wearing condoms or being reckless. We both have had blood work done before dating and it said we were clear however there is no test for HPV in men so that just wasn't an option. He plans to see the doctor again to see what he needs to do and then a dermatologist to remove the warts

Here's my questions:

After the removal of the warts how long should we abstain from anal sex?

Is oral still an option?

Can I still receive as long as he wears protection?

What are the chances of warts coming back?

Is there anything I can do in the way of clearing or preventing the virus from further problems?

There are probably more questions I'm forgetting but I'm looking for any information from someone who has knoweldge on the virus or has had an experience before. Thanks again guys.

We got along very well from the start, clicked almost instantly, were able to talk about anything and just listen to each other. Over that Christmas break I went home and got on grindr to see if any old friends were on there, and one was and asked me to come over to one of his parties, I went and ended up getting date raped. I had deleted grindr by then and it was too late for the police to do anything. I had filed a report but they were never able to do anything about it. I was given anti-anxiety meds to deal with things but i never really stuck to them. Over the past year things have been a very slippery slope for me and just stress along with everything has kept me on the brink of losing it a lot. My boyfriend was always there for me but I was afraid to talk about a lot of stuff or just didnt want to. This continued for awhile, we talked but we didnt talk about a lot of stuff as well. We are both somewhat introverts. I struggled and continue to struggle with the post rape. I had started getting on grindr to make myself feel better, getting compliments from guys saying I was cute or just talking to them. I never wanted to hook up. I struggled downloading and uninstalling grindr for a long time. I ended up meeting up with an old friend at one point and stuff happened and I couldnt tell him no. My boyfriend found out and nearly broke things off but decided not to and give me another chance. I started therapy and taking my pills again but that didnt last long. This past couple weeks he had seen my phone, I had fallen back into the grindr addiction. I had recently been extremely struggling paying off a card that had been racking up since last year, going up and down constantly. I felt trapped with no way out. I had gotten on grindr and a guy said he would help out and all he wanted to do was suck me off and jack himself off. I told him that would be it because I didnt want any penetration or kissing. my boyfriend had seen me on grindr and that morning got on my phone and went through and saw the messages and found out. He then broke up with me and I have been devastated. I had been so lost in everything that I was not able to think or anything. Things finally hit me after the breakup and ive actually been able to think about everything that I have done...I dont know why I could just not tell people no. I should have been able to. My ex now and I never really fought, we got along very well. I just really want to change. I know people say cheaters are always a cheater but I do not want that. I lost something I feel I cannot lose right now. I know this is all my fault and It is eating me alive. I have gotten back on my medications and am starting therapy again and plan on sticking to it no matter what this time. I am taking measures to make it happen. I dont know if he thinks I can change or not, I just wish he could see the better side of me. We have decided to stay friends for now, I just wish there could be more. I am not sure that it will ever happen. I know I don't deserve any type of chance from him now. If any time it would be after I fix the problems with myself. We currently live together and are the same major so we have the same schedule for the next 2 years essentially.

Just needing some advice, stories, experience or whatever people have to offer. I know I did terrible things but I have been really messed up since the rape and never fixed these things. They got out of control. I dont need people harassing me. I just need some help from fellow bros.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all I had dated my boyfriend about a year and a half both 21, starting in august of last year. We got along very well from the start, clicked almost instantly, were able to talk about anything and just listen to each other. Over that Christmas break I went home and got on grindr to see if any old friends were on there, and one was and asked me to come over to one of his parties, I went and ended up getting date raped. I had deleted grindr by then and it was too late for the police to do anything. I had filed a report but they were never able to do anything about it. I was given anti-anxiety meds to deal with things but i never really stuck to them. Over the past year things have been a very slippery slope for me and just stress along with everything has kept me on the brink of losing it a lot. My boyfriend was always there for me but I was afraid to talk about a lot of stuff or just didnt want to. This continued for awhile, we talked but we didnt talk about a lot of stuff as well. We are both somewhat introverts. I struggled and continue to struggle with the post rape. I had started getting on grindr to make myself feel better, getting compliments from guys saying I was cute or just talking to them. I never wanted to hook up. I struggled downloading and uninstalling grindr for a long time. I ended up meeting up with an old friend at one point and stuff happened and I couldnt tell him no. My boyfriend found out and nearly broke things off but decided not to and give me another chance. I started therapy and taking my pills again but that didnt last long.

For the past couple days I have been really depressed about me being gay. I am 15 years old in high school and I find that my life cannot be normal. I can't have a wife, or kids that are biologically mine. If I do have a husband/boyfriend I will always get weird looks. People hate for something I cant control and don't want.

A straight couple that I am friends with just admitted to me they had sex and it bothers me how it is so much harder for me to find a boyfriend. Even if I did, people would be grossed out if I said I had sex. I've considered coming out because that might make things better but I am still not sure. I cannot come to terms at all with my future gay life and it sucks.

I know down the road it will be 50x harder for me to find a boyfriend and it scared me. I have lots of friends, but no real best friend that I could really come out to first.

I know I don't have it that bad and I'm just ranting, but I am really depressed because of this.

Maybe just to get some advice?, opinions?, explanations? Not sure, but here's my situation.

I had my first hook-up/gay sexual experience Friday night. And it all went great... I went out with 'Charlie' and his friends, got hammered, thoroughly enjoyed myself, and long story short, went home with him. While I wasn't exactly *expecting* to sleep with him when we went out (the whole thing was a bit spontaneous actually), I was completely into it and knew what I was getting into. We had safe, sober sex in the morning. Pretty decent sex. 

But I'm not sure how I feel about it all, and here's some background info. 'Charlie' and I see each other consistently throughout the year (through a school organization of sorts), and will be seeing each other tomorrow. We have mutual friends... the LGBTQ community on campus is pretty ""aware?"" of everyone else. Not to mention we were making out at an after-party sponsored buy our university's LGBTQ student organization. Plus, we both expressed interest in each other much earlier than Friday night, so again, it wasn't terribly unexpected. He's only slightly older, and more sexually experienced than I am.

Again, I don't know what I feel. I enjoyed it all, and would be down to do it again, but I don't know what he wants. I don't know what it was to him. And it's fine if he doesn't want to do it again, I just want to have things somewhat settled? Yes, I know to just ask and give it time. And yes, I know to be wary of becoming romantically attached to him. Last night though, I just felt so LONELY. It was terrible. I don't like *dealing* with it all... trying to understand it... and I'm frustrated at myself for being so caught up in it.

I guess I'm looking for other thoughts or advice or something. 

TL;DR I lost my virginity to a friend/acquaintance. Having a difficult time processing it all.
