Anyway, been seeing if I can do something less hookup-y (hard when you are in the closet) and ended up having dinner with a guy, then messing around another day, and then just watching a movie, but while he is cute and nice I don't really get why I don't feel much. I am also chatting with some other guys and it is I guess exciting to think about stuff with them, but I am pretty sure it will be the same once the novelty wears off.

I don't know if it is how I approach these situations, or is it that just takes lot's of experience before this stuff is fun? Am I asexual lol?

Hi I wondered if there is anything better than Craigslist Sex Ad (M4M) posting. 

I want to find someone to have public (sex outside in private while hiking) and can't find a way to say that on Grindr without being considered ""weird"", same on Scruff, jack'd, and can't seem to do it on adam4adam. I don't want to post a facepic to the public on these ads because I don't want this to become public knowledge and stolen.

How should I write the CL posting to avoid flakes and fakes? What should I post to get the most attention and best results chest and cock or just cock? 

How do you do this without seeming sketchy (drinks first). On craigslist most are down low so you can't skype first or even really get a face pic from some of these guys. How do you find the hot ones? 

Most men lie about their age and stats, should I do this? Last time I posted I had so many one word replies without pics. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi I wondered if there is anything better than Craigslist Sex Ad (M4M) posting. &lt;/p&gt;

Today or I guess yesterday I awoke to a message from a friend asking to meet up. This friend I haven't talked to in a GOOD while wanted to catch up and shoot the breeze. But then he throws a curve ball that slapped the black of of my face. He says oh yeah Nate I'm gay btw and here's my bf. 

Obviously I'm thinking oh he's just being an asshole because he knows I think he's kind of cute and I wouldn't be opposed to messing around with him. But sure enough the dude is gay and there is his bf all over his Facebook wall. 

So many thoughts literally came stampeding through my head but the number one thought was why didn't he come and tell me first? I'm the token black and gay guy in our friend group surely he would talk to me about this! I come to find out that he has told all of our straight friends and told them not to tell me.

I'm kind of bummed by this information thinking what would make him do that. I'm thinking it must have been that party I threw last summer and I got plastered and told him I thought he was hella fine and other inappropriate things which I'm kicking myself for. So then I calm down and say to myself oh ok I can see why. He just came out he's still thinking I have the hots for him and he doesn't want me to think we suddenly have a chance of hooking up. 

Totally understandable. And it turns out that was actually the reason.  So I go on to explain to him. For some gays guys getting to sleep with a straight dude is kind of a big deal. Think of it how when some straight dudes try to get with lesbians. After I straighten everything up and I now let him know that I am not interested in him anymore nor do I want to be reminded of my drunken endeavors. We reconnect in a way and call it a day and that's that. 

But I still feel weird. I feel kind of second class and I honestly think that if he didn't hit me up for whatever reason he wanted to yesterday, I would never have known until some big get together. I feel kind of jilted and a little betrayed by my fellow gay man haha, but then when I look back I can't help but say well of course that would happen dude. So has anyone ever dealt with this before and how did you deal with it? Thanks for reading my nonsense I just needed to vent 😗

TL:DR friend comes out as gay out of nowhere and tells straight friends instead of me because of a past comment I made. We talked it out but I still feel like a second class friend because I wasn't told first 😛

Also just want to clarify. I didn't and never had feeling of wanting a relationship with my friend. Did I want to bang him. Yes, not gonna lie there but anything more than that no. To me it would have been another gay guy trying to get it in with a straight dude.

I just don't see how anyone could put with me in a long term relationship. When I visualise a relationship, it is nice and seems to make sense in my mind.

I don't think it can work in reality though.

I don't know, I've kind of gone off topic. Below is some general info on avoidant personality disorder copied from Wikipedia. Would you see yourself in a relationship with that?

*People with avoidant personality disorder often consider themselves to be socially inept or personally unappealing and avoid social interaction for fear of being ridiculed, humiliated, rejected, or disliked.*

*People with avoidant personality disorder are preoccupied with their own shortcomings and form relationships with others only if they believe they will not be rejected. Loss and rejection are so painful that these individuals will choose to be lonely rather than risk trying to connect with others. They often view themselves with contempt, while showing an increased inability to identify traits within themselves which are generally considered as positive within their societies.*

* Hypersensitivity to rejection/criticism
* Self-imposed social isolation
* Extreme shyness or anxiety in social situations, though the person feels a strong desire for close relationships
* Avoids physical contact because it has been associated with an unpleasant or painful stimulus
* Feelings of inadequacy
* Severe low self-esteem
* Self-loathing
* Mistrust of others
* Emotional distancing related to intimacy
* Highly self-conscious
* Self-critical about their problems relating to others
* Problems in occupational functioning
* Lonely self-perception, although others may find the relationship with them meaningful
* Feeling inferior to others
* In some more extreme cases — agoraphobia
* Uses fantasy as a form of escapism and to interrupt painful thoughts

They often view themselves with contempt, while showing an increased inability to identify traits within themselves which are generally considered as positive within their societies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hypersensitivity to rejection/criticism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self-imposed social isolation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extreme shyness or anxiety in social situations, though the person feels a strong desire for close relationships&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoids physical contact because it has been associated with an unpleasant or painful stimulus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feelings of inadequacy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Severe low self-esteem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self-loathing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mistrust of others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emotional distancing related to intimacy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highly self-conscious&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self-critical about their problems relating to others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Problems in occupational functioning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lonely self-perception, although others may find the relationship with them meaningful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feeling inferior to others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In some more extreme cases — agoraphobia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uses fantasy as a form of escapism and to interrupt painful thoughts&lt;/li&gt;

First of all, it's not THAT kind off blowing.

So my boyfriend and I have been in a relationship for around 7 months now. The first couple months was I guess our honeymoon phase? We would hang out all the time and go out for dinner and drinks and it was honestly great.

So around 3 months ago all that slowed down. Granted I started a new semester at school but I was free everyday in the evenings and he knew that. He works and he would be done work by 4 as well. The last time went on a dinner date was 3 months ago. We would meet for a hurried lunch once a a week for an hour and almost stopped spending time outside of that together. We text and talk to each other on the phone on a regular basis still.

I would ask him to come hang out with me for dinner or to study and he would agree but blow me off at the last minute with excuses like I'm too tired, or I ate something bad and now I don't feel well. Yesterday I asked him to come to the movies with me and he cancelled an hour before saying that he had a sore throat.

He texts me now saying his friend invited him to a bar and he's going. I asked him if he wasn't sick anymore and he said he feels fine now. I've talked to him before about how I feel ignored and I am his last priority and he said it wouldn't happen anymore but I feel like it's happening again. 

Am I putting too much thought into this? Or do I have cause for legitimate concern? Sorry for the length of text/rant but any advice would be appreciated!

He has a few problems, but who the hell doesn't? So normally I stay away from getting involved with my friends because nothing good ever results from it, but I can feel so comfortable around this guy and I can't help letting my guard down around him. To the point where I felt comfortable coming out to him and our friends. 
The next weekend our group of friends went to this EDM show/festival of sorts and there he comes up to me, tells me that he's proud of me coming out and gives me a kiss. My heart stops for a second to comprehend what happened and by the time I could respond, he was gone. Unfortunately,that only gave time for my brain to spiral out of control and fantasize about what that kiss meant. After the show, I confront him and asked if that kiss meant that he wanted to take our relationship to the next level, but he told me no. That he was straight and only trying to be supportive. I guess sometimes a kiss is just a kiss. And I felt like a fool, I read too much into it and jeopardized our friendship. The next morning was the first time I really had to force a laugh and I think he could tell. Just like that I ruined something great we had.
Later that day my dad picks me up so that we can go to my Uncles and celebrate my grandmas birthday, but on the car ride home I lose it. I tried to keep it in but I was so overwhelmed with sadness and regret, I couldn't stop crying for the majority of the ride.
Fast forward some, and it took me a while, but I was able to put away the feelings I've had and things started to become normal, but I went to another show with him and he expressed some more emotions and it keeps tearing me apart. I don't want to reject his feelings, because he might be confused and his family isn't very supportive of gays. But it seems like that everytime I take a step forward, he takes two back. I'm not one who usually expresses any intimate emotions so this whole ordeal is literally ripping my heart in two. Bros, what do I do???

So here's my question to you guys: is it really gay if I've only ever felt this way about one person, ever? I'm not concerned with labels as I know how I feel, I would just like your input. Thanks i advance guys.

I'm sure this happens a lot to people but hasn't really happened to me before. My coworker is just ridiculously attractive and I can barely deal with it. I would like to interact with him normally. I haven't had to talk with him much. Let me give you the lowdown:

(1) He's straight and married. I'm not trying to get with him. At all. Not that I would refuse him if he suggested it. It's just that won't happen.

(2) He's like a 9 out of 10, *at the worst*. How am I supposed to look at him? How am I supposed to listen to him talk about the projects he's managing, and understand what he's saying, when I'm busy looking into his eyes, and just nodding my head saying ""uh-huh, yeah. Definitely.""

(3) We have only talked a couple of times. The first time we talked I was looking for cups by the water cooler. I asked a guy I saw walking past, ""hey, do you know where I can find a cup?"" and then this chiseled, beautiful man with the deepest blue eyes and perfect smile slowly turns at me, and starts telling me about cups and their placement within the office. I immediately noticed that ring on his hand. Man he had me just squirming, asking me questions about my job that I had just started, and all I could do was say ""well I have to get that cup now and go eat."" Just couldn't deal.

(4) We talked again a little over a week later. I was still very nervous but initiated the conversation. Trying to maybe be friends. It was a perfectly normal conversation other than the fact that I was stammering over my words, analyzing everything that I said, considering *am I standing normal*, *does this look weird*, *I really hope he doesn't see that I'm into him*.

For the record I don't want people at my work to know that I'm gay. Not that I care if they know that I'm gay - it's actually that I really just don't care if my coworkers know that I'm gay, because I'm not trying to form deep, meaningful friendships. And with this guy, I want everything to function normally at a surface level so we can work effectively together.

But every time I walk past him talking to someone, I think about how much eye contact I'm giving, if it's too much, should I look away, should I say hey, okay make sure you're standing up nice and tall, deep breaths, concentrate, focus, you can walk past him and he won't think anything...good! Good job! You made it past him.

Anyways. I only have to interact with him in a limited fashion, but I get the sense that we could eventually end up working somewhat closely together.

My question is: how the hell do I get over attraction to somebody and view them as just a normal person? Sometimes I feel that I've go it under control, then I see that pretty mug of his and ughasldgkaagtrasf. I don't want to pursue it. Don't want to confess to him - I want to be respectable and act respectfully. He's married. Not trying to get with that.

I haven't completely messed up.

I haven't masturbated to him. That would make things awkward for me. I haven't confessed my crush. I've got a crush. What am I, 16? No, I'm a grown 24-year-old man, thank you. I haven't gushed to other coworkers about how attractive he is. I haven't sought him out for attention - on the contrary, if anything, I'm avoiding him.

Tl;dr: how does one get over an inappropriate crush, without revealing feelings? How does one remain completely stoic when speaking with one of the very most attractive men you've met?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey everybody.&lt;/p&gt;

Things didn't go as originally planned but that is a good thing ha ha. Instead of doing finger painting I decided to kick it up a notch and do spray painting. I cut up some 8x4 plywood and made 4 3x3 plywood squares as canvases. I got his favorite colors and a few more other cans of spray paint. Additionally, I also bought painter's tape, paper, scizzors, pens, and an exacto knife to create stencils. My friend and I ended up spray painted a primer coat of white on each board the night before. My basement turned into an art studio with a makeshift ventilation system. Valentine's day comes around and he takes me to dinner after that we head back to my place. I actually somehow kept this hidden from him and it was a huge surprise! He didn't expect it at all and loved it! This ended up being a huge success. He put his music on and we both went to town. It turned out so well he wants to do this again when it's warm out and we'll spray paint outside! We ended up painting for 4 hours until 2 am. Thanks everyone for the previous advice!

I am a 31 year old guy, good job, stable, kind, good looking (so I am told) etc etc. I don't have trouble getting dates or getting laid. However, I keep having this issue that is super frustrating.

Out of all of the guys I have dated over the past year and a half, I only end up liking the guys who end up being unavailable. This is not to say that I am attracted to the unavailability, because I am not -- but here is the typical scenario:

Go on a few dates -- everything is going great, mutual attraction great sex. Cuddles, kissing, etc etc. Then I find out by date 4-5 that they are not sure they can be in a LTR right now because of various reasons (none of these were of the bullshit variety) -- for example, one said he was applying for school and did not know where he would end up(he ended up moving out of state 2000 miles away), another found out he was going to have to moved out of the country for work, one was recently out of a long LTR and wasn't ready for something serious, another one was applying to grad school (which may take him out of the area)/working/going to school/full side activities. These were all genuine nice guys.

This is just driving me nuts. The chemistry with all of these guys was off the scale and it was serious crush time for me. And I felt the same back from each of them, but in each case it was cut off either by me or them because of what I stated above.

I go on other dates and it just always happens that the guys where there is no interest or chemistry, they aren't going anywhere, they are available etc. 

Like, I said I am not going into this looking for unavailable people, in fact, in each case I have not found out until at least 4 dates in. 

I am sure this is all the blind luck or bad luck of dating.. but it is just exhausting.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So this is probably more of a vent post than anything - but let me know what you guys think.&lt;/p&gt;

I met this older guy (I'm 29, he's 49) about three years ago at my gym. He once approached me and started a small coversation with me, just smalltalk. After I left the gym that day he saw me waiting for the bus, stopped his car and asked me if I needed a ride. As he was driving in my direction I took the offer. On the ride home we started talking and we also came to the ponit where he asked me if I live alone and if I have a girlfriend. I was deep in the closet back then and said that I am in a relationship with a girl. He then told me that he also is in a relationship with a woman. He then told me that he's never been married or even moved together with a woman. From then on we always had small conversations when seeing each other at the gym. Also he regularly offered me to join him on his ride home as we found out we live close to each other. A couple of times he even waited for me in the lockerroom (bout 10 minutes or so), so I could ride home with him. 

About a year ago I didn't renew my membership at the gym. Some friends asked me to join them for workouts at their gym, so I started working out there. After a year I returned to my old gym because I didn't like the new gym that much. This was two weeks ago. 

A week ago I saw the older guy again.  He instantly came to me with a smiling face and asked me how I was doing. He also made compliments about my body and the progress in adding size I made last year. Later in the lockerroom he asked me if I still lived at the same place and if I want a ride back home. 

I always liked him and found him very attractive. I am feeling some vibes that he might show an interest. But I'm not sure if he's just very nice or if there's more. He's a very communicative guy and knows a lot of people in the gym. I also saw him talking to women from time to time and checking them out a bit. 

Weird things is also, he only works out on the weekend, early in the morning. I imagine being in a relationship, I'd rather spend the weekend with my partner. But he is there every saturday and sunday morning, never misses a workout. He's living on his own, so when is he seeing his girlfriend if not on the weekends? I also find it hard to believe that a guy like him never got married. He's good looking, has a very good job etc....

I think it is possible, that we both lied about our relationships three years ago, that he could have lied about having a girlfriend, since I signalised being straight and he didn't want to scare me away, offering me a ride and coming out as gay. It could also be, that he's in the closet himself.

What should I do next? I'd like to get to know him even better but I'm not sure about his orientation. 

I came out to my family a couple of weeks ago, but none of my friends know yet, so I'm a bit scared to tell him that I have interest in him...

ps: sorry for the grammar, english is not my first language but I hope you get the point.

This is my first time posting here so excuse me if this topic has been discussed to death. Something just happened to me and I felt the need to vent.

so in university I attend this leadership program. It's basically a weekly workshop kind of thing where we discuss our values and ethics and morals and strengths... etc. 

The program is made up of 5 cohorts, I believe, which all meet on different days and times. Last year I was in a cohort different than the one I am in this year due to schedule changes. So I barely know the people in this new cohort. 

Today we were asked to talk about diversity and we were also asked to participate in an activity where if what the leader read out applied to you then you would stand up from your seat.

Well, one of those statements was ""stand up if you're heterosexual"" and at first I did not get up, but then everyone but one girl stood up, so I got out of my seat due to the discomfort of being almost the only one sitting down. 

The statements are not meant to offend anyone, on the contrary... they are meant to unite all of us because what happens in those workshops stays there (except for what you learn in them) 

 so anyhow, I felt incredibly upset at myself because it felt like all I stand for is just make believe (if that makes sense to anyone) and in a way... i felt like everyone knew about my sexuality and in their mind they were judging me.

I came out to my parents last year and have friends who know I'm gay, I go to gay clubs, bars, etc. So it just makes no sense to me why I can't be comfortable enough to tell a group of almost strangers that I'm gay.

I'm pretty sure that a lot of guys have experienced similar situations, so my question isn't why.... I guess my questions or kinda sorta advice requests are... does it make me a bad person for ""denying"" my sexuality? 

How have you guys dealt with disclosing your sexuality to a group of people u might not know so well... or even to the general public?

He hasn't come to the store I work at for about 2 months, but he finally came last week while I was working. I said how much I missed him and how he has to come more often, and replied with generally the same thing, and shook my hand (he's in his car, and I'm in the drive thru window, per usual). I say to him ""You should come back often, because me and a girl that goes to his school were going to get sushi and I wanted you to come too!"" He replied ecstatically with, ""I don't really eat sushi that often but I'd love to come!"". I come back with, ""Well, If I had your number I would call or text you"", this is the moment when he tells me his phone number so I can save it into my phone and call him so he can save mine to his. At this point he gives me cash to pay for his order, I tell him to keep it and use my manager code to give his whole order to him for free. He was so overjoyed at my generosity that he squeezes out of his car in the middle of a busy drive-thru line in front of my store to give me the hardest hug I’ve ever received through the drive-thru window. You KNOW my heart was beating a mile a minute, this was the best moment of my life.

&gt;  I text him as soon as he leaves my store: “Brandon!! :D”
&gt; 
&gt; His reply: “Mr. Nick?! :D”
&gt; 
I’ve tried to initiate conversation over text message with him multiple times, but he either doesn't reply immediately, or at all. And the few times where he does reply he will answer with something vague- for example: 

&gt; Me: “When’re we getting sushi? :)”
&gt; 
&gt; Him: “Sushii!! :D”
&gt; 
&gt; Not exactly the answer I was hoping for… When I reiterate a few minutes later.
&gt; 
&gt; Me: “Yes! When and where have you been? You’re not busy are you?”
&gt; 
&gt; Him (an hour later): “How was your Valentines Day!!” (The grammar nazi in me cringes)
&gt; 
Fast forward to today, his birthday, I asked him what he's doing in hope that maybe we can finally do something together outside of my job. He hasn't replied to any of my three messages about sushi, his day, or what he's doing for his birthday.

After a little research, I find out through his tagged posts on some social media websites that this is normal behavior for him to ignore his phone for large amount of time. So I don't think he purposely ignoring me, although it doesn't explain his lack of continuity in text messages.

Thats the most recent update I can provide at the moment. Now I ask for the general consensus, **what do I do at this point?** I would flirt over text casually, but he’s a horrible texter. I’d go so far as to say the worst person Ive ever texted in reference towards continuing a conversation, let alone having a longer than 10 second one.

I said how much I missed him and how he has to come more often, and replied with generally the same thing, and shook my hand (he&amp;#39;s in his car, and I&amp;#39;m in the drive thru window, per usual). I say to him &amp;quot;You should come back often, because me and a girl that goes to his school were going to get sushi and I wanted you to come too!&amp;quot; He replied ecstatically with, &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t really eat sushi that often but I&amp;#39;d love to come!&amp;quot;. I come back with, &amp;quot;Well, If I had your number I would call or text you&amp;quot;, this is the moment when he tells me his phone number so I can save it into my phone and call him so he can save mine to his. At this point he gives me cash to pay for his order, I tell him to keep it and use my manager code to give his whole order to him for free. He was so overjoyed at my generosity that he squeezes out of his car in the middle of a busy drive-thru line in front of my store to give me the hardest hug I’ve ever received through the drive-thru window. You KNOW my heart was beating a mile a minute, this was the best moment of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I text him as soon as he leaves my store: “Brandon!! :D”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His reply: “Mr. Nick?! :D”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve tried to initiate conversation over text message with him multiple times, but he either doesn&amp;#39;t reply immediately, or at all. And the few times where he does reply he will answer with something vague- for example: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: “When’re we getting sushi? :)”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Him: “Sushii!! :D”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not exactly the answer I was hoping for… When I reiterate a few minutes later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: “Yes! When and where have you been? You’re not busy are you?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Him (an hour later): “How was your Valentines Day!!” (The grammar nazi in me cringes)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to today, his birthday, I asked him what he&amp;#39;s doing in hope that maybe we can finally do something together outside of my job. He hasn&amp;#39;t replied to any of my three messages about sushi, his day, or what he&amp;#39;s doing for his birthday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a little research, I find out through his tagged posts on some social media websites that this is normal behavior for him to ignore his phone for large amount of time. So I don&amp;#39;t think he purposely ignoring me, although it doesn&amp;#39;t explain his lack of continuity in text messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thats the most recent update I can provide at the moment. Now I ask for the general consensus, &lt;strong&gt;what do I do at this point?&lt;/strong&gt; I would flirt over text casually, but he’s a horrible texter. I’d go so far as to say the worst person Ive ever texted in reference towards continuing a conversation, let alone having a longer than 10 second one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EDIT: Feel absolutely free to ask me any questions, I need all the advice I can get. I&amp;#39;m head over heels for this guy, and I feel like on the cusp of something amazing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I'll try keep it sweet and short. I was in a crappy relationship for about two years. I ended it 2 weeks ago and haven't felt sad about it at all, I knew it was the right thing to do. I started seeing someone else pretty much immediately and it was going amazingly well, we went out for dinner, we went on a date or two, constantly talking, lots of mutual attraction and we spent a lot of time together over a short period. We had sex a couple of times as well and I really enjoyed it, I think he did too. 

Yesterday though, I feel he's been a bit off with me. We've gone from having massive whatsapp conversations to short messages, he doesn't seem too eager to see me and I just feel like something is a bit 'off'. It's stupid but I'm just sat here in bed and I feel like crying because I'm worried he's bored of me or something stupid or done something silly at some point to put him off me. I can't think of what but I just feel down, even though he makes me so happy. Is it normal to have these kinds of feelings?

I am a straight male asking for grooming advice. I have a pretty hairy ass, gooch, and balls. I want to tidy up for my girlfriend so she has a cleaner looking cock and balls for her mouth to play in. I'm also asking about gooch and anal hair. 

I tried Ballsbalm on that area. I tried it on my arm first with success. But I nearly roasted my asshole and gooch off (It did get the hair off my asshole though). But it didn't remove a lot of hair from my testicles. 

Just to let you guys know, I left it on for about 8-9 minutes. It says not to go longer than 10 minutes. 

So what do you guys (or other guys. including boyfriends) do to remove the hair in those regions. I shaved with a Gillete razor on my balls. It worked out pretty good at first, but the stubble came back with fury. I also nicked myself a couple times. So how do you gay guys manscape? 

I'm slowly working to get my 8-pack abs again. Now I also want to hairless body and clean and hairless genitals. I love my girlfriend and I want to give her the best version of me!  :)

Both times with condoms.

The thing is I was surprised to learn I didn't feel anything. It was ""psychologically"" pleasurable in a 'being submissive' kinda way but I didn't feel stimulation. Heck the second time the guy was kinda rough and didnt use lube/stretch my ass so it hurt for a bit. 

Is this normal? If I keep trying will I eventually feel stimulation, like could this have been just a fluke with position or the guy in question? The first guy was slightly above average, second kinda smaller than average.
