Long story: I am on the road with a band at the moment and hadn't seen my boyfriend for 3 whole months owing to rehearsals and touring. An hour before yesterday's show, my boyfriend shows up backstage to surprise me and boy, was I thrilled! I didn't at all expect to see him for another month!

Here's where the trouble began. That evening was one of my worst performances with the band in a long time because I had to keep adjusting my throat because of the load I had just swallowed. Drinking water before the gig wasn't enough and I didn't know what else to drink. Is there like something that'll clear semen from the throat?

It's just the community here is so supportive and offer great insights a lot of the time, and I figured quite a few gaybros have dealt with self-hatred before.

Long story short, I tried to self-harm again the other night after a heated argument with my sperm donor, and again I was the one who ended up apologizing to him just to keep the peace.

So earlier tonight I ended up burning all my pictures from childhood, to high school and college. Or more specifically, I burned my image out of all those pictures of me and my friends and family, and then threw them in the trash. I expected to feel something (sadness or regret maybe), but felt nothing about throwing away all those memories, even as I took a second to recall the fun and the friends/family in the photos. The only thing I felt 'sure' about as I watched my face burn and melt over and over was that I deserve it (I only burned my face/body in the pictures), that someone worthless like me doesn't deserve to even be remembered.

I guess the point of this post is: How did you guys who hated yourselves get over it? I was raised not to express any undesirable emotion so I've always turned any anger or hate or disgust or disappointment I've felt inwards, and over the years this has culminated in self-harming and attempted suicides and a very harsh view of myself. The rational part of me says it's not healthy, but the rest of me can't stop holding on to those negative statements.

To be clear, I don't really have a problem with the gay part of myself. My self-hatred isn't because I'm gay, it's because I feel/am worthless. RuPaul says I can't expect anyone to love me until I love myself, but how do I even get to that point? I've tried self-affirming phrases and thinking positive thoughts about myself but I might as well be telling the person in the mirror they're a rainbow unicorn, I just don't believe the words. When the self-statement to the person in the mirror is something like, ""You're a worthless piece of shit, you deserve to die"" my mind is actually more open to believing and agreeing with that.

How did you guys deal with self-hatred and self-directed anger??

Been feeling really stressed and lousy about my life. Wanted to share, and know if anyone had any thoughts:

I've had one part time minimum wage job since last August (boring work and bad hours); I've been looking at better jobs and internships since then, but nothing's come through. I just took a second part time minimum wage job which gives me even less time now to research and apply for better jobs. 

Ideally what I want is to not live at home, but I live in New York, so even if I get a better paying job that would take a while. 

I also want to get in better shape and, further down the line, lose weight. I do judo, but with my schedule I've had to miss that for a few months. I've been trying to compensate by lifting weights/working out at home, but with this second job that's also getting to be harder since I feel like I'm always busy, exhausted, or hungry.

And I also have a play I've been working on, but the further I get to a final draft, the more I worry it's just going to sit in a drawer for the rest of my life.

I think I'd be able to deal with all of that on its own (I mean, I'm just describing life here) but I also get super disheartened in my sexual, romantic, and homosocial life. Without financial independence, better fitness, more career success, etc. I just feel inadequate. Instead of being more driven towards my goals I feel stressed and ashamed for having not met them. It doesn't help that in my mind I keep contrasting myself with gay people my age who I know or am aware of who are better off than me. I don't like it, but I get jealous kind of easily. 

I figure I would be comfortable with sacrificing some happiness in the present to work towards the future. But right now I feel like I'm doing nothing but working towards the future because the present is worthless. And the near future doesn't seem to be worth much more. And half the time I'm just spinning my wheels.

I guess I don't have a real question here; I'm just wondering if anyone has any thoughts. I know the obvious answer--stop comparing yourself to other people, enjoy what you have, and work hard on your goals. My living situation isn't that bad--if anything, I'm lucky--and as far as I can tell it's common. But I still feel miserable about it. And I keep tying it to my understanding of myself and the choices I make as a gay person (full disclosure: for a while I've had anxieties about not belonging in or being accepted by the gay community, so I'm kind of kicking up those feelings).

Sorry for the long post **(tl;dr: I'm 22 and have two shitty jobs, still live at home, and would to exercise more; this makes me stressed and anxious about dating, sex and meeting other gay people, and I feel bad.)** I know, it makes no sense. Maybe because the most visible positive images of gay life celebrate relative privilege, youth, and beauty, so when my life looks so different I feel like I don't have access to gay life at all?

I've had the biggest crush/attraction/full-blown love for this guy I have only known very casually for over a year. I'm telling you, he is absolute perfection. Perfect hair, tall, cute as a button, nice as can be. His family (and mine) is religious, I mean SUPER religious and in church is where I see him twice at the most each week.

I've long realized that I'm Bisexual, I just really like this guy. Now usually I would go on telling you how he is definitely straight, and not into me, but it really isn't the case with him. I don't go up and speak to him like I would like to (and I'm working on changing that) we haven't had a legitimate conversation in months. But ever so now and then he'll smile at me really hard.But I figure that can really mean anything. The thing that gets me though is that if I'm talking to someone as he walks by, he'll touch me on the shoulder usually, and say hi, again with a smile. I have NEVER seen him do this with someone else.

More and more I've been seeing people saying that touching someone on the shoulder or somewhere in that area is a great way of getting someone interested. Thing is I've been into him for quite some time and would like to shoot past the small stuff and into something a bit more fun if fate allows it. But I don't want it to turn out that he's just super friendly and I have trouble from my family and everyone else.

So, askgaybros, do you think a guy who isn't interested in you (meaning he's straight) would touch you and be extra nice around you or does this mean I have a chance and should pursue him further? If so, what do you recommend given our current situation?

I really think it stems from my own issue of losing my identity in the relationship and relying too much on him to support me. I want to go back to being the man he first fell in love with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I come forth to you bearing questions of how do I become a better me? Less anxious and more motivated? Maybe a hobby, practice or anything that you have found to make you happy with you. Any and all advice welcome!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR What are some things I can do that would help me stop feeling so unaccomplished and worth a damn?&lt;/p&gt;

I know liking guys puts me in a smaller dating pool but the thing is, I wont be in the main campus, but rather on a secondary campus next to a (very) small town. Any tips?

I'm a 26 year old guy who is still in the coming out process. I live in the United States. I have thought about running for public office in the future, and realized that if I were to come out after starting that path it could be detrimental. I'd rather be honest from the get-go so I could focus on policy instead of scandals. However, I have another skeleton in the closet.

When I was around 13/14, I would sometimes babysit my neighbors' kids whenever they went out for the night. The older son was either 8 or 9, the younger one was like 6 or 7, and they shared a room. One time, they went to their room to change in their room after swimming (their house had a pool). They were taking a while and starting to shout, so I went to check on them. They were wrestling, naked. I told them to cut it out and put some clothes on. 

They were dressed and we were headed downstairs when the younger brother said (paraphrasing) ""If you get to see my underpants, we should get yo see yours"". For some reason, I stopped in my tracks. The idea of stripping in front of these neighborhood kids while they kept their clothes on was getting my adolescent brain totally horned.

I did things I'm not proud of. The kids saw me in my underwear. They saw me naked. They asked why my dick was bigger than theirs, and I vaguely hinted at puberty. They asked why I was ""stiff"" and I briefly explained what an erection was. They asked to touch it and I let them stroke it a few times. I started to feel weird so I pulled up my pants and we moved on to the other room to play a board game instead. **Understand that I never touched them, and they had clothes on the entire time. This all took place over the course of like, 5 to 10 minutes.**

My question is this:
&gt; Can I get into any legal trouble for this? 

I honestly believe this is just a case of experimentation for both parties involved. Everyone was a minor, and consenting, so there is no issue with statutory rape. Also everyone was consenting, and they were the ones initiating by asking questions.

For more context, I don't think they would talk about what happened that day on their own. They have probably forgotten or repressed it, or feel too awkward about it to bring it up. I'm just worried that since I would likely run democratic, and their parents are staunch republican supporters, that they could somehow use the story to hurt my chances.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry everyone, but this is a bit of an uncomfortable question to ask...

I'm looking for advice. After mutually breaking up with my ex five years ago, I'm still trying to look for the dates, which is a difficult task because I am deaf (so people easily stopped talking to me) and that I'm a old-fashioned guy (I don't attend gay bars or clubs) who likes sports and history.

I'm off and on the social apps like Grindr, A4A, so on and I'm trying hard to focus on myself by quitting those apps but again and again, I was back on those apps because I guess I hate being single (especially on V-Day where I see those couples). I know this semester will be my last semester in DC (on campus) before I go anywhere for an internship next fall.

So my questions are:

*Should I stop using the apps and try to focus on myself and my education?

*Will I find someone I like despite the impossible odds because of not attending the gay hang-out areas like gay bars or clubs? (I like Nellie's though)

If anyone does not understand above, forgive me because I tend to type it all out and post now than edit later :S","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello guys,&lt;/p&gt;

Speaking about me, I’m 27 and I’m pathetic. I’m pathetic when I think about people in dangerous countries and the kids, also here, that are attacked by their own parents.

Not saying that my parents would be super happy about knowing that they will probably never have grandkids, but I’m sure that they would be OK with my life choices as they always did.
My grandpa was working with gay activists in the 60s, my aunt was working for a HIV-testing center while in med school and my father is a local politician that introduced (a sort of) same-sex civil unions. Even if my home country is not exactly very gay-friendly, I grew up in a *gauche caviar* environment were LGBT people are well accepted. Actually some of the coolest kids at my private HS and college were the gay ones.

Despite this, I’m here questioning my sexuality and wondering what I really am. Thinking if I should start dating girls as I tried to do the last 10 yrs. All thinking that I know is BS, because I know that straight guys don’t usually want to cuddle and fuck other guys. They think “what nice boobs has that college girl”, not “what nice ass has that frat boy”. 
Last year I was going through a difficult moment due to an illness in my family and was feeling very lonely (I live very far from my family). So, I started talking with a cute smart guy I met at the university (I’m a grad student). However, eventually, I cowardly backed out, even if for the first time in my life I was feeling that my romantic interest for another person was mutual.
Yep, I'm a pathetic bitter coward...

So, what about you? What was the event or thing that made you fully accept your sexuality? What was the epiphanic moment when you decided to stop lying to yourself?

So I've been stalking this reddit for ages, if you had asked me two weeks ago whether I would be so happy, content and seeing somebody, I would have laughed, cried and possibly hurt myself!

But! One night when I was drunk I signed up to a dating website, I chatted to a few guys, no one special, but then some guy took my fancy. I spoke to him for two weeks with the mindset: thinking I was destined to be alone (usual gay self loathing), yet I found someone, him.

All of your posts, I searched them all ""how do i act on a first date"", ""How do I get confidence?"", ""does he like me?"", well they were successful! I'm so happy!

I'm 25 and I met my guy on a dating website, I thought I was useless and ugly. Now, I feel amazing! Everyone on here says when you feel ready to tell people you're gay, you'll feel it. Well I've told all of my friends now (within the space of a week and a half), even the rugby lot, and I cannot believe the support and overwhelming response that I've received. I honestly feel like crying.

I haven't told my family yet, even though I wanted to announce it at our Mother's day meal earlier, I was going to slam the bottle of wine down and announce that I was gay. I was so close to doing it as now I do not care, however I didn't feel it was the right place in front of my whole family, but my parents will know within two weeks as I have set myself a task that I feel comfortable with, although I will probably tell them tomorrow after work because, like I said, I really don't give a fig anymore. I used to say to friends that my parents would never know I was gay, I would wait until they were dead (so ashamed). I never thought that I would actually want to talk to them about my sexuality. Yet here we are, two weeks later... 

Thankyou so much! I lurked this reddit for so long, got so much advice, and now I'm so happy. I didn't realise how sad I was (because I classed myself as a happy and positive person) but now that all my friends know, and I've met someone I can't stop smiling!!! 

Sorry for the misspellings and punctuation, I am drunk, but I feel endeavoured to you all. You are a bunch of amazing people, and this is, I feel, the best gay community on the web!

(Using my real reddit name as I am now out and proud) 

Once again, thank you all!!!! So Happy, I'm beaming!! 

EDIT: apologies for the 'I'm so happy' mentions, but my outlook on life has changed so much. I'm a strong character and I only wish that people who aren't as strong can read these stories and realise that they are normal, what they are feeling is normal, everyone deserves to be happy.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;ve been stalking this reddit for ages, if you had asked me two weeks ago whether I would be so happy, content and seeing somebody, I would have laughed, cried and possibly hurt myself!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But! One night when I was drunk I signed up to a dating website, I chatted to a few guys, no one special, but then some guy took my fancy. I spoke to him for two weeks with the mindset: thinking I was destined to be alone (usual gay self loathing), yet I found someone, him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of your posts, I searched them all &amp;quot;how do i act on a first date&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;How do I get confidence?&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;does he like me?&amp;quot;, well they were successful! I&amp;#39;m so happy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m 25 and I met my guy on a dating website, I thought I was useless and ugly. Now, I feel amazing! Everyone on here says when you feel ready to tell people you&amp;#39;re gay, you&amp;#39;ll feel it. Well I&amp;#39;ve told all of my friends now (within the space of a week and a half), even the rugby lot, and I cannot believe the support and overwhelming response that I&amp;#39;ve received. I honestly feel like crying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t told my family yet, even though I wanted to announce it at our Mother&amp;#39;s day meal earlier, I was going to slam the bottle of wine down and announce that I was gay. I was so close to doing it as now I do not care, however I didn&amp;#39;t feel it was the right place in front of my whole family, but my parents will know within two weeks as I have set myself a task that I feel comfortable with, although I will probably tell them tomorrow after work because, like I said, I really don&amp;#39;t give a fig anymore. I used to say to friends that my parents would never know I was gay, I would wait until they were dead (so ashamed). I never thought that I would actually want to talk to them about my sexuality. Yet here we are, two weeks later... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankyou so much! I lurked this reddit for so long, got so much advice, and now I&amp;#39;m so happy. I didn&amp;#39;t realise how sad I was (because I classed myself as a happy and positive person) but now that all my friends know, and I&amp;#39;ve met someone I can&amp;#39;t stop smiling!!! &lt;/p&gt;

I can't believe how much this thread blew up while I was sleeping. Sorry I wasn't able to keep on top of all the comments, but your advice has already been helpful. I didn't get into penis transplants and sex toys with him last night (one thing at a time!), but when we got in bed, we had some nice pillow-talk about his situation.

He also agreed that he needs to get back into therapy to help deal with feeling inadequate as a man, and his supplemental insurance from work will cover it, so that's good news. Thanks again everyone! I'll keep you guys posted on his progress with an update soon.

Edit 2: see my [update](http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/30mwo1/update_help_penis_envy_is_poisoning_our/) from a couple of weeks after this post; my bf is doing much better.

**Tl;dr My awesome boyfriend lost his junk in an accident, is eating himself alive with penis envy, and I don't know how to help him.**

Throwaway for reasons that will become obvious shortly. Ok, my problem is pretty weird, I don't know if anyone will be able to help, but I just don't know what to do here. I apologize for the long post, but this situation takes some explaining. Anyway, first the background.

 I(25m) started dating my bf (23m) two years ago, after being friends for about a year. We went to college together. As soon as I met him, I was smitten. He's a gorgeous hunk of man, his body is carved out of wood, he's tall, with broad shoulders and slim hips. He's olive-skinned, with a mop of shiny black curls and a neat black beard, and the most beautiful green eyes and incredible smile I've ever seen. But he was always really reserved, and at first I suspected but wasn't sure that he was gay. He came out to me after we became closer friends, with the help of some strong drinks. By then, I had the feeling that he liked me as a friend, but wasn't interested in me romantically, so I just tried to be his buddy. It was weird though, because he never seemed to be interested in or pursuing other guys, and he even seemed a bit nervous about checking out cute guys, or even talking about hot celebs. He gave off a vibe of being kinda sexually repressed.

After about a year, we were basically each others' best friends,  we hung out all the time and did everything together. One night when we were hanging out and having some drinks, just the two of us, I could tell he was nervous, and something was weighing on his mind. So I asked him if he was alright,  or if something was bothering him. He turned green, started shaking; he was totally distraught. I came and sat next to him, and put my arm around him, and told him he could tell me anything. Then he spilled everything. He said he had been crushing really hard on me for months,  but that he had been afraid to do anything about it. He had never done anything sexual with anyone, because when he was 12, he had been in a bad car accident, and his genitals were crushed and couldn't be saved. They had to amputate everything: penis, scrotum, and testicles (since I'm sure someone will ask, ""how does he pee?"" they made him a new peehole just behind where his balls used to be. He had a normal puberty with testosterone injections, which he still takes to maintain muscle mass and bone density). By then he was sobbing, it was hard keeping such a huge secret from everyone but his parents all those years, and he had been afraid that he'd never be able to have a relationship.  He was convinced I couldn't ever return his feelings, since he ""wasn't a real man."" I was trying to be comforting, but I was totally shocked. When he said he liked me, it was like my jerk-off fantasy come true, but I didn't know how to handle the rest of what he said. But I thought about it for a second, took a good look at my friend, and realized that it didn't change my feelings about him. He was the same awesome, hot guy he was before, and I was attracted to him as a whole package ; his *lack* of a package just wasn't that important in the grand scheme of things (it also probably helps that I really prefer to top). So I told him how sorry I was that he had gone through something so horrible and life-changing, and that his feelings for me were definitely mutual. I said if he would be patient with me, and help me figure out how to work with what he has, I would be willing to try and see if we could make a relationship work. Then I gave him his first kiss. 

We just took things really slow at first, for a while we just kissed and cuddled together, fully clothed. We were both a little bit intimidated by the prospect of full nudity, but we gradually worked our way up to it, and my bf taught me how to give him pleasure.  He told me that, even though he did have wet dreams, he had never been able to cum, but that he was able to enjoy sensations of being aroused, being caressed felt very good, and the scarring where his equipment used to be was still sensitive. He said he also enjoyed playing with his ass, and liked using a dildo or fingering himself. I've found that other erogenous zones on his body seem extra sensitive to compensate for what he lost. He loves having his feet rubbed, his thighs caressed, nipple play, and when I stroke or lick his armpits (he keeps them shaved just for that).

Our sex life and our relationship have surprisingly been really great (we moved in together, got a cat, and I could see myself spending the rest of my life with him), until a few months ago. It started out with something awesome. I was fucking my boyfriend, he was riding me while I was rubbing his scars like he likes, and I must have hit some kind of magic button inside him. He tensed up, started riding me really fast and hard, made the most crazed-animal sound I've ever heard, and then had his very first orgasm. I thought he had pissed himself at first, it was this *huge* gush of clear, watery liquid from between his legs. He was so excited and happy ; he thought he would never be able to do that. The problem is that he hasn't been able to do it since. We've tried recreating that exact scenario many times, and he's tried to make it happen with mega solo sessions. Nothing works. It was frustrating for him before this, he's told me how being a teenaged boy who couldn't jerk off was a special kind of hell. But it was more bearable because he didn't know what he was missing. Now he's just desperate to get off again, and it's really exacerbated his feelings of inadequacy as a man. The frequency of our sex started decreasing, and he has started to seem kind of down and distant when we do it. Recently, I asked him if he's not as into me as he was before. He said that he realized that he kind of resents and envies me in spite of himself. He sees what I have, he sees me enjoy getting off while he's so frustrated, and he just eats himself alive with jealously, and feels totally emasculated compared to me. It makes him wonder how I could possibly find him sexy the way he is.

Granted, the look of his smooth crotch took some getting used to, but at this point, I'm used to it. I find my boyfriend very sexy, and I love his body because it's his, just as it is. Sometimes I miss playing with cock, but mostly I just wish he had one so that he wouldn't feel so devastated, not because I'm dissatisfied. And I don't see him as any less of a man just because he had an unlucky accident. He's very handsome and masculine. 

How can I help him see himself the way I do, as a manly catch? And how can I help him deal with his frustration and disappointment with not being able to get off again? Maybe there's some special technique or toy that could help him? What can I do to help him feel better about himself and his situation if he never figures out how to cum again? I don't know what to do, and I'm really afraid of losing a great relationship with the best guy ever if I can't figure it out.

The frequency of our sex started decreasing, and he has started to seem kind of down and distant when we do it. Recently, I asked him if he&amp;#39;s not as into me as he was before. He said that he realized that he kind of resents and envies me in spite of himself. He sees what I have, he sees me enjoy getting off while he&amp;#39;s so frustrated, and he just eats himself alive with jealously, and feels totally emasculated compared to me. It makes him wonder how I could possibly find him sexy the way he is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Granted, the look of his smooth crotch took some getting used to, but at this point, I&amp;#39;m used to it. I find my boyfriend very sexy, and I love his body because it&amp;#39;s his, just as it is. Sometimes I miss playing with cock, but mostly I just wish he had one so that he wouldn&amp;#39;t feel so devastated, not because I&amp;#39;m dissatisfied. And I don&amp;#39;t see him as any less of a man just because he had an unlucky accident. He&amp;#39;s very handsome and masculine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can I help him see himself the way I do, as a manly catch? And how can I help him deal with his frustration and disappointment with not being able to get off again? Maybe there&amp;#39;s some special technique or toy that could help him? What can I do to help him feel better about himself and his situation if he never figures out how to cum again? I don&amp;#39;t know what to do, and I&amp;#39;m really afraid of losing a great relationship with the best guy ever if I can&amp;#39;t figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;

Thanks for reading. 

So, lately I've been putting myself out there. As in, actually replying to grindr and OKCupid messages and agreeing to dates - for someone who came out of the closet to not do anything about it, it's a pretty big deal that I can go out with guys and enjoy it. 

Thing is, I don't know if I am doing it correctly, because it seems guys fall off the face of the Earth with me, unless it turns out I am just not date material =( 

First time, great guy, I thought we connected pretty well, had a first date - coffee and a movie. I texted him afterwards a couple of times, even managed to get a second date, but afterwards he just disappeared. 

Second time guy was nice, he even invited me to his apartment - we ended up watching a movie, but he said he felt too tired so I left. Never contacted me again. 

Same pattern several times: I'd go out with a guy once, maybe twice, but it seems I have to be the one to keep the contact - like it falls on my shoulders to set up the possible dates/activities/etc. 

I don't know, maybe I'm reading too much when I'm with them, and they are not interested? Or am I supposed to keep knocking the door every single time? I don't want to come off as clingy. 

Just wondering. Any good word of advice?

So he'd bring his brother over when we hung out at my place or went to the gym. Ive spoken to him quite a bit over the past few weeks. I've given him advice on relationships, dating, sex (generally), working out etc. He's a pretty cool guy, but again, he's 18 and still immature. 

A week ago he texts me (at 1 am) asking if he could come over. I ask him if it's that urgent, and he says he just needs to talk to me. I call him instead. He was stuttering a lot at first and then blurted out that he likes me. Before I could even reply, he cut the phone (im guessing he got nervous). 

Now I'm not going to say that I didn't see it coming. He's flirted a few times, sat a bit too close to me sometimes but I never thought much of it. Yeah he's attractive and all, but he's young and my friend's brother. I don't see it working out. 

He's been avoiding me before I even got the chance to reply. He won't come to the gym anymore. My friend even asked me if everything was alright with him. I didn't tell him what happened (maybe I should). 

How do I go about dealing with this? Do I just go his house? I've called him a few times, he won't pick up at all. Ive texted him too and I've gotten no reply. The last thing I want is for him to feel bad but I don't know how to approach the situation.

Like when you grab your phone and you do the usual routine: Facebook, whatsapp, grindr and Twitter.

I always check those 4 apps. It's just a habit. 

And this one night this guy pmd me and I felt like interest.  he didn't drive me crazy but was nice and really gentleman and so we hooked up, I went to his place and we hit it off

Yesterday I met him for the second time and I was like: waiting for something to go wrong any minute, because. It's obvious that wit guys you find on grindr  you don't hook up more than once and if it's twice then it's just because of an exception.

And so I arrived to his apartment with a knot in my chest, because I wanted to just loosen up and be comfortable around him and feel him and hug him and kiss him and LOVE him without the need the control each and every one od my movements or words. I just wanted to try and be myself and pray that I wouldn't fuck it up somehow.

And so I didn't. We laid on the couch, we put on House of Cards and we cuddled throughout the entire episode. I was being the cutest guy ever. I would kiss him gently and caress him, sliding my fingers up and down his legs and arms and belly And feel Him really close.

I even managed to loosen up and gave him love and still. for as lovely as it was I knew it wouldn't go further than that and I expected to just see the end of it all.in any minute.

later on yesterday back home I grabbed my phone while chilling on the couch and did the usual check up: whatsapp. Facebook grindr and Twitter. 

And there he was on grindr:

 ""hey you naughty Boy""

- what the fuck are you doing here?
-what are you doing here?
- well not much different as what you.are doing here
- I feel like shit right now about this
- me too
- it shouldn't have to be this fucked up 
- well So is life
- the human being is so miserable 
- I agree. we really hit.it off and I really like you
- me too. So why are we doing this ?


And then I said something like: well.you are free and have always been free and I won't lie to you by saying that I trust men because I don't.  I freak out with guys I like. Im scared to death that they're gonna hurt me.

And then he was like: gay guys are always in the look for something they don't even know what it is. 

Or something like that

And I just felt like shit the whole time. I was feeling guilty and at the same time blaming him for not trusting me. But st the same time I didn't trust him either. And we only saw twice. We hardly talked about deep stuff and didn't connect profoundly but I would love to see where this would take us to

at the end he was like: we should end this right here and now. let's leave it at that.

And I Don't know what I want. I Want him bexcuse I'm sick of being so alone. I'm tired of having to look for new people all the time because I just can't commit. I'm sick of myself and emotionally drained from having to deal with so many frustrations of this type.

what should I do? I think I want him real bad

I go to a decent-sized school on the East Coast and it seems like everyone in the gayborhood here has been with everyone else. And just last night a friend of mine slept with a guy I've had a crush on (which he knows about, which is why he told me about it today). This guy has also apparently been with a few other people I've hooked up with, too. I've never really been in this situation before, where I know that someone I've slept with/want to sleep with has hooked up with someone I know. Is this typical in most gay scenes? How do you get over that uncomfortable feeling and get past it? ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Reddit,&lt;/p&gt;
