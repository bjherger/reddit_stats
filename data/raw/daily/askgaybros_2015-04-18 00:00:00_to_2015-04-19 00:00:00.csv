Question is if I am over-thinking it to seek PEP or is it advisable as a precaution? I can get it for free Monday morning, so still within the 72 hours, or pay to get it in a hospital sooner (possibly €100 upwards).

But my reaction wasn't ""aw how cute"" I felt anger, followed by jealousy. This is really weird for me. I've been single for three years, and I guess I'm pretty bitter about it (shocking right? lol) I'm not gonna pretend like I'm perfect and there's nothing wrong with me, but 2 out of those 3 years, I was single by choice, but I've been actively looking for the past year, and haven't had any luck.

I'm being polite, I'm in college, I have a job, I drive etc, all those expectations for a 22 year old are met.

I'm pretty clean so it's not a body odor issue, groom etc. I'm pretty talkative and always try to have them talk to me about them, instead of making it about myself. You get the picture.

I'm not fat or obese, but neither am I skinny, I've been called a Cub type before, if that paints a clear picture.

Was wondering if you handsome lads could give me some ideas or advice on my one year anniversary with my man, or even what you have done with your S/O in the past. Any feed back will be greatly appreciated! 

I have already gotten him and myself a gift of a very nice suit and will be giving that to him a week before our special day to get fitted, along with a note telling him where to meet me. 

Here are some of my ideas! 

* Idea 1: Early dinner at a very nice downtown restaurant (It's on the top floor of a circular building and very slowly rotates) and after dinner go to a nice wine bar for some drinks, then back to his place where I will have a bottle of wine waiting.

* Idea 2: A later dinner at the same rotating restaurant, but being later in the evening (9:30 PM) it will be a fantastic sunset view from the top of the building, then back to his place for some wine.

* Idea 3: Early dinner at a different downtown restaurant and then off to a comedy club to see an act, then back to his place for wine/drinks.

Thats all I have been able to think of, I want to make it a very special night that he wont forget so any ideas are welcome!

Update 1: http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/31tnnq/update_to_my_coworkers_staring_problems/

The slurs and offensive comments have calmed down considerably since calling him out last time. I didn't say anything after that, but I did notice an improvement.

 Yesterday evening, I was leaving for work and while opening up my car door, I see him walking toward me. I freak out cause I think he's going to try and beat me up, so I'm mentally preparing myself. Then the strangest thing happened. He said "" im sorry man"" and walked the other way to his car. Today was completely normal. No snarky comments or homophobic remarks. Not even one. I wasn't the only one surprised at how nice he was, my coworkers noticed it too. So I guess the problem is fixing itself now (I hope..) 

I still have no idea wtf happened, but I'll take it.

SO my parents are religious and homophobic. Dad is a pastor, mom is a leader in church too. They know I'm gay but I am not allowed to act on these impulses. They also think that campy sitcom gay = all gays. They honestly think I'm transgendered or something. So my little sister has shown some interesting tendencies. I mean she is as girly girl as it gets but she is always commenting on other girls bodies on tv and the sort. she is only 9 so its impossible to say but still. She is alot like me personality wise when i was younger, and one day I(stupidly)joked about her comments and that if she is anything else like me my parents may be surprised again. So now they try to stop me from anything ""girly"" and are stricter on whAT I watch and do. They also are cracking down on her, like throwing away pamphlets for softball and berating gays when they appear on tv. Fresh Off The Boat featured a gay character and we watch that as a family. They were gonna try and hide gays existence from her, the reason she isn't allowed to watch Legend Of Korra with me anymore. She asked why the character was so weird and they said he thought he liked boys, but boys cant like boys and girls cannot like girls. That makes God angry. all with me in the room mind you. They are always talking about the ""gay agenda"" as well. The thing is I don't want to be homeless so I don't date at all or anything. Every now and then I'll flirt or window shop but other than that its too dangerous. I plan on hiding anything I do end up doing when I move out from them as well. To save whatever bonds I have and all. My question is : should I be open and out asap so I can help my sister if she ends up being gay as well? Is it my duty as an older brother? Chances are if I do date someone though all contact will be cut off from me, which would make it so I cannot see my sister anymore. I don't know its confusing. I don't even feel right being gay, I mean I know it sounds weird but I'm afraid of burning in hell for being the way I am and feel wrong trying to help anyone else like  me...I hate being guilty for feeling this way but I've always been taught that.

1. I've never done any sort of dating straight or gay so my first question is where or how should i go about first finding gay guys? Mostly cause i don't want to end up hitting on a straight guy or something. I'm thinking of trying Tinder, but for some reason using online dating at 19 just seems weird idk why lol.

2. How should i go about it so that my family doesn't know, just going on dates out of the house and meeting at his place for anything else. *wink wink*

He knows what I look like. I've sent many pictures of myself to him over the pass few days. 

What do I do and say in this situation? 

I don't care about what he looks like much. I am not going to just automatically reject him for not being some super model. :( I just want to know the face of the one person that I am really starting to like a bunch. It feels weird not knowing what his eyes look like.

I was wondering if any of you could give me some insight regarding hemorrhoids. 

A couple of months ago I was diagnosed with hemorrhoids. My doctor suggested I increase my fiber intake (I've been taking psyllium husk every morning now), exercise more (wip), and use some prep h before bed. She told me that it would go away if I did all these things, but I haven't noticed any real improvement. I've been doing this routine since mid January.

extra notes: 
I do sit a lot because of the nature of my work

I have lost a good amount of weight since trying to deal with this

so overall can someone help me figure out what I'm doing wrong? Or at least how to get rid of them? The hemorrhoids are internal.

So within the past few months, my boyfriend pointed out something I hadn't noticed. On the head of my penis, right where the slit or urethra is is this weird pink/white bump(s.) It isn't painful but it does look alarming. It almost looks like genital warts however I was tested recently and she said I was negative for HPV. But she DID say I had herpes simplex 1. She (this is a PA, not the actual doctor mind you) said what was happening was a flare up and gave me a medication to take for 10 days to relieve the flare up.

I took the medication for the full 10 days and no difference at all. In fact, it even looked somewhat bigger. So I have decided to reschedule an appointment with the actual doctor for better examinations and help. 
The bump like I said is not painful but there are some effects that are extremely frustrating: first of all, I feel like this bump is blocking my flow of semen because there is a marked difference. I have no idea how long I have had this bump, but in the recent past there were zero issues. Also, if the head of my penis rubs against sheets or anything it usually bleeds.

Does anyone have ANY idea what I am dealing with? Is it warts? Is it a lesion of some sort or really just a flare up? Like I am desperate enough to give a picture for reference.
