I'm a 27 year old guy who identifies as straight, but have had sex with men, it sounds stupid but let me clarify.  
I have never had any romantic feelings for a guy, I am not physically attracted to the male body, except for the penis, and the reason i have sex with men was first out of a combination of curiosity and desperation (think 40 year old virgin scenarios)
I have since my first time with a guy come to enjoy various elements the sex, i have mostly topped but really enjoy being bottom, which is why i have a toy collection bigger than the average person.  

On the other hand, i am attracted to every single aspect of the female body, and i am super interested in relationships with females, but i have only had very little experience with women (both dating and sex-wise).  
My lack of experience probably stems from my exterior, as i am an extremely obese guy, and for some reason girls more often have a problem with weight than guys, so i ""take what i can"" so to say to get some release/satisfaction.  
Not that i have sex with guys all the time, i haven't had penetrative sex in over a year (and over 3½ years when it comes to women) but when an opportunity arises i take it  

**TL;DR**  
That was a whole lotta info for practical nothing, the actual question is how common it is to be open to all sexual partners, but only be romantically interested in the female gender

I like to be fucked, and will talk to total tops on apps but I just feel like there's something off with them. A lot just seem to want to ""assert dominance"" onto me in their tone when they chat on apps or in person. When they fuck they seem to only focus on their own sensations and completely neglecting mine. Some are ok but I have encountered so many horrible total tops that I'm starting to get turned off by them.

I also talk to and play with versatile guys and they are such great fuckers as they know what bottoming feels like. So they tend to be more emphatic and some vers guys that I met would even ask me what would I prefer them to do. Zero attitude problems with vers guys in comparison to total tops. BUT, when being asked to flip fuck, I just don't have to desire to fuck them, even though I know how enjoyable bottoming is to them also, so I feel really bad.

And there's once when I literally begged a guy who said that he's a bottom to fuck me. Finally he begrudgingly agreed. He played with my anus, prostate and dick for so long and edged me for almost an hour and I had to beg him to let me cum. He only really just fucked me for like a minute and all the other time was just spent on kissing, body contact, light oral, and fingering. It was the best sex of my life and I wished I could just marry him at that moment. Of course, he wanted to cum too and wanted me to fuck him, but I didn't feel like it, so I tried my best in fingering and sucking him off. I felt bad because I know he's a pig bottom like me too and would really want to be fucked, but he told me that it's ok and he enjoyed it too.

I want to be fucked all the time but those who only want to fuck all the time can be so inconsiderate :( Should I train myself to be more versatile so that I could enjoy more?

We left that date with just a kiss and I was happy with him, he was charming and thought he was an all around good guy. We tried to text every other day, but it was hard because I work the night shift and his schedule is all over the place. 

Fast forward a few dates and we decide to go to another bar, I get tipsy and super horny. We end up heavily making out in his back seat, we ask each other if we are clean, affirming we both were. So I fucked him bareback and that ended a goodnight. We go on another date, which I thought was fine, got dinner, some ice cream and ended it with a kiss. I text him and he doesn't reply until a week later which I am fine with because I know how busy he is.

Just before the 4th of July I start getting an itch in my urethra and notify him, his exact response was ""eek keep me updated"". A week later I am found with chlamydia, I notify him and its been almost 24 hours and he still has not responded. I come to find out he has blocked me on the app. At this point I am angry and confused, I start analyzing the situation and start making assumptions. He has little to no reaction from my notification, did this asshole know about his STD? I just pictured me bashing out his face, breaking his cheek bones, leaving a couple of black eyes and a bloody nose. I am angry at myself for being so naive, angry at myself for ignoring the precautions I should have taken.

We kept in touch via Skype and text and then I dated someone for 2 months. We rekindled after that ended and he came to visit for a week. For that week I stayed at his hotel, went to work from there, and came back to him and we hung out. Ever since then we have been texting and face timing non-stop. 

Now I've had my share chasing guys and falling too fast for a guy so I'm cautious but is there something to say about not having to chase and him still keeping me intrigued? I thought it was scary chasing someone and never knowing if they would reciprocate, but now it seems I've found someone I don't have to chase. Only problem is that he lives in England. We are trying to make plans for him to come out and visit for about 2 weeks at the end if August. Should I see how that goes and then go from there? For those who might have been in my situation, have any advice?

","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey Bros, so quick backstory: chatted with this guy on Grindr back in September when he was on holiday from England with his family. We kept in touch via Skype and text and then I dated someone for 2 months. We rekindled after that ended and he came to visit for a week. For that week I stayed at his hotel, went to work from there, and came back to him and we hung out. Ever since then we have been texting and face timing non-stop. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#39;ve had my share chasing guys and falling too fast for a guy so I&amp;#39;m cautious but is there something to say about not having to chase and him still keeping me intrigued? I thought it was scary chasing someone and never knowing if they would reciprocate, but now it seems I&amp;#39;ve found someone I don&amp;#39;t have to chase. Only problem is that he lives in England. We are trying to make plans for him to come out and visit for about 2 weeks at the end if August. Should I see how that goes and then go from there? For those who might have been in my situation, have any advice?&lt;/p&gt;

Last year I met a guy in a class and we instantly clicked.we talked and found out that we grew up around the same area and knew some of the same people. We were both at a new college and I think we got along so great because we were both semi lonely.

Throughout the school year I was super busy working a part time job, going to school and spending my spare time creating. ( I design) a few times he asked me if I wanted to study with him but I declined usually because the only hours available for me to study were around midnight.( I might've not told him that because Idk I'm weird) at the end of the year he asked for my number and insisted we hang out. So we texted a few times when I invited him to parties but he was travelling and when he texted me I was studying. *Besides he did kind of get red in the face when I told I saw someone else from our class at a party I went to one time and I assured him it wasn't my party. Everything kind of faded away.

Until I decided to friend him on facebook and instead of accepting my request he sent me a message and we talked nicely and caught up and it was easy... Friendly and then he told me that we should hang out when he is back in town. Grab a beer and smoke. 

I knew he had a girlfriend so I never thought of him in anywhere near those lines but one of my good friends insists that it's possibly because he had feelings for me.

Idk guys . I could tell you a few of some other fails but I just don't think I can pick up when a guy is hitting on me. I'm a busy person that's very friendly because I'm from the Midwest.

Living like this had been working for me somewhat for a while, started to talk to someone about it but since there isn't really much I can do right now it was more of an outlet.

However, recently I sort of without thinking downloaded Grindr. I thought I would just browse and delete, but I ended up chatting. Then I ended up sending pictures, and suddenly within a few days I wasn't thinking and had gotten my first bj from someone near by who split right after and it was bad. I still kept chatting to people though, and even though I am completely in the closet, some people now knew how I looked like. I don't know if it was horniness, or being repressed for so long, or having people react positively to how I look but I did it again after chatting with someone for a while. He was nice, but I wasn't attracted to him and I don't know what I am doing anymore.

None of the stuff I did felt good, I don't even know if I like guys or like the idea of being in a relationship and I also saw people who know who I am on the app, and I am scared that if anyone finds out I don't know where I will live.

I am freaking out right now, I have been not thinking about it but can't pretend it didn't happen forever and just feeling really sick in my gut. I am also scared to delete the app, because what if I stop talking to people and they get mad or something and then my pictures are spread. I haven't been on for a few days though, just makes me feel ill. I normally think everything I do through like 10 times, but with this I have been such an idiot and I just hate everything about it.

&lt;p&gt;I am freaking out right now, I have been not thinking about it but can&amp;#39;t pretend it didn&amp;#39;t happen forever and just feeling really sick in my gut. I am also scared to delete the app, because what if I stop talking to people and they get mad or something and then my pictures are spread. I haven&amp;#39;t been on for a few days though, just makes me feel ill. I normally think everything I do through like 10 times, but with this I have been such an idiot and I just hate everything about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know what my question is except is this normal, wtf is wrong with me, how can I stop feeling like shit? &lt;/p&gt;

I don't want to believe it because I might be dreaming, so I keep averting my eyes.

Anyone of you has a story where a crush also likes you? How did you know? Who made the move?

Please tell me it is possible. :-/","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have this major crush on a tall buff handsome dude in the gym. He tried to make eye contact several times at the locker room hours ago.&lt;/p&gt;
