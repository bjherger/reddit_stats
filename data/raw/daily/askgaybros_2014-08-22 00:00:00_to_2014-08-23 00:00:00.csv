Get ready for a wall of text, good luck. 

I've been around the block. I've had my fair share of fucked up relationships filled with good times mixed with bipolar insanity. Recently, I've started going out with a dude that just came out. A true virgin in every sense of the word. In the few times we've hung out, we've hooked up (only oral) and he's never managed to get me off. Part of me thinks it's just because it takes me a while to get off and his oral skills isn't the best.

Further, he's really looking for a boyfriend. I don't think I'm relationship material, having just gotten off a devastating and traumatic one a couple of months ago. When I'm with him, he's very sweet and I really find his sense of naivete and innocence really hot. Last week, I was startled to have met his friends and be introduced as his boyfriend. I didn't want to be rude and call him out on it, so I just went along, but part of me was a little jarred. This weekend, we're supposed to hangout and I sort of want to just keep it nonsexual despite his promise of a ""sexual escapade where we won't be leaving the bed"".

So dudes, what should I do? Should I cut and run? Any help would be much appreciated","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey dudes, hope you can help me out with this conundrum. Get ready for a wall of text, good luck. &lt;/p&gt;

I have been seeing this guy for about two months now. He asked me out after we hooked up over a weekend and everything was great at the beginning. As summer went on, things slowed down - he just graduated from college, and I'm a year older working as an engineer. Anyway, he is starting pharmacy school and I think things have slowed down because he is nervous about school. 

I sat down and had a conversation, told him how I felt, yada yada yada, and he basically said he needs to feel out how school is before things can get more serious. We're both our first boyfriends (and for me my first real relationship), and it hurts not knowing how things will pan out - he's already been pretty busy getting prepped for school.

Any bros have any tips/advice for dating others who are in post-secondary school? Should I stick around? I totally understand giving him space for studying in shit, but it is REALLY that time consuming? He's under the impression he will have no social life - yet I got my MS in engineering and still had time for fun.

He has been working on getting into shape recently, but he's still quite heavy.  Although we have sex regularly, he is growing unhappy with our relationship being open, and he wants to go exclusive.  I do not.

I'm not sure what to do.  I really love him, but he doesn't do anything for me sexually, to the point where I have zero arousal without manual stimulation.  Sex is very unsatisfying for me, but I'm happy to have sex with him to keep him happy.

He wants to know if we should ""take a break,"" and he started talking about how I'm either in the relationship or I'm not.

On the one hand, it feels really slutty for me to throw away a good relationship so that I can fuck around on the side.  On the other hand, I get nothing out of sex with him and would rather jerk off to porn.

It's my first real relationship and was his as well.  Because it was my first,  I was extremely worried about it,  as the guy seemed like he had come from my dreams.  We both wanted a relationship,  liked sci fi movies,  liked working out,  liked shooting, shared practically identical political beliefs,  liked the same sports and games,  and more. Everything was fine for the first few months of the relationship,  but after winter break at my college,  which we spent separate,  things changed. He started pulling away from me and refusing to do things with me,  which wouldn't have been so bad but he would make plans only to cancel at the last minute or not make plans at all,  which lead to me texting him all the time asking if he wanted to do this or that. First semester we had lunch together every day,  now I would eat with him maybe once a week,  with no explanation. We would hold hands and have small amounts of PDA, now when i leaned in to kiss him goodbye he pulled away from me and said there were to many people around. I panicked and I think over compensated for his lack of interest or action,  and he broke up with me in April a week after my birthday,  saying it was moving too fast for him and he felt smothered. This is why he pulled away from me,  he was afraid we were to close and not going to have our own experiences in college,  which was true but he never talked to me about it,  only saying everything was fine when I asked which made me worry. 

Now,  I'm back at school and I'm few buildings away from him in my apartment complex. I was talking to a mutual friend of ours,  who i confided in a bit after the breakup. He tells me my Ex really wants to still be friends with me, and is ready to be friends as soon as I am. This upsets me because I still care about him a lot and think our relationship could have still worked.  The final occurrence now is that he has created a profile on a gay app, which i have as well,  and he has a very detailed list of the type of gus he wants,  and the list describes me perfectly.  So I have to emotionally deal with an ex who I still love,  who really wants to still be friends,  but wants to date a guy who's just like me but not me. 

Any advice on what I should do would be greatly appreciated. I don't know if I should stop dating other people and just be friends with him,  and hope it leads to a second chance,  or just abandon all hopes of being with him again and try to find someone new.

Basically met a guy on grindr (*sigh* I know.. *Grindr*) we meet up, go for a nice walk and drive and then have some fun. Goes well, we chat more on grindr. We then meet for coffee and hang for a few hours, we both state we aren't looking relationships because of things going on but he tells me he does like me otherwise we would't have met up again. We both agree on friends and fun, however it's not like we are fuck buddies cos we wouldn't text and say we're horny and invite one or the other over, ya know? Anyway, week later he tells me he's deleting grindr, something he does just to give himself a break. I don't. we aren't anything so it was never a case of 'I delete, you delete?'. I was gonna delete because I was bored but I did start talking to a few fellas who I still chat too so I haven't. Anyway we meet up for a 3rd time this time for fun because he was going to work in another country for 3 weeks and when he would get back I'd be on a family holiday. I text him and he doesn't reply.. to me I wasn't expecting a reply and it sucked not to get one. Cue major overthinking. Then around 20 past 5 yesterday (Thursday) he replied! Best feeling ever. Outta the blue, quite unexpected. He answers what I sorta asked him (I didn't ask direct questions just statements of how I hope he had a good time) and then when I was replying I asked for coffee next week, to which is said yes to. 

Now here's my thing: 

Last night before I went to bed I was curious, I had a feeling. I put in his age into the filter on Grindr..and there he was. Online. My heart and stomach sank. That beautiful torso. My problem? Why did my heart sink? I'm on grindr (I'M ON GRINDR STILL FOR CRYING OUT LOUD), I've been with guys when I've been with him (safe of course) but why did my heart sink and stomach fill with dread. Dare I ask..am I getting feelings? That's what scares me. We both said we were looking friends and fun but every time we meet up I think a fall a bit more. Last time we were together I was physically prepared for anal when he told me 'let's not do anything heavy and what we're both comfortable with' which made me like and respect him so much more. Also, I gave him such a good blow job he got all dizzy when he came, haha. 

Thing is too...there's a 10 year age gap between us and he said he felt it was a bit much for a serious relationship though he has told me a few times how mature I am compared to some of guys he's been with. So I'm not sure what he'd want: someone his preferred age range who isn't mature enough, or me who is under his preferred age range but is quite mature compared to others. Also, he's bi and semi-closteted. His housemates don't know but he has friends that do.

So... is there anyone who has been in similar situations, am I getting feelings? And do I say 'Hi' on Grindr if I have his number and we text/whatsapp? An semi annoying thing he does is shift the conversation to an end..last night he wrote 'Chat soon.' so I don't wanna be messaging him on grindr annoying him, lol. He's a real nice guy and I think we have chemistry, everything seems natural and our silences aren't awkward. I'm really comfortable with him but I don't wanna freak him out and I'd rather have penetrative sex with him before I freak him out haha.

Anyway we meet up for a 3rd time this time for fun because he was going to work in another country for 3 weeks and when he would get back I&amp;#39;d be on a family holiday. I text him and he doesn&amp;#39;t reply.. to me I wasn&amp;#39;t expecting a reply and it sucked not to get one. Cue major overthinking. Then around 20 past 5 yesterday (Thursday) he replied! Best feeling ever. Outta the blue, quite unexpected. He answers what I sorta asked him (I didn&amp;#39;t ask direct questions just statements of how I hope he had a good time) and then when I was replying I asked for coffee next week, to which is said yes to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now here&amp;#39;s my thing: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night before I went to bed I was curious, I had a feeling. I put in his age into the filter on Grindr..and there he was. Online. My heart and stomach sank. That beautiful torso. My problem? Why did my heart sink? I&amp;#39;m on grindr (I&amp;#39;M ON GRINDR STILL FOR CRYING OUT LOUD), I&amp;#39;ve been with guys when I&amp;#39;ve been with him (safe of course) but why did my heart sink and stomach fill with dread. Dare I ask..am I getting feelings? That&amp;#39;s what scares me. We both said we were looking friends and fun but every time we meet up I think a fall a bit more. Last time we were together I was physically prepared for anal when he told me &amp;#39;let&amp;#39;s not do anything heavy and what we&amp;#39;re both comfortable with&amp;#39; which made me like and respect him so much more. Also, I gave him such a good blow job he got all dizzy when he came, haha. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thing is too...there&amp;#39;s a 10 year age gap between us and he said he felt it was a bit much for a serious relationship though he has told me a few times how mature I am compared to some of guys he&amp;#39;s been with. So I&amp;#39;m not sure what he&amp;#39;d want: someone his preferred age range who isn&amp;#39;t mature enough, or me who is under his preferred age range but is quite mature compared to others. Also, he&amp;#39;s bi and semi-closteted. His housemates don&amp;#39;t know but he has friends that do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So... is there anyone who has been in similar situations, am I getting feelings? And do I say &amp;#39;Hi&amp;#39; on Grindr if I have his number and we text/whatsapp? An semi annoying thing he does is shift the conversation to an end..last night he wrote &amp;#39;Chat soon.&amp;#39; so I don&amp;#39;t wanna be messaging him on grindr annoying him, lol. He&amp;#39;s a real nice guy and I think we have chemistry, everything seems natural and our silences aren&amp;#39;t awkward. I&amp;#39;m really comfortable with him but I don&amp;#39;t wanna freak him out and I&amp;#39;d rather have penetrative sex with him before I freak him out haha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edited to add some more details. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit (2): Is this how dating works? I&amp;#39;ve never dated before (though I have been hurt a few times &lt;em&gt;blah blah blah&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

I know it's stuff none of you want to hear.  I am totally at my wits end and don't know what to do so I'm just trying anything.  I'm not looking for absolution, I just feel I want to confess, I guess. 

I get extreme I guess what you would call panic attacks around gay men followed by periods of extreme depression. 

To try to be consice about why: I have social anxiety disorder.  A lot of things put me over the edge.  However, I've become comfortable enough with straight men and straight women that I do pretty well with them socially (well, OK).  This is because everyone in my world is straight, as are most people in my day to day life.  

The other thing about me is that I consider myself to be radically political, which means I care A LOT and am very well informed about systems of oppression.  The problem is that all exists in me just in theory.  And the question is how to put that into practice. 

I've become so invested in learning and caring about systems of depression that I've built up a strong association between gay men (and other minorities) with extraordinary feelings of guilt and pain and sadness and shame.  It's nothing I have to think about to get to that place.  It's a pavlonian reaction.  Again, I don't have any other associations with gay men than that. 

Is some of my anxiety rooted in homophobia?  I'm not opposed to anythign about gay men at all.  But it is true that when I'm around gay men and they behave differently from the straight people I'm used to, I get uncomfortable.  Not always, but if I'm focused on that.  I don't know how to relate or react to them, and I feel EXTRAORDINARY pressure to relate and react to them correctly.  and inevitably fail and then just get hit with this tidal wave of guilt and depression.  That reaction isn't limited to me.  I've noticed this behavior in lots of radical people, esp. because we care more.  I've seen gay men act that way around black people, and black people act that way around gay men eg.  I'm not pointing this out to say that my discomfort is not homophobic or less homophobic, I'm saying that's the DEFINITION of oppression basically, feeling uncomfortable around someone because they're different from what you're used to is the core of it.  As well as is what you do with that discomfort. 

I don't feel this way 100% of the time, just when the pressure's on.  For instance, I may interact with several gay men in a day and feel no discomfort at all and will get along fine with them (as fine as you can get when it's just an interaction with a stranger basically), but when there's things at stake the anxiety starts.  If I really want a particular gay man's social acceptance for instance.  

When I feel this anxiety/discomfort/guilt/depression feeling it is TOTALITIZING.  It completely takes over me, and there is NOTHING I can do to stop it or manage it or deal with it, or rationalize it away.  I just sit there, radiating negative energy, heart pounding, chills everywhere, eyes wincing and tearing up and expressing complete and utter dread.  Gay men notice, as well they should and exactly what I was afraid of happens - they end up hating me, because it's abundantly clear I'm having a reaction towards THEM.  

This is going on at work right now, where I've worked for about a month.  Many gay men work there, and it's one of the few things I noticed.  After being terrified of losing it all, offending, being humiliated, I somehow was able to connect to some and was getting along great with all of them.  I didn't have any discomfort at all and enjoyed their company and personality.  One of them was really funny (not casting a funny gay stereotype, he actually was) and reminded me of gay teachers I had had as a kid.  I really thought he was cool and wanted his approval. 
Now, as I said when I start feeling this way it is completely knee jerk and I have no control over it.  I started to realize that a lot of men at my job who I thought were gay were actually straight, and that gay men might be the minority.  And this began to make me anxious thinking about how quickly I could get in this ""everyone's straight and they're different"" mindset, that I kind of walk around with from usually dealing just with straight people....I'll test the response to this post and then maybe continue on with it.

So I have a rather interesting Sunday coming up for me and I would like to hear the advice of some gaybros to help me out. 

Backstory: I have been struggling with my sexuality since around 12 years old. I finally told my parents in senior year of high school that I was addicted to gay porn. Sadly, at this time, I also believed that I could fix it by trying hard enough. We discussed where to go from there, and decided that I should stay in the closet and try acting straight in college. I should not be out or tell anyone I'm gay.

Fast forward to Junior year of college. I've decided that after two years of still not being sexually attracted to women that I'm gay. I came out to my roommates, friends, older brother, and some teammates. Then, I decided I should finally tell my parents. My parents are still of the belief that I haven't tried hard enough being straight and that there is a way to fix it: Fuck a girl. I don't want to. Its hard to have a desire to do that when your aren't physically attracted to the woman. 

So, gaybros, I ask you, what is some evidence or literature I can show them to convince them I'm gay? (I had my first kiss two nights ago and it was the most incredible thing ever, yes it was with a guy) Is there a site with a plethora of this sort of knowledge? Anything you can do to help is much appreciated! ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey gaybros, &lt;/p&gt;
