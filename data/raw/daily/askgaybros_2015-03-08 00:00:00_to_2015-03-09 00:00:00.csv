It's been a while, mostly because of exams in school.

We were at a party in my house together. Things were going well and he was teasing me as usual. Later I went into my room alone, and he followed. We started talking and we sat down on my bed together. We looked each other in the eyes and I kept looking towards his cock. He knew I wanted to suck it. He asked how to lock the door, I told him we can just move the dresser over and the handle can't move down. I asked if he wanted it locked, and he said no. That was it, he left. I thought this is it, this is going to happen.

Why did he leave? Why did he ask? Am I just making a big deal over nothing? Should I have made the move?

This is killing me, why did he bring me that close.

I've recently come out to my various friend groups as gay and a week ago I came out to my two best friends. They are a man and a woman and have been dating for a few years. 

My relationship with my best guy friend has always been sort of bromantic, and his girlfriend (my best girl friend) has always been alright with it. When I came out to them they were both extremely supportive and really happy for me. Fast forward a week. We are all drunk and things start to get steamy. **It turns out my guy friend has been talking to his girlfriend about wanting to be with me sexually, and she's into it. Really into it. Turns out they have an open relationship and want me to be their first ""other"".** I was hesitant at first but she was really persistent and I had had a huge on and off crush on this guy for a while (there's a whole history about that you're free to PM me about). We go back to my place and have a threesome. Needless to say it was mostly me and him and she played a pretty minor role. We all got off, talked for a bit and went to sleep. 

I just feel crappy, maybe a little used? Sex is pretty important to me and I have to feel really comfortable/attached to people before I have sex with them, hence why I was willing to have sex with my guy friend. But now his texts aren't as ""bromantic"" and she seemed sort of off before they left. I could be overthinking things, I often do, but I would be really upset if things changed for the worse.

I'm a sophomore in college. I'm largely in the closet, especially with regards to my family. I was very frustrated in high school and found college to be a relief. I rarely went home and pursued goals that were part of a larger theme of discovery and escape. 

I won a scholarship to go to the Middle East to study Arabic. This was a life changing experience for me. I changed my academic and professional goals, I changed personally...I overall became a better person with a more developed sense of purpose. 

After that experience, I felt bad about having shunned off my father so much. I started going home more, helping out more, and having changed my major to something he liked didn't hurt either.  Our relationship has improved dramatically, and I'm grateful for that.

But he still doesn't know I'm gay. His views on it were clear. He would unequivocally disown me if he knew I was gay, and it would be the end of our relationship. In fear of that, and because I'm somewhat financially dependent on him, I won't tell him until I'm done with school, but the whole thing makes me feel sick in a novel way. I feel like such a liar, such a disgrace. I feel like I'm putting on this big act and deceiving him so I can get a college education. It feels like distortion. And it makes this new relationship feel gilded. 

I was hoping you guys could give me some advice how to view this situation in a more palatable way.  I plan on telling him in a few years when I'm done with school, and giving him the choice whether or not to be in my life. I'm fine with that.

and felt that I needed to update you all on the situation. 

So, after realizing that we were probably not going to be together, ever- I stopped talking to him about his sexuality. But there was just one giant hellraiser-sized whirlwind shit spiral that happened and I need to get it off my chest with what has happened recently. 

So, after both getting completely jealous of each other, we just kept asking about each other's dates with other girls- this one girl he kept seeing for awhile cheated on her boyfriend with him, and he found out, so she wants nothing to do with him, and vice versa. The girl I saw just kept canceling dates and we don't talk either. So, both of us are now single, again. 

So, let's fast forward to last night. We were talking to each other and I just come clean, I tell him I've loved him since I saw him, and that I know he has feelings for me. I blink for not even a second, and next thing you know were hardcore passionately making out. It felt as if my brain flew out the back of my skull and I was completely immersed in true love for the first time of my entire life. From there, he tells me that he has feelings, but has no idea what to do with them; and unfortunately I have no fucking clue.

It can go three ways
1. We date
2. We stay friends and forget that ever happened
3. We never talk again

I honestly think if anything happens, it will be for the better. I have no fucking clue what the future holds. We texted after I got off of work this afternoon and I said that I need to talk to him about what happened. 

So, this is where I ask for your input on WHAT THE FUCK I AM SUPPOSED TO DO....

Why doesn't Grindr puts top / bottom / and vers filters in their apps. Doesn't it make it more ""sketchy"" that guys have to use up and down arrows instead of this built in. Its a sex app after all and sexual compatibility is important (even OKcupid has match questions about this). Can't they just use arrows to get around any IOS stipulations. That would be something worth paying for (filtering preference) instead of asking all the time or getting let down. Other apps somehow use top, bottom, and vers.

Why do they make you pay for push notifications, when all other gay apps include this for free? 

They need a ""woof"" or match feature like Jackd or Tinder. Too many guys are shy and say ""hi"" because they don't know wassup. 

Do you ever think they will fix their bot problems. It's gotten quite bad recently.

I've tried online dating in the past, but I find that there are never that many people signed up in my area (even after moving to the big city). I'm a bit of an odd duck, and oftentimes I find it difficult to find other guys I mix well with. 

When I do find a guy on a dating website or an app like Grindr who I like the looks of, 95% of the time they won't respond when I message them (and I know well-enough to message with more than ""Hey"" or ""What's up?""). I always try to include something about their profile as a conversation starter, I put a great deal of detail into my ""about me"", and I always have decent pictures up, but I still never get responses.

Whenever I meet a guy in day-to-day life whom I feel any kind of physical and personal attraction to, he's almost always I) straight or II) already in a relationship with an equally interesting, attractive person.

I don't really have that much time or disposable income to devote to things like clubs or activity groups, and rarely manage to get out in the evening. I usually work evenings, 3:00 to 11:30 pm or so. That's prevented me from attending some of less-expensive meet-ups that appeal to me, such as the monthly gay board games meet up. I'll occasionally go out to things like open mic nights (I'm an actor, so it's also a chance to network and show-off), but everyone there knows each other already, so it's often difficult to strike up conversation.

I'm begining to feel as though I'm doomed to loneliness by virtue of not looking like an Abercrombie and Fitch model (my fiancé running off with and marrying one of his gorgeous internet gaming friends didn't help), and while I'm not necessarily looking for my soulmate at this point in time, it's incredibly demoralizing feeling like I can't even get a casual coffee date with a guy I like.

Instant unfriend/unfollow/mute/block? Or wait and see? But wait for? I know most people would agree that the sensible thing for your sanity's sake, the earlier the better, is to just unfriend. But tapping the button is so, so hard.

I find it really ironic. I find it hard because I'm scared to let go. Like I would never find someone better than him. But it's exactly what I need otherwise I'll never move on.

My case is a bit different: I wanna unfriend him but he's still following me. I'm concerned that even though he'll never pop up in my feed again, he can still keep tabs on my life, etc but isn't blocking him too a bit drastic?

**Edit**: Thanks guys. It's like ripping of a band aid but I'll probably be better off after awhile.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s your take on this topic?
