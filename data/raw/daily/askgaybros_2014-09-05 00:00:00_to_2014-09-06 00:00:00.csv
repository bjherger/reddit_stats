Anyway, I suppose my problem recently has been my complete lack of gay friends. My only gay friend currently is a lesbian, which is nice, because we both understand each other, but also completely don't understand each other at the same time. 

I've been out for a little over two years and I live in California, so the gay population isn't exactly scarce, and I actually had quite a few gay friends a while back, but they suddenly stopped talking to me. My biggest guess for them not contacting me as much is due to the fact that I'm 20, and most of them are 23+ so I can understand not being invited to go to bars and clubs and what not, but they don't even text or message me on Facebook anymore. 

When I was friends with these guys, I had a really hard time relating to them on a social level. They mentioned movies, artists, music, tv shows, etc. that I never even heard about. Also, they were all pretty sexually open people, which I didn't mind, but I can be somewhat of a prude at times, and am still a virgin, which I could see a lot of them didn't approve of. I've also tried seeking out other gay friends through GSA clubs, Gay interest groups and what not, but came up with the same results, which were men who had completely different interests, or just didn't like me for whatever reason. (I also try to stay away from websites and apps like Grindr, just because I'm looking for friends and not a quick shag).

So I guess my question is, how did you guys find your gay friends, or even your boyfriends (current or past)? Usually, it's just been chance encounters for me, and the friendships never last very long due to a lack of common social interests. So any criticisms or general advice would be greatly appreciated!

So far my experience has been rather disappointing. I'm hoping its not an indication of the future.

I know apps probably aren't the best, but 90% of the guys I talk to within the first 5 minutes of a conversation ask if I'm a top or bottom. Even if their profile or the app is not specific to just a hoop-up.

Even when I meet people in public in eventually comes up way sooner than I'd want.

I say idk, never tried either. And they say ""oh great your vers"".

Is this not the same as straight people asking what sex position they prefer?

Or is it truly a more defining thing?

To me I wouldn't want someone at all that cared that much about that stuff. It feels like something that works itself out when your ready to have a sexual relationship.

If someone asks me, I usually lose all interest whatsoever in them.

When Im out in the world, when im on my own and living for myself I have this sinking feeling that Im going to go quietly into nothing.  Im starting to think that life is just a chase for a check, and that the engineering of our civil structures all relies on getting people to live for the stress of the cycle of accumulating money and owing debt.  Oh but thats only the half of it:  I dont feel as interesting as I used to feel.

About two years ago I moved to my hometown and set myself up.  I was taking some classes and getting some skills in art: sculpture, painting, photography.  That was some of the most fulfilled I ever felt but there was something unsettling about watching my body of work develop.  It proved to be very revealing in that who I am is a blank and formless person.  And I feel like Im waiting on something.  Im waiting for some cue or opportunity or - through hell even - dumb luck!  Every night before I go to sleep I personify it as a hand, white and luminous that stretches across a dark plain to where I am.  My life for a hand, reaching out with fingers outstretched to fold between mine.  I guess I thought I was waiting for someone but Im not so sure.

I dont know what it is about me.  Ive posted alot on here, on many accounts, and what have I learned?  Well for starters - that its hard to get across my sense of humor to my fellow gay men (for what its worth its hard to not be 'taken as a fool' on the internet to strangers when seeking advice or understanding).  Ive half-heartedly tried an attitude adjustment but its really hard to talk to myself, like I ought to know better.  I make bad choices on purpose because I dont have much else to do than to generate strife such that it may present opportunities to rise above it.  

Now Im just worried.  When it comes to romance, ive nothing.  What I feel anyways, because I do have a few devoted admirers, some persistent ex boyfriends, and some unfathomably unrealistic crushes.  But its devil in them all, for I feel nothing from them.  I used to think I just wasnt finding any reflection of myself in the eyes of others.  There was nothing of me imparted to the people I tried to share my life with.  No matter how cherished I held their spirit or nurtured their love I found it immeasurably difficult to discern any impact I had on their lives.  It was like I was doing nothing for them, and as such it did nothing for me.  I have a wicked habit of pulling away, phasing into the shadows, vanishing across time.  I dont feel a pull to stay to I find it more comfortable to slip away.  

I think back to one person I loved dearly as an example.  We had a whirlwind of a series of conversations and incredibly deep and detailed exploration of each others' feelings.  It proved to be fruitful for I felt at home, safe, and confident in my emotions for the first time in my life.  I had just come out to my family and I was starting to shift my whole mind-body perspective on being gay and becoming a person from ""this is an affliction I must abate and suffer for my whole life in utter indignity"" to ""this is a gift of love and supreme empathy and I am lucky to be such a sensitive person"".  

But he was too cool for me.  When I think about it I dont believe any of the more intimate emotions I divulged to him made him feel good about me.  I think he was put off my how deeply I felt about everything, how much consideration I gave to everything - moments and interactions and especially intimacy.  I think he liked my cock and my musclebody and how much I like playing with boys and giving all night massages, but he didnt find it very appealing that I thought of him so highly.  I guess from the most negative viewpoint, how I treated him was stalker-esque.  Now I sincerely would protest at the accusation of it (and assert my carebear qualities of ultimate sweetness!) but I think its how he felt.  In a sort of contextually-sensitive standpoint I think he preferred standoffish guy-you-hate-to-love and love-to-hate interactions (being bitchy and snarky and cold and wearing all black and never eating and smoking cigs and drinking tequila and staying out all night and doing cocaine).  

I guess I wasnt what he wanted and thats fine, but what burns me is that I was nothing nothing nothing to him after it became clear that I wasnt his type.  Yes that must be the word that works best in this situation, 'type'.  Now I feel like Im no ones type.  Gradually I sloughed through this past couple of years online and trawling the bar scene for good dancers and fast kissers.  So what bothers me now is much more compounded than the small indications that had been growing: I am losing sight of what it takes to be me.

I cant even jerk it anymore.  I used to passionately pound myself at least twice a day since the seventh grade in order to feel sane.  Now, out of instinct, I half-heartedly clutch my cock and I feel foolish and dumb.  I cant even enjoy fetish porn like I used to.  Sometimes I worry that Im never going to get tied up because I cant get excited about being me.  I feel too different.  I look around rooms and get the sensation that everyone else is tenfold times more comfortable with themselves than me even on their worst and most insecure days.  I cant go get coffee, or see a movie, or go bar hopping.  I dont belong and Im not welcome to sit in the corner and observe a la Warhol and voyeuristically ingest bits and pieces of real life as I see fit.  So I manufacture an entirely alternate and sterile environment for myself to live in: heroin, poetically classical music, wes anderson movies, and kraft mac n cheese or peanut butter slathered eggo waffles (sprayed with pam and toasted on both sides). 

Thats what I live for now.  I dont have any desire to go further because I dont understand or glean any significance from where I am at.   I havent made any progress on being a gay man and entering in the community of gay people.  I cant join the community of artists because Im too critical or demotivated by my own creations being that I am unable to 'get' who I am in order to bring the sense of life and inspirational wonderment I intended to my canvas.  I cant get a career because I cant convince myself to leave my 8-4 grind of a j-o-b that pays the bills and takes its toll physically.  I just cant imagine what it takes to put my heart and soul into things and have it come out right because most of the time I just dont see any impact or variance in the results or effects of my actions.  I feel weak and ineffective and worn out and smeared thinly across the roughly scribbled pages of my life.

Which is why I love heroin, its the best drug and I feel awesome and I can get out of my head and work on my art or bust my ass at my job and be showered with praise and gratitude because Im such a careful and considerate person.  I work in building maintenance so Im highly sought after because I make the spaces where people live beautiful.  I keep a sparkling pool.  Im the grease for the whole operation seeing that it goes on smoothly.  But I worry that Im not really being myself without understanding who I am or where I am at.

And where I am at right now is nothing.  Im going no where and its not that I like it, its just that its comfortable.  I dont have to risk anything or put my name on the line or try for better because I can get by.  Of course I want better but I havent reached that hand yet, the one thats stretched out to take me and lift me into the light of better and brighter things.  Im still just mucking around in the dirt and hopelessly pining away at the foolish belief that someones going to see through to my golden heart through the pitch black fog I exude.  

And I worry that the whole reason im doing this, the whole reason Im stuck and unloved and cant account for my heart or the pieces of it that Ive given to cherished others, is because I am uncomfortable with being gay.  I know my family makes it kind of awkward.  Im a big guy, tall and covered in muscle, with a dashing face and windswept hair in the darkest shade of blonde.  I think people expect hypermasculinity from me which I do well enough to act on (i like punching and wrestling and bad boy things), but that doesnt mean im not the most sensitive gayest boy around.  Plus my dad says that when I talk sometimes it sounds like steam escaping (i am horribly self-conscious about gayvoice).  And my mom is always trying to tell me how ok it is to be myself, but calling attention to it all the time just makes me feel like a freak and a pervert.  

And i cant understand being gay in general.  I dont really serve any need, so why bother trying to fulfill it?  I briefly thought my plummeting sex drive would be a welcome reprieve to the hypersexual tendencies I always had, daydreaming about turning every boy I see gay or being taken advantage of by a whole platoon of hunky army boys.  And levity aside, thats really the sentiment that comes across about me when it comes to being gay - i think its one of life's cruelest jokes and my whole existence is silly.  I cant get myself to have regular sex when Im dating because I feel foolish doing it.  Some small voice reminds me that the rule of nature is that Im supposed to be doing this with a woman and I have to remember how repulsed I am at the few times I had sex with females and how disturbed I was after having done it.  I felt wrong, or incomplete, like I might snap out of it and get a wife and have kids and end up with a purpose.  

I just cant see it and I dont think Im going to fall into any situation where I can any time soon and I feel cold and terribly frightened that what Im going to live for is going to become very personal and Im going to be stuck spending a lot of time with only myself.  That the closest I will come to actualizing my real self and letting myself come to grips with the emotions coursing through me is when im writing this depressing shit on the internet to be patronized by strangers or ridiculed by jerks. But sometimes I only feel at rest after Ive done this.  Thats why I have to write these things, because I have nothing to rely on and no one to tell.  

I have another ex who I hold special because he was audacious enough to steal a couple of the paintings that I actually bothered to finish (a very rare thing for me).  I felt honored and delighted that he had to have a piece of my heart and soul to look at every day, many times a day he has to see those things and think of me because it takes alot of work for me to finish a painting and they are very expressive and intriguing.  What I remember about him is when for a date one day we just went driving to all the state parks around our county, talking about our feelings and smoking weed and ending the day with a long walk down a narrow beach to land's end, laying down and staring into each others eyes and unable to hear each other over the howling ocean wind.  It was late winter and we had to bundle up next to each other and stare into each others face. And he just couldnt control the way he felt in that moment, I saw him totally swept up by his emotions over me.  I cuddled up to him and let hi grind on me and he was moaning for attention until i grabbed him with all my strength and kissed him and rubbed his neck and he came himself.  

I think I loved him but I just must not have been his type because he sabotaged our relationship with entirely imaginary accusations of infidelity.  Ive since spoken to alot of people I know with self-admitted jealousy issues and they tell me that it makes them think and do crazy things, but hes too far gone now and apart from sending him an occasional text to get a rise out of his enduring affection for me I just dont feel a part of his life anymore.  And whats more absurd is that these are the things I obsess over.  

I dont care about money, I dont care about finding a good career, I dont care about health insurance, I dont care about my longevity.  All I want is in my lifetime of romantic poetry, sensualization.  I want to feel and enjoy and live in comfort and I work my fucking ass off at having what I want but the problem is when I want nothing.  I avoid the gay world because of the struggle I have encountered trying to be a part of it.  Yet I pine to abandon my identity and sell myself into a foreign world to that I can become a sex object like how I feel so often.  I know that would dishonor my capability and talent but sometimes I just feel like I want to strap on some leathers and be someones sex puppy.  

So I conclude that being gay corrupts my thoughts, poisons my existence, and complicates my goals.  I have to wonder, are my feelings a gift or a curse?    ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have an incredibly difficult time investing in myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Im out in the world, when im on my own and living for myself I have this sinking feeling that Im going to go quietly into nothing.  Im starting to think that life is just a chase for a check, and that the engineering of our civil structures all relies on getting people to live for the stress of the cycle of accumulating money and owing debt.  Oh but thats only the half of it:  I dont feel as interesting as I used to feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About two years ago I moved to my hometown and set myself up.  I was taking some classes and getting some skills in art: sculpture, painting, photography.  That was some of the most fulfilled I ever felt but there was something unsettling about watching my body of work develop.  It proved to be very revealing in that who I am is a blank and formless person.  And I feel like Im waiting on something.  Im waiting for some cue or opportunity or - through hell even - dumb luck!  Every night before I go to sleep I personify it as a hand, white and luminous that stretches across a dark plain to where I am.  My life for a hand, reaching out with fingers outstretched to fold between mine.  I guess I thought I was waiting for someone but Im not so sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dont know what it is about me.  Ive posted alot on here, on many accounts, and what have I learned?  Well for starters - that its hard to get across my sense of humor to my fellow gay men (for what its worth its hard to not be &amp;#39;taken as a fool&amp;#39; on the internet to strangers when seeking advice or understanding).  Ive half-heartedly tried an attitude adjustment but its really hard to talk to myself, like I ought to know better.  I make bad choices on purpose because I dont have much else to do than to generate strife such that it may present opportunities to rise above it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now Im just worried.  When it comes to romance, ive nothing.  What I feel anyways, because I do have a few devoted admirers, some persistent ex boyfriends, and some unfathomably unrealistic crushes.  But its devil in them all, for I feel nothing from them.  I used to think I just wasnt finding any reflection of myself in the eyes of others.  There was nothing of me imparted to the people I tried to share my life with.  No matter how cherished I held their spirit or nurtured their love I found it immeasurably difficult to discern any impact I had on their lives.  It was like I was doing nothing for them, and as such it did nothing for me.  I have a wicked habit of pulling away, phasing into the shadows, vanishing across time.  I dont feel a pull to stay to I find it more comfortable to slip away.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think back to one person I loved dearly as an example.  We had a whirlwind of a series of conversations and incredibly deep and detailed exploration of each others&amp;#39; feelings.  It proved to be fruitful for I felt at home, safe, and confident in my emotions for the first time in my life.  I had just come out to my family and I was starting to shift my whole mind-body perspective on being gay and becoming a person from &amp;quot;this is an affliction I must abate and suffer for my whole life in utter indignity&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;this is a gift of love and supreme empathy and I am lucky to be such a sensitive person&amp;quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But he was too cool for me.  When I think about it I dont believe any of the more intimate emotions I divulged to him made him feel good about me.  I think he was put off my how deeply I felt about everything, how much consideration I gave to everything - moments and interactions and especially intimacy.  I think he liked my cock and my musclebody and how much I like playing with boys and giving all night massages, but he didnt find it very appealing that I thought of him so highly.  I guess from the most negative viewpoint, how I treated him was stalker-esque.  Now I sincerely would protest at the accusation of it (and assert my carebear qualities of ultimate sweetness!) but I think its how he felt.  In a sort of contextually-sensitive standpoint I think he preferred standoffish guy-you-hate-to-love and love-to-hate interactions (being bitchy and snarky and cold and wearing all black and never eating and smoking cigs and drinking tequila and staying out all night and doing cocaine).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess I wasnt what he wanted and thats fine, but what burns me is that I was nothing nothing nothing to him after it became clear that I wasnt his type.  Yes that must be the word that works best in this situation, &amp;#39;type&amp;#39;.  Now I feel like Im no ones type.  Gradually I sloughed through this past couple of years online and trawling the bar scene for good dancers and fast kissers.  So what bothers me now is much more compounded than the small indications that had been growing: I am losing sight of what it takes to be me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cant even jerk it anymore.  I used to passionately pound myself at least twice a day since the seventh grade in order to feel sane.  Now, out of instinct, I half-heartedly clutch my cock and I feel foolish and dumb.  I cant even enjoy fetish porn like I used to.  Sometimes I worry that Im never going to get tied up because I cant get excited about being me.  I feel too different.  I look around rooms and get the sensation that everyone else is tenfold times more comfortable with themselves than me even on their worst and most insecure days.  I cant go get coffee, or see a movie, or go bar hopping.  I dont belong and Im not welcome to sit in the corner and observe a la Warhol and voyeuristically ingest bits and pieces of real life as I see fit.  So I manufacture an entirely alternate and sterile environment for myself to live in: heroin, poetically classical music, wes anderson movies, and kraft mac n cheese or peanut butter slathered eggo waffles (sprayed with pam and toasted on both sides). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thats what I live for now.  I dont have any desire to go further because I dont understand or glean any significance from where I am at.   I havent made any progress on being a gay man and entering in the community of gay people.  I cant join the community of artists because Im too critical or demotivated by my own creations being that I am unable to &amp;#39;get&amp;#39; who I am in order to bring the sense of life and inspirational wonderment I intended to my canvas.  I cant get a career because I cant convince myself to leave my 8-4 grind of a j-o-b that pays the bills and takes its toll physically.  I just cant imagine what it takes to put my heart and soul into things and have it come out right because most of the time I just dont see any impact or variance in the results or effects of my actions.  I feel weak and ineffective and worn out and smeared thinly across the roughly scribbled pages of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is why I love heroin, its the best drug and I feel awesome and I can get out of my head and work on my art or bust my ass at my job and be showered with praise and gratitude because Im such a careful and considerate person.  I work in building maintenance so Im highly sought after because I make the spaces where people live beautiful.  I keep a sparkling pool.  Im the grease for the whole operation seeing that it goes on smoothly.  But I worry that Im not really being myself without understanding who I am or where I am at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And where I am at right now is nothing.  Im going no where and its not that I like it, its just that its comfortable.  I dont have to risk anything or put my name on the line or try for better because I can get by.

This isn't just one of those issues where I have problems talking to other guys and asking them out (which I do but that's not the big problem here.) It's just...I can't help but be spooked by the fact that it's the twenty-first century and you can still be killed for loving who you do. In America for God's sake.

I've tried to believe the ""it gets better"" rhetoric, really I do. But more and more I find myself asking what the point is of looking for a relationship when we have [similar domestic violence rates](http://www.advocate.com/crime/2014/09/04/2-studies-prove-domestic-violence-lgbt-issue) as heterosexual couples? Hell, we can't even keep from killing [each other](http://www.advocate.com/crime/2014/08/26/ex-boyfriend-sought-minn-bar-owners-murder) in addition to the fact that we're beaten and killed on the streets.

I want to fall in love. I want all the joys that brings. But I don't want it to get me killed. And I think the idea that it will is probably my greatest fear. I'm young, closing in on my 21st birthday. I don't want this ride to be over just yet. I don't want the wrong person to find out I'm gay and kill me. I don't want to have a significant other turn on me and shoot me in the back. I don't want to be a martyr. But I don't want to go through life with the fear of that.

I&amp;#39;m young, closing in on my 21st birthday. I don&amp;#39;t want this ride to be over just yet. I don&amp;#39;t want the wrong person to find out I&amp;#39;m gay and kill me. I don&amp;#39;t want to have a significant other turn on me and shoot me in the back. I don&amp;#39;t want to be a martyr. But I don&amp;#39;t want to go through life with the fear of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ask you, those of you who have been through more than I have, do you or did you have the same fears as I do? And is it really worth it? Does it really actually get better?&lt;/p&gt;

Or maybe I'm just paranoid. A lot of my friends are going out of town this weekend for kind of a gay getaway, two of which are Adam and Bob. I have been talking to Bob, who just got out of a relationship a recently, for a while now. We were friends before the relationship, and have definitely been getting closer after. Adam also just got out of a very short relationship a few weeks ago, and had been slutting it up ever since then. Not in a judge way, just sort of stating it. Well Adam and I are close friends also, I usually stay with him when we all go out on the weekends, and he definitely knows I am interested in Bob. 

Unfortunately, Adam and I got into a bit of an argument this past weekend in which he was getting at me for ""being a prude"" (denying one of his extremely drunk friend's multiple gropes and advances) and how I need to be friendlier to people more like him, and I reminded him that people buy me drinks all the time and I get a lot of offers, I'm just not that into drunken hookups. He kept pushing at it and I eventually snapped at him and told him that I have over a thousand unread messages on grindr (as if that is something to be proud of) if I'm looking for something like that and that I don't need alcohol to pull dick. I feel like a teenage girl just typing that shit out. It wasn't a huge argument, but we haven't talked since then either. 

So turns out that I have to work this weekend and can't go on the trip at the same time that Bob got work off and now can go on the trip. So since all the rooms are full, I found out today that now Adam is going as well and is splitting a hotel room with Bob. Fuck. 

As friendly as we are, I don't really trust Adam. Especially after how he has been acting this last few weeks and are little fight. I would not be worried about it so much, but Adam literally cannot say no to people he does  not like. And it comes from a place pure of heart, he just honestly doesn't not want to hurt anybody's feelings, which sometimes is a flaw as he gets stuck and I'm not sure how far that will go. Especially since there is going to be a lot of alcohol there and I do think that Adam is going to pull something just to prove a point.

I don't have any sort of ""claim"" on Bob. And I know I don't. I really do like him, but I feel like it is too soon to make some sort of mention of it, and if I do say something and Adam ends up being kosher, I will look jealous and paranoid.
