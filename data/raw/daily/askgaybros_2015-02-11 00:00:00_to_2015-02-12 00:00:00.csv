I love women. Up until tonight I had never touched another man inappropriately.

So for months now I've been slightly interested in cock. I've been really keen to suck a cock and be intimate with an older man. I'd occasionally take a break from straight porn and jack off to gay porn. As soon as I cummed I instantly felt turned off by it though. I'd also chat to guys on Grindr but never had any real intentions. Until tonight.

I logged onto Grindr, started speaking to some guys and traded photos. I started talking to this guy in his late 40's who was keen to play right away. He asked me to come over to his apartment. 

I get there after 30 minutes or so and am really nervous. He comes to the door and tells me his flatmate could be home any minute so we would have to go somewhere else in his building to play discreetly. I immediately get the jitters and tell him I want to bail. He says its fine and offers to drive me back to the city (just 10 minutes away) whilst offering to get a hotel. I continue to bail and tell him I'm really nervous. We drive into the city and he starts feeling my crotch which is fine so I pull down my boxers and let him play away. I decline a hotel again but suggest we pull over at a secluded park for some lite play. I was still kind of interested. I was incredibly nervous so I had a few pints of lager after dinner to calm down.

We get there, get outside the car and drop our trousers. We start wanking each other off but I find it kind of difficult to get turned on. It felt odd touching another man's cock and balls. I guess the reality of playing with an older man just didn't do it for me. He leans in for a kiss which I decline as I have no intention to kiss a guy. He also kissed my nipples which i felt very 'meh' about. We eventually cum, pull up our trousers and drive away. He drops me off and that is that. 

I actually wanted to suck his cock before hand (mutual oral also) however in the moment I had to intention to get on my knees. I just wasn't turned on enough. However, I now wish I had sucked his cock to see if that could have turned me on.

So, I'm positive I must be a lot more straight than I thought. I just needed to put this down in writing. Any thoughts would be great and I hope this is suitable for this sub.

**UPDATE:** So the next morning I messaged him saying I would have liked to suck his cock. He was at work only a few blocks away and suggested we meet in a toilet cubicle. I was quite nervous again but wanted to get it out of my system. I get there, we both drop our trousers and he begins wanking and sucking my cock. He pulls back for a bit and apologises - he doesn't like the taste of cum. I told him he could just wank me off instead and he does which makes me cum after a while. I then get down on my knees and put his bellend in my mouth and began sucking his cock. After maybe 20 seconds I stop as it just really wasn't doing anything for me. I started wanking him off and he cummed. We then left afterwords. I think I will definitely try hooking up with a guy my own age as the older guy fantasy is a let down in reality.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I see myself as a young (20) straight male.

We talked for a bit, and he seemed like a really cool guy so I agreed to meet up. We went for a walk around campus and then watched a couple episodes of Parks and Rec. Everything seemed normal, but I just wasn't feeling a connection with him so I knew there wouldn't be another date. Well the next day he texts me and I say it was fun, but we'd work out better as friends. He was a little bummed but appreciated the honesty and we went on our ways. 

We didn't talk for another month or so, and out of the blue he texts me saying he's miserable. He hates his life, doesn't want to live anymore, says his life is a mistake and he should just kill himself. I've helped a few people who have been like this before, so I called him, told him everything will be alright, calmed him down a bit, and then gave him the number for suicide hotline (1 (800) 273-8255 in case anyone needs it). This is where it got creepy:

He immediately clears up. Like mid sentence he just goes from hysterical to happy as can be. Starts asking me about my day, how I've been recently, if I've been talking to any guys. I respond hesitantly by saying something along the lines of ""I'm doing great, but I'm more worried about you. I want to make sure you're okay"". We talk for like 5 more minutes before I have to get going, and he's talking about how he wants to take me on another date. Like the last 5 minutes was him saying he wants to buy me lunch and take me on a cute date. Kind of a weird transition, so I said I'll talk about it later when I'm not in class. 

Afterwards, he shoots me a text that said this:
""Did I scare you Joe? :)"" (Joe's my name)

I had absolutely no clue how to respond... I said ""Yes. A lot. What is going on?"" and he responds ""Oh nothing. So about that date: Friday work?""

WTF. I don't know what was going on. Was he faking being suicidal so I would date him, or is there something legitimately wrong with him? And how the hell do I respond to this. I'm freaked out. On one hand, if he is suicidal I don't want to just ignore him and leave him alone. On the other, if he's faking I want to ignore him and leave him alone cause I'm freaked out...

So it's a bit of a weird story, but I'll keep it short: currently in Belgium and met a nice French garçon a few weeks ago. We hit it off and things are going well so far.

I say why not, without realizing this pesky little holiday known as SVD falls on a Saturday... And I honestly don't care much for it, but what if he does?

My problem is that I like this guy a lot, and I want to take it slow without rushing into things because, in my experience, that has rarely turned out well. So any advice on what we can do in the city that wouldn't be too overtly and exaggeratedly romantic? Or am I completely overthinking this?

He is kind, affectionate and thoughtful in every sense of the word yet I have begun to notice that when he is stressed (particularly with work) he has a tendency to shut down and shut me (and I would assume others) out as a result. 

During one of our early dates he  mentioned he had anxiety (most likely GAD; generalized anxiety disorder) and he had been seeing someone for it previously (and was given medication which he now only keeps for extreme circumstances) but has since stopped doing so due to some issue with his insurance. When asked if he would consider going back he mentioned he felt well enough to go forward on his own and we left it at that. 

However over the past few weeks things have become increasingly stressful at his job which has caused him to shut down to the point where I hardly hear from him at all. While I have no issue giving my significant other's their space I foresee this being a problem later on as our relationship becomes more serious since he doesn't seem to be able to compartmentalize his thoughts and leave work at work. 

I've spoken to him about this before and he agrees that he needs to find healthy coping mechanisms but aside from offering him reassurance that I'm here should he wish to talk (which I have done) I'm at a loss of what else I may be able to do. As someone working in the mental health field I do not want my professional role to seep into my relationship so I figured I would ask here in order to seek some guidance on what I can do while remaining firmly within my proper place in the relationship. 

Furthermore I would like some insight into how/why some people shut down and/or pull-away in the midst of a challenging period instead of going toward the people they care about. I'm looking for something outside of the typical 'lots of men shut down and pull away, it's normal' cliche. 

Men, even those who are prone to pulling away, are still human beings and I do not  believe any human being thrives when he/she emotionally isolates themselves. Those types of answers are lazy generalizations so if you choose to comment please try to provide something more substantive. If I wanted that I'd just go read Thought Catalog or any of the other numerous fluff blogs.

So I recently have been struggling with my sexuality. I 100% identify as bisexual but have not come out to any of my friends. Side note, I am attracted to and love having sex with guys but dont ever see myself long term with a guy. Anyways, I was consistently seeing the first guy I ever had sex with, but he recently ended things with me, as he was looking for something more serious and I couldnt reciprocate. I was devasted. Although our schedules didnt match well, I looked forward to seeing him every time I could. Just recently, I started hooking up with another person I was close to. It was purely sexual, but then today he admit that he was growing feelings. I was too, but still couldn't see myself being with him long term. He ended things with me this week too. Basically, I have lost my two and only gay romantic connections in my life. I feel devastated and somewhat lost--not in that I wan't to date either of these people but that I felt like they were the only two men I felt comfortable exploring my new sexuality with. Gaybros, what do I do? Do I search for others or end my curiosity? I don't see myself reconnecting with either of these past two guys as they don't think I am ready to come to terms with my sexuality. They feel as if I'm using them to explore a new side of myself, which is of course not at all the case as I began to develop feelings for both.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey gay bros-

I'm feeling shitty and would like some thoughts on how wrong am I and where to go from here.

So, back in november/2014 I started talking to this guy on hornet. He was sweet and interesting and also found me interesting, so we started talking a lot. Let's call him J.

Meeting up is been, so far, somewhat impossible because of his work hours. He lives in my hometown, and I've been home for summer vacations since mid December - I'm from Brazil.

Sometimes I felt like he wasn't that interested in me, otherwise he would have made and effort to meet up. Also, I felt like I was the only one always making conversation and stuff.

So last Thursday, I felt like giving up on J, since it was starting to die off and he seemed ever so blasé towards me.

 I went on a chatting room and met a different guy that goes to college here in my hometown. Call him W.

So, I didn't hit up J anymore. And gave W a bit more of a chance. He was definitely more interested, or at least didn't make so much excuses to meet up etc. J and I never discussed anything, definitely didn't have anything serious, so I had no right to confront him. Things didn't work out, I'll move on.

Monday, J calls me out of nowhere asking why haven't I talked to him in a while. I tell him he could've talked to me and that it was a busy weekend - actually was. He said he was looking for some company for a movie that night. I said sure - haven't met W in person until now, so... 

But J oversleeps and we have to cancel. He only warned me like, one hour before the actual date. I feel like I can't blame him since is his only day off, and he could be really tired, but a heads up would be nice.

I don't know if I should definitely give J up and focus just on W, or give up on W, be honest to him and give J one more shot, or give them both up and isolate myself or something.

Yeah, I know I'm wrong, but you can reassure me of that if you feel necessary .-.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok guys. I&amp;#39;m feeling shitty and would like some thoughts on how wrong am I and where to go from here.&lt;/p&gt;

I go out on a lot of first dates.  At least one or two a week, if not more.  Usually I meet these guys through Tinder, Hinge, OkCupid, etc.  

I swear, every time I am interested in going on more dates with someone, it completely fizzles out due to lack of interest on their part.  I don't understand what goes wrong.  I'm a pretty social person, and I tend to be aware of other people's vibes and if they're having a good time.  I don't understand how I can go on these really fun dates that end up going literally nowhere.  Twice in the past two and a half weeks now, I've gone out with a guy who I felt like I clicked really well with.  Both ended up lasting a very long time and felt natural and fun.

Then, in the next couple days, when I try to keep it going, I'm met with indifference.  For instance, on my most recent date, we texted all night for a couple of days and had a date planned.  Two days before the date, we were texting and he basically said how he couldn't wait.  We both realized we weren't doing anything that night, so decided to just meet that night for an hour or two instead.  The conversation went so well.  At one point, we were talking and looking into each other's eyes, and he just leaned in and kissed me out of nowhere.  He turned red and apologized, but I was really into him, so I kissed him back and he ended up staying the night at my place (no anal sex but everything else).  He stayed pretty late the next morning, we kissed goodbye and agreed to see each other again, but when I messaged him later, he was pretty quiet.  I don't think we're going to end up seeing each other again, although I would love to.  This type of scenario has happened several times now.

Something isn't adding up.  At first I got paranoid that maybe I looked uglier in real life than my pictures, but on dates, I usually get comments about how I'm cute/hot/attractive.  I also thought maybe I'm bad in bed or something, but then why do they always want to do things multiple times in a night, including usually in the morning?  And conversations always seem to go well.  I can tell when something isn't clicking, and these aren't the case.  They're two-sided, fun, and dynamic conversations.

Is it weird if I ask what went wrong?  I don't want to come off as needy or desperate.  There's been more than a few guys who I start to get excited about that just lose interest completely.  I don't know how they can go from excited about the next date one minute to hesitant to respond to messages a day or so later.

Any advice getting past this would be appreciated.  I'm starting to get really bummed out over this.  I can't keep letting myself open up and become interested in a guy only to end up disappointed and sad a couple of days letter.

Props if you read through this. 

So awhile ago, I posted about a guy I was talking to who had just disappeared on me (you can read that [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/2t9f02/guys_going_ghost_my_dating_life_is_apparently_a/) ) Eventually, I texted him asking him what was up, he responded saying he was sorry but he was busy at work, and he wished me a happy birthday, which I didn't prompt him on. After that, his texts became somewhat ""normal"" again. Okay.

Since then (this was a couple of weeks ago), we will still text. Not as frequent as when I first met him, but he at least responded the same day if I texted him. Now, we live an hour apart. He has no car, but I was always offering to go down to see him, or just casually asking if he wanted to hang out one weekend. There was always an excuse- dinner with a friend, or a busy weekend, etc. And yes, I am well aware that he is allowed to have a social life, so that's not really the issue.  I texted him today and basically just straight up asked if he ever wanted to hang out again. He said yes, but probably not more than friends because he's been seeing someone and he's pretty sure they're going to get serious. I told him I was happy for him, but asked why he didn't tell me, and he says that he's bad at hurting/upsetting/letting down people. Basically, after that, I told him I was upset he wasn't upfront with me before, and he just says that it was casual until recently. We go back and forth a bit, and I ask if he understood where I was coming from. He tells me that we weren't exclusive, and when he knew it wasn't going to go anywhere with us, that he let me know. The thing is, I don't recall him *ever* actually saying this to me, and when I asked him when that happened, all he said was, ""It doesn't matter."" I didn't want to end it on a bad note, so I let him know that I was happy for him and I hope that works out for him. 

So, yeah, of course I'm upset. I'm upset because I'm new to the same sex dating scene- and I mean, actual dating, and not just hooking up. This is big for me because I still consider myself to be bi, to an extent. My first time at a gay bar was with this guy, heck, my first time showing affection to a guy in public was with this guy. And granted, I know in myself that I am a very emotional person, in that when I care for someone it's completely, but I thought we had a connection. I made it pretty clear to him *many* times that I was into him. Guess I was stupid for trying if he was talking to this other guy ""on and off again for a year""...

At the same time, I'm also calling this another failed attempt at finding someone to date. Ever since I made the conscious decision to focus on serious dating, I try to tell myself that I'm not *that* crazy or I'm not *that* unattractive, but situations like these make it harder to keep telling myself that, especially going into Valentine's Day...

I don't know if I asked any question at all, but any words of encouragement and advice are appreciated. Thanks. 

**tl;dr- Guy I was interested in goes ghost, finally texts me again, but reveals he's about to get serious with someone else.**","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys, so I&amp;#39;m not sure what I&amp;#39;m asking, if I&amp;#39;m even asking anything at all, but I&amp;#39;m kinda bummed out right now and just needed a place to vent. Props if you read through this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So awhile ago, I posted about a guy I was talking to who had just disappeared on me (you can read that &lt;a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/2t9f02/guys_going_ghost_my_dating_life_is_apparently_a/""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; ) Eventually, I texted him asking him what was up, he responded saying he was sorry but he was busy at work, and he wished me a happy birthday, which I didn&amp;#39;t prompt him on. After that, his texts became somewhat &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; again. Okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then (this was a couple of weeks ago), we will still text. Not as frequent as when I first met him, but he at least responded the same day if I texted him. Now, we live an hour apart. He has no car, but I was always offering to go down to see him, or just casually asking if he wanted to hang out one weekend. There was always an excuse- dinner with a friend, or a busy weekend, etc. And yes, I am well aware that he is allowed to have a social life, so that&amp;#39;s not really the issue.  I texted him today and basically just straight up asked if he ever wanted to hang out again. He said yes, but probably not more than friends because he&amp;#39;s been seeing someone and he&amp;#39;s pretty sure they&amp;#39;re going to get serious. I told him I was happy for him, but asked why he didn&amp;#39;t tell me, and he says that he&amp;#39;s bad at hurting/upsetting/letting down people. Basically, after that, I told him I was upset he wasn&amp;#39;t upfront with me before, and he just says that it was casual until recently. We go back and forth a bit, and I ask if he understood where I was coming from. He tells me that we weren&amp;#39;t exclusive, and when he knew it wasn&amp;#39;t going to go anywhere with us, that he let me know. The thing is, I don&amp;#39;t recall him &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; actually saying this to me, and when I asked him when that happened, all he said was, &amp;quot;It doesn&amp;#39;t matter.&amp;quot; I didn&amp;#39;t want to end it on a bad note, so I let him know that I was happy for him and I hope that works out for him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, yeah, of course I&amp;#39;m upset. I&amp;#39;m upset because I&amp;#39;m new to the same sex dating scene- and I mean, actual dating, and not just hooking up. This is big for me because I still consider myself to be bi, to an extent. My first time at a gay bar was with this guy, heck, my first time showing affection to a guy in public was with this guy. And granted, I know in myself that I am a very emotional person, in that when I care for someone it&amp;#39;s completely, but I thought we had a connection. I made it pretty clear to him &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; times that I was into him. Guess I was stupid for trying if he was talking to this other guy &amp;quot;on and off again for a year&amp;quot;...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, I&amp;#39;m also calling this another failed attempt at finding someone to date. Ever since I made the conscious decision to focus on serious dating, I try to tell myself that I&amp;#39;m not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; crazy or I&amp;#39;m not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; unattractive, but situations like these make it harder to keep telling myself that, especially going into Valentine&amp;#39;s Day...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if I asked any question at all, but any words of encouragement and advice are appreciated. Thanks. &lt;/p&gt;

Basically I started talking to this guy and we agreed to fuck.

I am at his place and in the moment I fucked him without a condom because I am a complete idiot. I am also an idiot because I was under the impression you could only get HIV if you were bottoming. 

I topped and everything went fine there was no pain or anything. Tons of lube and nothing felt wrong it was over pretty quickly actually haha. 

But after looking into it it seems that I can possibly get HIV from topping a positive person? Do I have a right to be terrified? My dick doesn't have any cuts and there was no blood during anal? 

Should I be as scared as I am? (which is terrified) 

Thanks for any feedback.

So here goes everything. 

Yet again, I've fallen in love (yes, I'm sure it's love) with someone that is completely closeted again, and have no idea what to do...

I met this guy when I moved into school; we're the exact same person, in almost every way shape and form. When I met him he was ""straight""- until I noticed he started asking questions like, ""Do you find me attractive?"", ""When did you know that you were bi?"", ""What kind of people are you attracted to?"". Then he would just keep talking to be about the gay culture; asking me more questions like, ""So, would you call me a cub then?"". A bit after moving in we became incredibly close friends- like I see you every day- close friends. We keep having these deep talks about our sexuality, and every time we're around each other the sexual tension just keeps growing. Its now to the point where all of our other friends are placing bets to when we're going to start dating. 

Time passes and we go on winter break; We still keep in close contact, texting back and fourth every day. 

We come back from break and we see each other again; the tension grows every time still. Now, I become emotionally attached. Which I realize is the worst thing I let happen. Later on this semester, he finds out I have a date with a girl and becomes incredibly surrounded of the idea that I'm seeing someone else- something I thought he wouldn't be so interested in; he gets incredibly hung up about it, and -even though her and I don't talk anymore- he still asks about the situation. Just last night, I realize that I had one of those moments where I thought we were going to kiss, and nothing happened. 

I'm just tired of being alone and could really use some help about what to do.

So let me tell you a bit about myself. I am a bisexual male. I have strong sexual feelings for guys, and hardly any for women. I have no romantic interest in guys, but would love to have a woman to care for, spoil and cuddle. So yeah. I'm bisexual I guess and not in the straightforward sense.

So anyway. I am now 24 and up until this year I have only ever had 1 sexual experience in my life. That was when I hooked-up with a guy from a site and I met him in a carpark and sucked him off. I didn't do much for me; it was pitch black, cold and he had to finish himself and I was let down to say the least.

Anyway that was over a year ago. Fast forward to January 2015, and the past month. I have had sex with 4 guys. All hook-ups either through Grindr or other sites. Mostly oral although I did bottom once (and never again). I'm finding this all a bit crazy that I've gone my whole life without any sexual contact (considering the introverted person I am this isn't much surprise). All of a sudden I'm now counting 4 guys I've been with this year! That makes me feel a bit crazy since I could never imagine myself doing this shit.

I've enjoyed it don't get me wrong, but I just wonder if this is what I want to keep doing since I'm not really sure it is in the longer term. But then again, I face this problem where I want sex from guys and not girls, but want a relationship with a girl but no sex. Needless to say I am very confused to say the least. I don't know if the 'hookup' lifestyle is for me. I mean in the long term it surely isn't satisfying.

I have not revealed my bisexuality to ANYBODY (other than the guys i've met obviously). I really don't know where to go from here and would appreciate people's honest opinions.

This arrangement has worked so far for us and we have been tactful around our play time with others. 

So here is the story: I had a work trip to this quaint town in New England so I invited my bf to come along so we could both get out of the city and spend time together. 

On Saturday night, after having a few drinks, I decided to talk about maybe closing our relationship and his thoughts on doing so progressively to explore how it would change our dynamic and how we feel towards each other. We are both in love with one another and have made a strong connection in a relatively short time period. Needless to say, I love him and I don't think I would meet anyone like him if we break up and by no means I want to do so, yet.

Back to the story, that night we agreed to start thinking about it, didn't have sex and just fell asleep embracing each other. The next morning, I went to work for a couple of hours and we decided to meet for lunch. After lunch, he told me he had to do something urgent for work and had to go to a cafe and insisted I check out this art gallery on my own he had already visited the day before. I suspected something was up but did not say anything.

He called me a few hours later asking me where I wanted to have dinner at and if I wanted to go see a movie. He sounded sweeter than usual.

At dinner, I felt annoyed and sensed something was up. We ended up getting in an argument for me criticizing him. He even asked why I wanted to be with him if all I do is point out his flaws-- Which in a sense can be true since I can be critical at times, but so is he.

During the argument he told me he had gone to meet up with a guy he had been chatting on grindr and not to do work at the cafe. He told me he got fucked by this guy and that they ended up having friends in common. I asked him why he did it and he told me he just had the impulse of doing so based on the conversation we had the previous night. He told me he felt like he needed to confirm that he is not ready for a monogamous relationship and that we simply aren't there yet. I felt jealous and hurt but also confused on how I was feeling.

We have very lenient rules about hooking up with others (only nsa fun is allowed, going on actual romantic dates with others are not allowed nor is hooking up with friends in common). Bottom line,  I never expected him to, first of all, lie and ditch me to go have sex with someone else while I'm hanging out with him. It took me a bit to process how I felt about the situation but now I know that my feelings are hurt and I might even feel resentful towards him.

He ended up leaving on Sunday morning and I, wanting to get even, went on grindr and fucked a guy before taking my train back into the city. I also went out last night to my neighborhood gay bar and ended up making out with one of his friends, who is also in an open relationship. 

This situation has triggered something in me that wants to get back to him, to get even and I realize this is not healthy. Of course I'm not going to tell him about my adventures as he tends to be more jealous than I, but i think I'm doing these things out of pain and frustration. 

So help me here. Am I overreacting? considering he played within our established rules. Should I try to get over it and move past it or should I feel the pain and talk to him about it? I'm hurt by the lying and feeling ditched and feeling undesired-- like he would rather fuck a stranger than me. I'm not sure how to move forward with this, for now I just know I want some space to think and understand how I'm feeling. 

I would appreciate any words of advice.

I NEED YOUR GUYS HELP!**

(before you go nazi, sorry for incorrect grammar)

*Hey guys i'm not sure where to start, but i guess i'll start with some quick facts about me. 

*My name is Kristian and i'm 18 years old. I'm really shy to new people and are shy even after i get close to someone. I don't talk alot when in a group of people*

The reason i'm here today is because i need guidance for my fucked up life.

* Daniel is not his real name but i don't want to reveal it

* Lan party = A group of people getting together with their computers and play together

* This is the first time i ever reveal im actually gay even online

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So let's begin!

**Me meeting Daniel**

All this started after my school closed after 8th grade and had to take my 9th grade at another school. This didn't fit me at all since i'm a very nervous guy that can't keep eye contact and just litteraly sucks getting new friends. I didn't really have some ""real"" friends at my other school but it didn't bother me because i wasn't harrased or anything. But as school started after summer vacation and got into class i quickly briefed over to see who i'm going to spend my next year with and then i saw this guy, let's call him Simon. He sat back in the chair had surfer shorts on, flip flops, and a half-tight t-shirt on. Beautiful brown hair and a nice tan. He wasn't really muscular or anything but i just felt connected to him somehow.

So i guess 5-6 weeks into school we had to some type of individual report that we had 2 or 3 days to do and had to use computers, i didn't bother using the school laptops so i brought my own. Day 1 of report i got bored from the report after about 2 hours work and just closed Word, to stare for a while. That's when i heard ""Are you a gamer?"" A lightning strike through my spine and cold drops of sweat running down my neck, It was Daniel talking to me for the first time he never talked to me but i knew it was him because i've heard him talk to other peope in the class ofcourse, but i couldn't believe he was talking to me so i ignored it, that's when he went over to sit next to me and start talking. He was just as amazing as i thought he would be, and yes he was a gamer too. Since then we have been really good friends and even tho we didn't went to the same school after 9th grade we kept in touch over skype and held LAN parties together with other friends.

**First Sexual Encounter**

This was in 9th grade we had a skiing trip where we would live in cabins of 8 people of our own choosing. Me and Daniel and some of my new friends too decided to live in the same cabin, where there would be 2 master beds and 4, 1 person beds. I didn't mind sleeping in one of the master beds ofcourse cause i'm gay, so after i said that Daniel quickly responded that he didn't mind either and said he'll sleep next to me. So on the first night when we went to sleep and said goodnight about after 5-10 minutes he took his hand under my carpet and touched my lower thighs. I was shocked and removed my leg instantly without saying a word, neither did Daniel said anything. Nothing more happend that night except me regretting for hours that i removed my leg.

**The Second Encounter**

The next day we went skiing together and when we got back to the cabin we were sweaty but didn't bother taking a bath, this aroused ofcourse because i love the smell of his scent, so i got playfully and started teasing him with my right foot. He didn't bother at first but then he suddenly grabs my foot really hard and pushes it away looking at me with a wierd smirk i didn't know what to do with, so i teased him and said ""Dude that really hurt"" very sarcasticly. He then looked at me and asked if he wanted me to kiss it(*as in a mom kissing her childs wound to make everything better*) I didn't resist and said sure. He then grabs my right foot with both his hands and slowly kisses the top of my foot just under the toes closing his eyes meanwhile. I don't know for sure if he took a whiff of my smelly socked feet or he is just really tolerant with feet and don't mind them.. But i just said ""Thanks"" and after that we just watched TV again.. Nothing more happend on that trip

**Follow up Foot Encounters**


Now over the past 4 years you we've had been to alot of LAN parties together and there often is not much room to sleep on couches etc. so we just have mattresses on the floor. As often as possible i try to have my mattress close to Daniel's feet and when he goes to sleep i play with them. He is a semi deep sleeper so it's not too hard but he is also ticklish so i have to be carefull when doing. I think maybe twice he had woke up and just told me to stop then going back to sleep. At the LAN party we often watch a lot of movies to then we lay down on the couch and i again, as often as possible try to place my head close to his feet without it being overly obvious. This leads to my final ""encounter"" which happend at the last LAN party we had date; Friday 6th - Sunday 8th February

We were just starting to watch a movie and i successfully placed my upper chest just inches away from his feet. We have blankets over our bodies tho but i can feel his feet against my chest through it. So while the intro is rolling i can feel his feet moving around, but quickly realise that he is actually somewhat cuddling me, i look up at him and he just smiles and look at my reaction, i smile back and look into his eyes. He keeps cuddling for a few seconds but then stops and continue to watch the movie, as do i.

**Additional Info**

**We often have long eye contacts where none of us say anything**

**We've never talked about ANY of these encounters**

**We often write ""&lt;3"" and "";-*"" when we send messages to one another**



So now what i need help with is

* Is Daniel also Gay?

* Does he have a foot fetish too?

* What should i do? I'm so scared to lose him as a friend

**Feel free to ask for more specific info!!!**
