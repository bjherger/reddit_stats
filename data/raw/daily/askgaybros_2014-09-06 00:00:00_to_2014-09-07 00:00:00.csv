My ""reason"" for this was something stupid along the lines of ""It would be a-lot harder for me to even be with a man so I guess ill just look at them and get it out of my system."" Which now i realize how stupid that really is. I feel as if now I want more I want to be with a man just as much or more as a women. I mean yes I am still attracted to women and there are some out there that I would do anything with. But now a days the only thing going through my head is men. I couldn't really deny it any more and finally just accepted it (which was a-lot of weight off my shoulders) Yesterday I went and asked my Gay friend out and came out to him and told him. He was very happy that I came to him and told him and even offered to help me get my foot in the door and meet people. But I guess im still just confused about everything, I dont know what to think of it all. 

Not to mention im attracted to the opposite of my body type. I am 5'10 145, yet im attracted to guys like 220 big manly muscular-ish bearish men. And from the little knowledge of what I know, is that its harder to find those type of guys who are into smaller guys like me. Not to mention I have the curse of the baby face and i look like im 16 (im 21). (I went to Vegas and sat at a table for one hour, with in that hour I got ID 15 times) So just all of that makes me feel, Odd?Scared?Hopeless? Not to mention im still a virgin and the community is very sex driven. I don't really know what to do or to think, my brain never turns off which makes it worse. So im coming here for some advice.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have just recently with in the last 2 months finally accepted my sexuality (BI)But im still confused and scared about things.

Were long distance so when we see each other there's usually a lot of sex. But once he was blowing me and I just couldn't cum and I kept losing my boner.

First, I should probably give some background. I'm a young guy, 21, and I'm a junior in college. I make enough money with my job to pay for my schooling and books and still have some leftover to play with. More than some, actually. I generally have about three to four thousand extra dollars left over after paying for all my bills of the year. Second, I've been hooking up pretty regularly with an older man, 42, for almost a year now. I'll call him Ben. I don't want to hear anything about the age, we both approached each other thinking the other was a different age. Ben is a social worker, divorced, and has 3 kids. I don't interact with his family or friends, but we've been meeting up about once a week for a year. We get along very well, and I consider him a friend.

Recently, Ben got in trouble at work. He tells me that in his industry, it's fairly common for social workers to bill for up to half an hour longer than they actually spend with their clients, due to client inconsistency in keeping appointments. That said, back in May one of Ben's clients was talked to by the police for possession of marijuana, and she ended up saying something about how Ben spends so long with her during their sessions. This led to investigation on Ben, who when found out, was asked to resign, not fired. Ben has been without a job since. He donates plasma, and has a little bit of money to last him for a short while, but that's running out. As he explains it, the state says he owes $13,000 in medicaid(?, may be medicare) fraud, and he could face prison time, but that is unlikely. He says when he added it up himself, he only owes about $6,000. At this point in time, Ben is at the end of his money and may have to sell his house, due to being unable to pay the mortgage. He thinks his wealthy sister may purchase it for him and then he'll gradually pay her back, but he doesn't want to bring it up. Ben is rather embarrassed about the whole situation, and it has ruined his life so far. He doesn't know for sure if they are going to blacklist him from billing medicare, but he knows that he will no longer be able to counsel. 

As to what I'm asking, I feel terrible for Ben. I know our relationship isn't built on too much, but when you've known somebody for a year and you get along, being friends isn't too hard. I would really like to help in some way, but I'm limited in both funds, influence and experience. Plus, I'm pretty sure that my help would be inappropriate unless I had enough money or influence to help in a significant way anyways. What can I do, if I should?
