So, my brothers, pick your favourite!

https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/3450036.Harvey_Milk","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today is Harvey Milk&amp;#39;s birthday - and he&amp;#39;s being honoured with his own stamp at the White House today.  For any newbies - check out the film MILK, and the doc &amp;quot;The Times of Harvey Milk&amp;quot; - be inspired and empowered by the bravery and message of this man who was taken from us far too soon.  You&amp;#39;ll be even more proud to be a member of the gay communities the more you learn about Milk and the many who continue his work.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Birthday, brother.  And than you for opening the doors for all of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was going to leave a quote of his, but there are so many worth reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, my brothers, pick your favourite!&lt;/p&gt;
