As the title suggests, I’m a bi(curios) guy with some questions.

I've always considered myself to be somewhat bisexual. I actually made out with a friend back in HS, but I eventually never had sex with him (probably the reason why our friendship ended).
Since then, I had only heterosexual relations and I was with a nice girl for many years. Now that I’m free again, I am considering exploring my bi-side. The problem is that I’m not young anymore (late 20s) and have substantially zero experience.

So, here my questions:

* How awkward is for an inexperienced late-20s guy to look for a date/fwb? Is it like a late-20s straight virgin guy? I have friends that fall in the latter category and I know that it’s quite awkward.

* In other words, are there people (around my age or younger) potentially interested in an average-looking inexperienced white-Hispanic top (correct terminology?) of my age?

* Size matters a lot? My (American and non-American) female partners never complained about my sub-average/average uncut friend, but I have this idea that gay guys really care about that.

* The community is generally discreet? I’m not ashamed of my sexual interests and I live in an lgbt-friendly area, but I have a quite sensitive job and don’t want people to use stuff against me. Just to be clear, I have to be careful even when dating girls.

* Is there any discrimination (in USA) toward people with specific ideas/faith? I.e. should I somewhat hide my faith and political affiliation? 

Any other suggestions?

Thanks!

Now while I'm basically starting from scratch for my job hunt, he has a significant advantage for his career path if he stays out there.  He has been planning on coming back east but i just found out that was only because he wants to be with me as opposed to propelling his future out there. Clearly I dont want him to let me get in the way of his future!  
  
Now to the fun part.  We were talking last night and I got the idea that i should just pick up my essentials and ship myself out there, get a simple job to get by and save a little while he gets ahead in his industry.  While i have an alright monetary cushion atm, with loans needed to be paid it wont last too long if i dont change what i'm doing now.

Yeah, do that math as well and get over it if it bugs you :-)  Our state has marriage equality, and last night he proposed to me. I screamed YES! and spent the next half-hour crying from happiness! I love him more than anything and I want to spend the rest of my life with him. Please, no negative comments or lectures directed at our age difference or my decision. My life, not yours. But... my parents are going to freak out. Not because I'm gay - they have known since I was 14 and have been VERY supportive of me (PFLAG and everything). They have loved it when I brought home guys my age. I had my first real BF at 15 and have actually had quite a few over the years. I live in a large city, so I have been able to meet people easily. Once I turned 18 and started dating significantly older guys, my parents became very prickly and have suggested that I should really stick to guys close to my age. They know my fiancé and like him at one level. They should, since he was friends with them first and that's how I met him. They thought I should have a gay professional role model. (Note: He had only recently moved to our city. It's not like he was someone I knew growing up or anything like that. I was almost 19 when we met). I only recently told them that we had been dating. They were most definitely NOT pleased and asked me to consider breaking it off and dating other (younger) people. One of my brothers also told me that my parents are uncomfortable with the fact that he is white. My family is Asian. If I were engaged to a 22 year-old Asian guy, they would probably turn cartwheels on the front lawn. They are going to freak when I tell them about this. Does anyone have any constructive advice or experience in a similar situation? I hate so much that this is most likely going to be hurtful to them, but this is not some fling or snap decision by a room-temperature-IQ twink:  I am 22; this is legal where we live; I've basically been living with him for 2 of the past 3 years (but my parents don't actually know this; campus roommate has loved the arrangement, of course); I graduate college in 6 weeks with no student loans; I start grad school for biomedical engineering in the fall; BTW, he's a medical doctor; and most importantly I love him totally and I know he is the one for me.

This is a rant and explanation

Throughout my life I've felt like I was the worse, with negative self esteem. After I while I just accepted that I'd never find a man, I had my lifelong friends and that was enough. After I moved from my home country to the USA I found out that I am (sort of) attractive and became a slut. 

Got back to my home country/city, start feeling like crap. After a while I recover some of the confidence I had while in the US, though still never considering finding a boyfriend. At a party I met this guy, who was into me and I was into him, we click beautifully. 

Being around this dude for 2 months were the best 2 months of my life. I actually considered spending my life in my home city if I had him by my side (I wanna move out of here desperately). So things turn to shit and he breaks up. I'm devastated and worse than ever. We try to keep our friendship. 

First meeting afterwards, fight, he cries. Second I try to kiss him and found out he was dating a friend of ours, fight 2, we both cry. Third and fourth, I bump I into him while with a friend and treat him like garbage. Fifth, I found out he broke up and immediately proceeds to hook with a random guy, again a fight because I finally tell him that he simply doesn't know what the fuck he wants for his future, claims to want to marry yet change boyfriends like a change of clothes. Cries really bad, I feel like shit afterwards. 

Do you know what's the worst I feel? I still fucking care about  him, and he still cares about me.

I have been dating my boyfriend for about 2 and a half years now, I love him a lot and I believe him when he says he loves me. We are still living in separate places for now.


I always work 3pm-11pm Monday to Friday and sometimes forced on Saturdays too, last year he took an office job that works at 7am so it started conflicting with how much we see each other.


So from the start I told him I was vers top. He is bottom but said he would top now and then.. but he has this issue, he can't stay hard and says doctors he talked with don't know why, he has tried a bunch of natural pills, some helped but had side effects. Lately tho he has no interest in figuring out why, has just accepted it.


He has no interest in ""kinky"" stuff, besides BJ and me topping (depending how his stomach feels) that's most of it, he has topped me maybe 3 times our whole time together, now is grossed out by rimming and doesn't like fingering. 


I went a long time not asking to switch positions because he is sensitive to the E.D. Obviously, but I have been trying to get him to try again as I need to switch now and then. But it usually leads to argument and then nothing. 


I've suggested for him to just go as long as he can and we just flip and I take over, even suggested him using dildo on me even tho I wouldn't enjoy that as the emotional connections not there. 


Some fights have led to him saying I deserve better, to him suggestion a 3 way which was sarcasm, but some stuff he says leads my intuition to think he has no sexual appeal and wants to break up but loves me and doesn't know how. 


We both did gain some weight after meeting, but my new years plan was to go back to the gym and quit smoking, which I think I have been doing pretty good. But his view of working out is just going for bike rides or walks (there's still snow here) and refuses to join a gym. I've lost 8 pounds so far which bums him out.
 

I'm sorry for this being so long and if you made it this far I would be glad to see what kind of thoughts you may have, or if know a good natural supplements to help too.. I just needed to vent and seek advice as when I try to talk to him about the sex stuff he gets so defensive and says why don't you break up with me and find somebody else then. I probably could have wrote more, but I shouldn't compete with lord of the rings lol

I just want to add too, his friend Steve who he talks about wanting to meet up for coffee lots but stuff gets in the way.

We were 24 then, 26 now. I’ll call him Leo.

This was October 2013. I was at my best friend Leo’s house, late. Though I felt we were soul mates, and I think he’s beautiful, I didn’t harbor romantic feelings for Leo. The thought crossed my mind, but I find it pretty easy to dismiss attraction to straight friends and to keep hopeless love from starting.

We aren’t sober, we aren’t wrecked. We’re talking, and up comes the subject of body image. Both of us are usually depressed, and irrationally lack confidence when we’re down. He says he’s worried about a dot on his dick, whether it’s an STI, etc. The talk maneuvers into Leo asking me to take a look and give my opinion (he’s afraid of doctors)… but only if I show him mine too. For someone as private and reserved as this guy, it was beyond out of character-- it was surreal. I agreed. He shows me, I say that he seemed just fine, but get checked out if you’re still concerned. Then it’s my turn, I show him, while he looks as petrified as he’d be looking straight down the edge of a cliff. 

Then I try to get things back to normal. But he’s gone mute, he’s swinging a baseball bat around like he’s hypnotized, he gets audibly nauseous and barely avoids throwing up. I start to worry, ask him if he’s feeling sick. History’s longest minute passes.

The dam breaks. He’s had romantic feelings for me for five or six years, he thinks the root of his depression and addictions is a tortured sexual identity, he’s attracted to women but fantasizes about spending his life with me. His voice is shaking and he’s overwhelmed and near tears. Maybe I was naïve, but I was in shock to hear it. I had no clue how to react. He was so sincere, he was so vulnerable, maybe I’d like all those things too, shit like this always ruins friendships, will he hurt himself if I say the wrong thing, could I really make him happy, this could be incredible and fun and beautiful. 

Leo chokes out that he’d wondered about what it would be like if I kissed him, and maybe I could now. Maybe, he says, it would let him know if all his feelings were real. I sit there quietly for a minute, with the scale in my head… lust, love, and worry versus reason and friendship. I move my chair next to Leo’s, we look at each other, I lean over and kiss him. 

Completely electric. I'd never felt so human. We kiss in a pretty innocent way, for a minute or two, and it’s over. The first thing he says is “Yeah… it’s real.” Before the night’s over, he says that we have two ways to go: keep things the way they are, or try some kind of relationship. I was scared but said let’s go for it, take it slow, ease into it.

It was all downhill from there. A week of tension and pretending like things were the same, not talking about that night, and then he essentially disowns everything he said. He didn’t do it in heartless way, and I saw it coming, he apologized up and down. Within a month Leo had a girlfriend, I childishly made every excuse not to meet her and to see him as little as possible. My dad got diagnosed with cancer and my attention shifted to taking care of him. 

When my dad died last July, Leo was the person who watered the plants and collected the mail at my house. He was the first person I told, and my only friend who came to the memorial. He’s a great friend, which is all I ever wanted him to be, and all I ever wanted to be to him. 

I’ve distanced myself from Leo. When I see him, I try hard to make things the way they were, but it’s forced. I think that he’s so deeply in denial that he is lying to me and to himself, and it’s painful to be around. I think he was telling the truth that night. I’m convinced of it, and my conviction has led me to think about him romantically, and I can’t interact with him the way I used to without it feeling phony. I should have been strong enough to stop it before it started, but that night I felt like he needed me, and since then I see him differently. Leo’s keenly aware that things have deteriorated and it hurts him. It hurts me too, but what happened happened.

Am I to blame for this disaster? If it’s on me to get over it, to fix things, how do I? Pride isn’t my problem. I feel like he’s living a lie and I’m disturbed having to play a part.

tl;dr: a longtime friend of mine and I had an intense night where he revealed having feelings for me and we shared a kiss. He abruptly denied all of it a week later, and since then I’ve been unable to get back to our friendship the way it was. Wondering if I’m being spiteful or if it’s just a lost cause.

His voice is shaking and he’s overwhelmed and near tears. Maybe I was naïve, but I was in shock to hear it. I had no clue how to react. He was so sincere, he was so vulnerable, maybe I’d like all those things too, shit like this always ruins friendships, will he hurt himself if I say the wrong thing, could I really make him happy, this could be incredible and fun and beautiful. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leo chokes out that he’d wondered about what it would be like if I kissed him, and maybe I could now. Maybe, he says, it would let him know if all his feelings were real. I sit there quietly for a minute, with the scale in my head… lust, love, and worry versus reason and friendship. I move my chair next to Leo’s, we look at each other, I lean over and kiss him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Completely electric. I&amp;#39;d never felt so human. We kiss in a pretty innocent way, for a minute or two, and it’s over. The first thing he says is “Yeah… it’s real.” Before the night’s over, he says that we have two ways to go: keep things the way they are, or try some kind of relationship. I was scared but said let’s go for it, take it slow, ease into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was all downhill from there. A week of tension and pretending like things were the same, not talking about that night, and then he essentially disowns everything he said. He didn’t do it in heartless way, and I saw it coming, he apologized up and down. Within a month Leo had a girlfriend, I childishly made every excuse not to meet her and to see him as little as possible. My dad got diagnosed with cancer and my attention shifted to taking care of him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When my dad died last July, Leo was the person who watered the plants and collected the mail at my house. He was the first person I told, and my only friend who came to the memorial. He’s a great friend, which is all I ever wanted him to be, and all I ever wanted to be to him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve distanced myself from Leo. When I see him, I try hard to make things the way they were, but it’s forced. I think that he’s so deeply in denial that he is lying to me and to himself, and it’s painful to be around. I think he was telling the truth that night. I’m convinced of it, and my conviction has led me to think about him romantically, and I can’t interact with him the way I used to without it feeling phony. I should have been strong enough to stop it before it started, but that night I felt like he needed me, and since then I see him differently. Leo’s keenly aware that things have deteriorated and it hurts him. It hurts me too, but what happened happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am I to blame for this disaster? If it’s on me to get over it, to fix things, how do I? Pride isn’t my problem. I feel like he’s living a lie and I’m disturbed having to play a part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading, those who did. Here’s some great new music to enjoy:

&lt;p&gt;tl;dr: a longtime friend of mine and I had an intense night where he revealed having feelings for me and we shared a kiss. He abruptly denied all of it a week later, and since then I’ve been unable to get back to our friendship the way it was. Wondering if I’m being spiteful or if it’s just a lost cause.&lt;/p&gt;

So I figured this is a good place to vocalize it. Growing up I was always the unathletic kid, very skinny, and honestly pretty flamboyant so it wasn't much of a surprise that occasionally I got called gay which growing up bothered me a bit. Eventually I got over it and if someone called me gay or asked me I was perfectly fine just correcting them because it really wasn't an issue. Eventually in high school I got a girlfriend and for almost 8 years now we've been together. I've felt happy, comfortable, safe, attracted, and satisfied with this relationship. I still do. But recently I developed this anxiety which I think stemmed from a multitude of factors. First my girlfriend hinted marriage which wasn't on its own a problem because we've discussed it and I've had thoughts about it on my own. But while in a happy hour with coworkers and my boss (who is gay) he mentioned how he was married for some years before coming to terms with his sexuality or at least coming out. And that thought scared me. So I thought well how does anyone know? Then this made me wonder well is this something that people question? So I made the weird error of googling Sexuality quesitoning etc which lead to a bunch of weird sites ranging from its a spectrum to gods watching you etc. So in the mean time I'm trying to be open with myself maybe admitting that I may not be as straight as I thought but the anxiety comes and goes. 

What annoys me is a that as a whole I've never really had an issue admitting that a man is attractive. I think a good looking person is a good looking person and I always assumed it was something every one is aware of even if they may feel like its weird to admit. And I don't think there is anything wrong with being gay. And trying to honestly think about it I've never really felt a sexual or emotional attraction to any man. At least one that I remember? 

So I'm trying to really feel through this anxiety to see if I am just repressing something. And though I'm not religious myself I grew up in an environment where homosexuality is not really readily accepted (which I always thought was bull anyway). So the fact that I'm having these thoughts kind of gives me this general anxiety because I'm not sure what to make of this. I know for a fact that I don't want to end a great relationship that I've culminated and loved, and nothing in the world would be more painful than hurting her because she's someone that's so important to me and gives me so much that I just don't really want from anyone else. But I feel like I haven't had an outlet for this anxiety. So I'm not sure if I'm just freaking out over this changing image of myself. Am I not as straight as I've just assumed? Does it matter? Do people really know about themselves completely? I think the fact that this thought popped into my head just really threw me for a loop and made me feel uncomfortable with the idea that maybe I dont know myself like I thought  I did. So then I did another weird test. I'm a moderately avid porn watcher. I've never looked at gay porn except I guess lesbian porn, though I guess that's targeted for a straight audience, but usually toy things. So I thought maybe if I see some gay porn and nothing happens it will calm me down. So then I randomly searched some and I kind of got a semi, not super full on but it was just strange. So that completely freaked me out and its been moderately difficult to get the same reaction out of my usual favorites. So I feel like I'm a mess of thoughts right now and this anxiety keeps coming and going so I needed to just say it somewhere. 

So askgaybros thanks for listening I feel like I needed to get that out there one way or the other.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently I&amp;#39;ve developed this strong anxiety about my sexuality.

I'm a very out gay dude who had the benefit of being really secure in my identity from a young age and was privileged enough to feel safe coming out pretty early (what I'm trying to get at is I never went through much of the inner turmoil and stress around figuring out my sexuality/coming out that a lot of folks do, and don't have a whole lot of background into what that's like, which is kinda the premise of my problem).

I play in a band and about three months ago give or take, one of my bandmate's friends who lives a few hours away drove out to see a show. I noticed he was mad attractive and we started to talk outside and really quickly hit it off, he managed to find me on Facebook and instagram later that same night, and started dropping comments on all of my stuff, etc. Didn't really take it for much, but a day or two later I saw him at another show and we hit it off again, he seemed really excited to see me even though we'd only met once, and a few days after that I posted on Facebook that I'd be dropping by the town he lives in (I have some friends there) if anyone would want to hang out. He immediately messaged me about hanging out, sending me his number over Facebook and saying I should text him. We ended up hanging out that night until pretty late and he introduced me to a bunch of his friends.

From there we very quickly became good friends. A few days later he offered to pick me up from the airport, and we went up and both spent the night at a friends house where we ended up sleeping on the same small couch together. By this point we'd talk or interact every day without fail (this is about three weeks or so after I met him), and he offered to let me spend the night at his parent's house one night because I was gonna be down for a friend's birthday and needed a place to stay. I decided it'd be a good idea to drop that I was gay before I got too entrenched with this guy, so that night I very casually mentioned it and he seemed pretty happy about hearing that. I met his mom the next day, which I thought would be weird, but was oddly nice, she knew a lot about me and kept on saying how it was so nice to finally meet me.

A week or so later, I ended up impromptu coming down and spending the night at his place, and he convinced me to stay in town for a few extra days, during which we spent most of the time just hanging out with each other or briefly in the company of other friends. By this point I'd known him for maybe a month and a half but we were already insanely close, we'd often hang out and talk about lots of pretty personal feelings with each other.

It got to the point where even though we live about two hours driving apart, we'd see each other three or four times a week, where he'd either drive up and hang out or often times he'd very insistently convince me to bus down to where he lives and hang out. Whenever we'd hang out we'd spend the whole time together regardless of the contexts, and at parties would often end up off by ourselves on a couch or in a corner talking. A mutual friend (his best friend) would even often make jokes about us being in a romantic relationship. One night at a show we ended up pressed up against each other to the point where we were more or less vertically spooning if that makes sense (can't think of a better way of describing it haha) and I thought about pulling away to not make him uncomfortable, but decided against it. He half held me there like that for the next half hour or so, and started whispering jokes and funny comments in my ear. After that deal he got way more into asking to hang out, and pretty much daily would ask if I was planning on making the trip down to catch a show or hang out with anyone. I spent the night at his house later that same week and he started talking a lot about his ideal relationship and romantic interests. He kept on using ambiguous, gender neutral terms (I know he's dated two girls for brief periods of time and gone on casual dates with others, although he's always been insistent that he's only ever felt physically attracted towards them and never felt emotionally that attached) and talking about how he likes it when you don't force a relationship and it instead stems from two people who start off as friends and then grow to have feelings for each other. He then said he wasn't actively pursuing anyone right now but that he by no means would be opposed to starting a relationship with someone if they expressed interest and were honest with him.

I went home not thinking that much about that interaction, but all my friends hounded me telling me I had blown it and should've said something. I saw him a few days later at a show and the same sort of touching went on, however he seemed oddly distant and quiet. I sent him a text the next day explaining how I felt (I only texted him mostly because I wasn't sure when I'd see him next due to geographical distance and my friends were all on my case to say something so he wouldn't get the impression that I didn't like him).

He responded saying he wasn't interested in men like that and was really sorry if he had led me on, but that he had also suspected I might feel that way for a while. We talked about it a lot and both made it clear we wanted to stay friends (on a very platonic level I consider him a great friend), and the conversation stemma off at a pretty reasonable, ok point.

That was about a week and a half ago, and my dilemma is every single day since then he's texted me and sent me funny messages and jokes. We have a group text with two of hour other very close friends and often times I'll say something on there and he'll directly respond to what I say with pretty provocative, suggestive jokes and windy faces or ask me lots of questions about things I say when it's clear the conversation has already moved on. I get trying to make things seem normal and friendly, but the extent to which he's doing it feels really weird and is making it really hard to move on.

My two friends who are in a queer relationship are both convinced he's confused about how he feels. My question is, do any of you who have more experience dealing with feelings of confusion and identity issues have any insight that could help? I really have no idea what to make of this and want to keep him as a good friend but am not totally sure how to navigate that/what to make of this situation!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;aight my bros, I need some advice on this one.

Hello Broskis',

It's been about 2 days since that post. I just want to start off by saying, Thank you guys so much for everything. I read all the comments, at least 3 times each. I didn't go to sleep that night until 2 AM maybe...and that was because I took a sleeping pill, because my emotions were just all over the place which wouldn't let me fall asleep on my own. 

I wanted to respond to each and everyone of you, but that night it was just too much handle for me to even write back...and there was just so much to say lol. 

Now that I have had a chance to breathe and look back at the situation, I am much more calm and level headed. I again want to say thank you so much to all the bros who commented. You guys were real, honest, genuine and sincere with your responses...and frankly, that's what I needed. Some tough love just to bring me back to Earth. I'm not lying when I say I spend a good chunk of my time on this subreddit. You guys are an incredible bunch. Like I said in the original post, I really just wanted someone to vent to, because I can't go to my family or friends for these types of situations, and you guys really came through. 

I guess I'll just touch on some points that alot of you made:

- First and foremost, as I mentioned in the post, I am a very logical person and always think before I act. always. I can't turn it off. With that said, I can easily say this was probably the first instance in my life when my emotions took COMPLETE control of me. I was aware the entire time I was acting like a crazy psycho, but I couldn't stop myself. And honestly it just freaked me the hell out...I need to learn to keep this stuff in check before I some other type of episode like this.

- Yes, I have very deep rooted insecurities of myself. The biggest reason for that is my parents. Since I was very small they always compared me to either my other family members or kids of their friends.. EG:""John is in soccer, karate and basketball...why do you spend all of your time locked up inside drawing and writing?"" ""Sam is working on a car with his dad. Why don't you know anything about cars?"" ""Jeff is in 7 AP classes...why aren't you?"" ""Rick is going on dates like every other week. Why have you only had 1 serious girlfriend?"" 
That's all I heard growing up, and basically up until I finished college. Which of course, all my life I was meant to think I'm not good enough for anyone...Currently, joke's on them really, because of all those people he has compared me to in my life, I am the only one who has truly become successful. I'm 24, had a Bachelor's degree at 20, Got hired in my field a month to the day I graduated, owned my own car at 21, getting paid 50,000K / year (Granted, I have student loans and am working to pay those off), have paid for health care, a 401K, and pay everything for myself. Yes my life so far has worked out pretty great, but 20-something years of that psychological torture can fuck you up pretty bad and still live deep in you. If this experience really taught me anything, it's that I need to work even harder on myself to get rid of those skeletons in my closet. 

- Speaking of closets, yes, I am not out. And honestly, I don't plan on coming out as a bisexual until I'm fully able to support myself. I have a financial plan to  pay off my student loans (currently at 46K debt) by the next 2-3 years. Once that is paid off, I would like to move to a new state and basically start fresh (and my home state is the lowest paid state for my field...so fuck that, Once I have a good amount of EXP I'm outta here lol). In the mean time, since I live at home, I dont want to put myself in jeopardy of losing my family (I doubt I will, they are very open people....but you never know) 

- As for the actual guy, well he still hasn't gotten back to me. I know that day, he mentioned he'd be out of town for a few days. Honestly, now that I have had time to breathe a look everything over...and with the help of all your comments, I understood that I was not in love with him, but as someone said I was in love with the affection he gave me, and that this was purely an infatuation. No, this guy was not the first guy to show me that affection, and won't be the last. When other guys show me affection, I play along, but I can tell the difference between what's real affection and what's just ""hook-up affection""... but like I said I felt something about him, that was just completely different than any other guy I have met, which clearly fucked with me and drove me to madness. 

Yesterday morning was still a bit tough. I woke up with the same knot in my stomach and felt a bit sad. But throughout the day, I actually realized, I actively have a bunch of things I need to take care of and that have deadlines (both at my actual job and I'm a freelancer as well) and that I really should be focused on those projects. I find if my mind is busy with the current task at hand, I won't think about him as much. The urge to call him yesterday was so strong, but I fought myself, and I knew better than that. I basically told myself I need to give some space between me and him. I have made up my mind, I'll reach out to him next week to see where we are. If I see he is still dodgy and unresponsive, then I'll just tell myself fuck it and move on. If he is still in to me, then, as someone said, little by little I will pursuit him and see what blossoms from there. 

Last night, I felt a weird mix of emotions: still a bit sad about him, happy I realized what I needed to do to move on but another part of me just wanted some meaningless fun with someone else to take my mind off it. I called up this dude I've known for a bit that I mess around with every now and them, told him I was horny and went off to his place. During the fun, not once did the gentleman this post is about cross my mind. After and on my way home however, I felt a bit sad again, since I wished it was him I spent that time with, and not this hookup guy, but whatever, I went home watched some TV, chatted a bit with some people and knocked out. 

Today, I feel a lot better, It seems just taking things a day at a time is really helping. Looking back on it now, that night was just so terrifying. I was really sad about him not seeing me, but I think I was even more upset at myself for feeling that way and for dealing with it the way I did. I was scared, I had never gone through something like that before, and I didn't know what to do, who to turn to or how to deal with it...which just added to my hysteria. The smartest decision I made that night was posting my story on here lol. 

Again, thank you guys a million for all the tough love! If there is any updates with this dude, I'll definitely let you know lol ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original Post &lt;a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/2yn0zc/basically_in_tearsjust_need_some_reassurance/""&gt;http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/2yn0zc/basically_in_tearsjust_need_some_reassurance/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I basically told myself I need to give some space between me and him. I have made up my mind, I&amp;#39;ll reach out to him next week to see where we are. If I see he is still dodgy and unresponsive, then I&amp;#39;ll just tell myself fuck it and move on. If he is still in to me, then, as someone said, little by little I will pursuit him and see what blossoms from there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night, I felt a weird mix of emotions: still a bit sad about him, happy I realized what I needed to do to move on but another part of me just wanted some meaningless fun with someone else to take my mind off it. I called up this dude I&amp;#39;ve known for a bit that I mess around with every now and them, told him I was horny and went off to his place. During the fun, not once did the gentleman this post is about cross my mind. After and on my way home however, I felt a bit sad again, since I wished it was him I spent that time with, and not this hookup guy, but whatever, I went home watched some TV, chatted a bit with some people and knocked out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I feel a lot better, It seems just taking things a day at a time is really helping. Looking back on it now, that night was just so terrifying. I was really sad about him not seeing me, but I think I was even more upset at myself for feeling that way and for dealing with it the way I did. I was scared, I had never gone through something like that before, and I didn&amp;#39;t know what to do, who to turn to or how to deal with it...which just added to my hysteria. The smartest decision I made that night was posting my story on here lol. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, thank you guys a million for all the tough love! If there is any updates with this dude, I&amp;#39;ll definitely let you know lol &lt;/p&gt;

I've had a hard week. It's my second week at uni and my fourth at the uni residence. I've been social (which is completely uncharacteristic of me), made some friends, and have even gotten somewhat close (platonically) to another gay guy who I genuinely like and is a good person. But... I don't know. Some days... a lot of days, I can barely even leave my room. It feels like a conscious effort just to hold myself together long enough to be out in a public area and then right back into the privacy of my room. A lot of the time, I can barely even look at anyone else because I'm just reminded of how much I'm lacking. Some days I can't even look in the mirror without wanting to kill myself. 

I thought getting substantially drunk would help me forget about all that... apparently not. Now I just feel the same way, albeit on the bathroom floor with no balance instead of in bed. Fantastic. So... I don't know. I'm out of ideas guys. I just can't do it anymore. Wish I had the courage.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So... here I am. 3:29AM, drunk, and still wishing I didn&amp;#39;t exist. I&amp;#39;ve had a hard week.
