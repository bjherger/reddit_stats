As some of you saw in the Mod post recently we are doing a census of the sub. First of all, I'd like to thank the 112 of you who have responded so far. 

To the those of you who have yet to take the survey: I implore you to please do so! It's quick, easy, and relatively painless! Hopefully the data we collect can be used to make the sub even better (though I find that rather unlikely). 

Speaking of data... since there are approximately 13,600 subscribers, we would need 374 total responses (so about 162 more) for the survey to be representative with a 95% confidence level and a confidence interval of 5. 

[The link, again, for those who have not taken it.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Abdu59vDV9VZ4Gti_6qHapmNWKrvv6QLLG5AufvkYiI/viewform?usp=send_form)

I'll probably close the survey around March 13th; hopefully 10 days later I will have all the data compiled in to neat charts and graphs. Depending on results, I may or may not conducts some statistical analysis.

I'm Joe a 32yo guy from Scotland. I'm hoping reddit can help.
I'm writing this as a form of catharsis so it will be long. I understand if no one reads or responds to it.
I've been struggling with loneliness a lot recently and I don't know how to change that. I'm gay, I've had a lot of sexual encounters/partners but I want to be in love. I've had 2 ""boyfriends"" in my life, one when I was 22yo and one when I was 31yo. Both relationships lasted less than 6 months.  I think I broke up with them because I am selfish and didn't actually feel anything deeply for them.  
There has been one guy, a friend, who I felt for.  He came out to me and friends a few years ago. We weren't strong friends before that, but afterwards we got a bit closer which I like.  We all went on holiday a few years back and I guess I started to notice him a lot more and got quite attracted to him.  Once we were back from the holiday we hung out a bit more. He opened up a bit to me one drunken night about his worries telling his family,  I saw him get upset &amp; be vulnerable and I felt for him so much. I wanted to help his a much as possible. Be supportive, listen to him. The night ended with a great hug a kiss on his cheek and a taxi home alone. I wanted to be the best friend for him. Make sure that he got the support I didn't have when I came out. I think that was the night I knew I liked him more than a friend.
Our group of friends went out one night and we ended back at his both very drunk. He asked me to come with him to his room because he didn't want to be alone that night.  I was really confused because he's never shown interest in me what so ever. We'd both had a lot to drink but I could tell he was much more drunk than I was. We got in bed and I kept my top and underwear on because I was embarrassed about my body, him being very athletic and me being very overweight.  But he continued to hug and fondle me, I got up and left because I was embarrassed and said I was going to the bathroom, I didn't go back to his room but went to the spare room instead. Lying their being panicked thinking I was taking advantage of his drunken state to get what I wanted. He came in a few minutes later and took me back to his room. We had some sex, it wasn't great, we were both drunk and I held back because I was worried about what would happen when we woke up.   So I left in the morning, both hungover, I gave him a hug and I don't think we said much.  The next few days we sent awkward messages to each other just saying lets not think about it too much as it might of been a bit of a mistake.  I was a bit down about it. We didn't every really speak about it again. The next week or two however when I was out with different friends they encouraged me to send him a message, I did drunkenly, quite late at night. All it said was that I actually really liked him.  He never replied. Ever. That hurt. It was doubly difficult because we worked for the same company and I had to see him during the week. It was really difficult for me so I started to avoid him. That continued for a few months, until one night after a friends party I sort of apologised to him for cutting him out and being distant.  We still never really talked about what happened that night. Things kind of recovered I guess. We all still hung out together in a group of friends. We never really talked or hung out alone together but things got back to I guess friends but not that close.
Forward to me leaving the company for a new job and my leaving night. We are all out again, again alcohol and myself him and another friend end up at his flat. The other friend takes the couch and I guess I ask the guy I like if I could go with him to his room he says, almost begrudging like ""yes but it'll just be fun"". So we get in bed, Im happy because Im in bed with the guy I like, but he's pretty distant/cold he just lets me get him off and then rolls over. I try to be tender but he was just not interested. I get up to leave in the morning and he says a bit roughly ""remember Joe it was just fun"", I hugged him kissed his cheek and said ""I like you"".
I left and I was hurt. I think I still am. I felt ashamed and grubby about myself like I never have been before.  The thing is this was 2 years ago and I'm still hurting.  We've hung out a few times since, but each time I've said to myself I just need to be his friend. I try to be supportive, we've went to a few clubs and Ive encouraged him to speak to guys but I hurt badly when I see him make out with other guys and hear that he's taken them home.  We had a couple of good nights out since, were it was like we were close friends again, I wanted to talk to him again like the night he opened up, but whenever I try to make that happen I think he assumes that I just want to go back to his for sex.  I don't. I just want him.

I don't want to feel hurt about him anymore.  I end up getting really drunk and sad and do destructive / risky things like hookups with random guys which happened on Friday because I asked him about his trip this weekend and it seems like he's away to be with a guy he is seeing.

So I've rambled, if you've got this far thanks for reading.  I don't know how to change. I recognise that I am severely lonely these days, I'm obviously hung up on this guy. I know it would never work between us.

I want to meet someone and it not to be about sex. I want to have real feelings for someone. I want to be happy.

I'm scared that the next few years are going to be just as lonely and destructive as the last few have been.

Help.

See here: https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/2m6t1y/i_dont_want_to_get_back_together_with_my_ex_but_i/ 

In the end, I thankfully didn't get back together with him. Once he realised there wasn't a chance that we were going to get back together, he asked if he could still talk to me for support. I felt kind of bad about rejecting him so I obliged. As predicted, once he was done moving on (using me to do so), he went straight back to being an asshole. Helping him out probably wasn't the wisest choice but at that point, I had stopped demonizing him as much and just saw him as a guy with some issues that needed to be worked out. I had hoped he would take what he had learned from our failed relationship and become a better person, but well, it didn't end up happening to my knowledge. 

It's been about three, maybe four months since we last spoke. I don't have any intention of being friends  with him or anything. I still feel a bit strange though. Why is that?. Throughout the relationship, a lot of mean things were said, and, I feel like my self confidence has taken some pretty critical hits I'm still recovering from. Sometimes he doesn't enter my mind for days, sometimes I remember the good times and miss him a little bit, and then other times I want to push his face through a wall. I'm feeling a lot better now than I did before, I can think about other people just fine and function normally but I'm still not firing on all cylinders even after so long. I seem to go three steps forward and two step a lot; although I have noticed that when things are going well at work or school, I'm absolutely fine. 

Will things just get better with time or are there some issues that I still need to sort through? In any case, thanks so much for your advice these past few months. Hopefully, I'll need to come here less when the next guy comes around. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a continuation/update from my previous post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See here: &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/2m6t1y/i_dont_want_to_get_back_together_with_my_ex_but_i/""&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/2m6t1y/i_dont_want_to_get_back_together_with_my_ex_but_i/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, I thankfully didn&amp;#39;t get back together with him. Once he realised there wasn&amp;#39;t a chance that we were going to get back together, he asked if he could still talk to me for support. I felt kind of bad about rejecting him so I obliged. As predicted, once he was done moving on (using me to do so), he went straight back to being an asshole. Helping him out probably wasn&amp;#39;t the wisest choice but at that point, I had stopped demonizing him as much and just saw him as a guy with some issues that needed to be worked out. I had hoped he would take what he had learned from our failed relationship and become a better person, but well, it didn&amp;#39;t end up happening to my knowledge. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been about three, maybe four months since we last spoke. I don&amp;#39;t have any intention of being friends  with him or anything. I still feel a bit strange though. Why is that?. Throughout the relationship, a lot of mean things were said, and, I feel like my self confidence has taken some pretty critical hits I&amp;#39;m still recovering from. Sometimes he doesn&amp;#39;t enter my mind for days, sometimes I remember the good times and miss him a little bit, and then other times I want to push his face through a wall. I&amp;#39;m feeling a lot better now than I did before, I can think about other people just fine and function normally but I&amp;#39;m still not firing on all cylinders even after so long. I seem to go three steps forward and two step a lot; although I have noticed that when things are going well at work or school, I&amp;#39;m absolutely fine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will things just get better with time or are there some issues that I still need to sort through? In any case, thanks so much for your advice these past few months. Hopefully, I&amp;#39;ll need to come here less when the next guy comes around. &lt;/p&gt;

I'm a bi dude and I'm 18. Please read my long story

It started when I was 14. I grew up in a small isolated town, not that much of a blend of different culture and beliefs. Small towns have few minorities of different races, religions and gay or bi individuals and cant even compare to the openness and diversity of big cities. I knew that I was attracted to other dudes. Hooked up with this one guy. We did everything together like friends do and did other things lovers do like sex and dating.

 Soon after a year I realized he was way to feminine for me and wasn't my type. I like manly dudes. Also I was going though a sexual identity phase and was hating myself because of my gay side.  I decided that we should just be friends. He's sort of cool with that but doesn't stop the flirting.


 One day a couple years later I decide to get drunk with him and another friend. Its chill and we having fun playing video games. Other friend passes out and we go for a walk. On this walk he tells me he loves me. While i think he's a cool friend and we had our run together I just don't like him. He understands and we laugh and talk some more.


 We drink a lot more booze until we get back to the house. My stupid drunken intentions led me to let him fuck me. When i wake up in the morning I'm filled with regret and shame. I'm so shocked and depressed that I did that I cut all contact from him and tell him it feels like I've been raped by him ( awful thing to say i know ). he didn't rape me, I was to drunk and stupid so I wanted to fuck, he should've said no but he didn't. It wasn't completely his fault but I blamed him. I shouldn't have blamed him but I did. I couldn't accept the hatred of being a guy having sex with other guys. 


Anyways after blaming him for me hooking up again and saying how much I hate him and how I never want to speak again he decides to tell everyone. He tells all my friends and basically the whole highschool that we fucked. He told everyone how I was ""begging for it in the ass"". Everyone was surprised,disgusted and found it funny

My self esteem and reputation destroyed. I feel into a deep depression and still have it bothering me to this day 4 years later. Nothing makes you feel like less of a man than having everyone know you fucked another dude. This might not be such a big deal at all you might think but In very small towns where gossip spreads fast and everyone knows each other  it is.


Not all my friends know. My close friends don't yet and I'm worried of what will happen when they find out. I'm so angry at my exboyfriend for outing me. It's supposed to be my decision on when to come out. He told me thats what I get for rejecting him and he doesn't care if everyone knows ,knowing It would ruin my life, he knew it would ruin me.

 But seriously , who the FUCK tells everyone someone else's sexuality preference secret just because someone rejected them?! This all happened 2 years ago but recently people have began to bring it up again and its so fucking humiliating and degrading .


 I have a girlfriend at the moment and she knows I had a thing for that guy before and she doesn't care. I love her but everyone still knowing I fucked and was fucked by that evil fruity prick gives me anxiety and depression and feeling like shes dating a less masculine me. I feel like I ruined my life by ever getting involved in that. Like I'll never be a real man cause everyone knows I was fucked by a really gay guy. 

I wish i waited to date men till I was adult. Its in the past and I try to forget but it still haunts me and I never want my family or close friends to find out and I want to murder my ex-boyfriend for doing this to me. I wish i had a time machine. What do i do? I really need opinions  Please give advice. Thanks
EDIT: yeah I know I was an asshole but did I really deserve to be outed over something that could've been talked out. Seems like I got fucked over.

Edit: I had some internally homophobic problems before.
 I wasn't serious about him ""raping me"" either, i wasn't going to do anything but it was a very dumb thing to say. This has been such a big thing in my life and I want closure.

I was a fucking nervous wreck, I'm telling you. It was like...bordering panic attack.

I mentioned that I wanted to talk to them about my personal life. My mom sat up in excitement (poor mom, she probably thought I'd gotten a girlfriend...).

They were really accepting, especially my mom. My father asked me some questions and then went back to discussing the skiing world cup. (classic dad)

I bawled like a fucking baby, too, which is what you would expect after you lock in your emotions for so long...I had a really personal talk with my mom afterwards and it felt really relieving.

Around august 2014, I decided to download Grindr, I wanted to find love, but I always told myself I just wanted to have fun. You know, ""fun"". Well, I became a promiscuous kid instantly, I'm 17, and still was at the time, so the sex offers and invitations from guys to go out were numerous. I accepted a lot and actually lost my virginity to a man much older than me, I'd rather not tell his age. Another thing that happenned is, I accepted a guy's invitation to his place to have oral sex, and he took pictures of me with my permission, I saw the pictures and well, it's a little dark and blurry and my face is not visible but I have some characteristics that can't go unnoticed: I shave my head and all my clothes are either black or grey. And you can see a guy with a shaved scalp wearing a grey hoodie, giving head. I didn't think it would trascend but obviously I was very wrong.
Afterwards, in october, I started dating with a guy from Grindr and we were a couple for just a little less than two months. We had sex, the relationship was based off of sex, but I never thougth about it. I was ""in love"". During the time I was his boyfriend, I stopped using Grindr, but something ugly happenned, the guy that took pics of me somehow contacted my boyfriend and sent the pictures via e-Mail. I owned it and came clean with my boyfriend, I told him that I, indeed am the one in those pictures, and everything went ok after that. However, I broke up with him because I started noticing how immature he was. I broke up with him at around 10 am, by 3 pm I was already on Grindr again, this time I asked a guy I thought was cute if he wanted to ""spend some time with me"", with which I never meant having sex, maybe just an intense session of kisses, which did happen but ended up with me giving him head. He and I had about 5 dates in like, one month and a half and had oral sex only one more time. With this guy I went for the first time to a gay bar, and btw I didn't like it. Life happenned and he just stopped answering my messages, so I tought: ""FUCK IT"". And downloaded Tinder. 
I had heard that Tinder was much better than Grindr, and well, at least the people I found on Tinder weren't as rude and sex-driven as the people I met with Grindr. Much like with Grindr, I had several proposals and a lot of guys talked to me. With one of them I had already talked to on Grindr but I didn't like his attitude. However, just to see if he still liked me (to raise my ego a bit), I contacted him on Tinder, and this time things did happen. He invited me to his apartment and told me one of his friends would be there as well. We had a fucking threesome. 
A fucking threesome at age 17. I am grossed out by myself for that. I feel seriously worthless for being so promiscuous at my age.
Ok, so, I kept talking to him and several others even though I knew nothing else would happen. Eventually I bacame tired and grossed out by my attitude that I deleted Tinder and even closed my personal facebook account. 
I thought that, by deleting my profiles and telling myself to never use again those apps, my slutty past would remain locked away and I could go on with my life. But I was mistaken.
Time went on and like a week ago, in my german class, I started noticing that other guy liked me. I actually liked him back. We exchanged phone numbers and dated for the first time last tuesday, he took me out for dinner to an awesome japanese restaurant and exchanged some words, we were both nervous, and felt that special connection. Next day he told me he liked me, and I told him the same. My heart was fucking bursting out of my chest, after being so depressed I thought I was having a chance at love again. That day we went out to a café near our languages school after class and chatted a bit. He then drove me home and I kissed him in the cheek, that was as far as we went. Like one of those dates our grandparents had, or whatever. 
Next day, we were talking through whatsapp and he told me there was a situation he needed to discuss, and I knew what was going to happen. 
He told some of his friends about me and showed him some pictures of me, he told me some of his friends recognised me from Grindr/Tinder and that he didn't like that. I don't know who his friends are or what they told him, but it's all fucked up now. He now says that he just wants me as a friend because he can't be with a person who was as promiscuous as me, although he said it in gentler and subtler words. The thing is, that not so long ago he went to France and because of that he broke up with his ex-boyfriend, and when he came back, started dating again with his ex, who shortly after confessed he had HIV because he had sex with someone on Grindr or something. 
I know I gross him out and now I am severely depressed, not just because I really liked him and now he doesn't like me back, but because my reputation is not good and I feel like I don't deserve anyone, and I will never have a dude by my side because everyone knows I was a fucking piece of shit slut. 
I told him that even though I feel miserable and ashamed for my past I am now a better person and am beyond what happenned, and that I am going to try to make him see that, because I really like him. But he says nothing else can exist between us appart from frindship, which he says he really wants to have. 
 
I don't know what to do now, we're gonna go to the movies tomorrow ""as friends"" and we're gonna have to see each other everyday because of our german class. I don't wanna lose him but I don't know if it's ok if I keep trying to get to him and show him I am better now. I'm afraid that could drive him away from me. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok, I&amp;#39;ll start.
Around august 2014, I decided to download Grindr, I wanted to find love, but I always told myself I just wanted to have fun. You know, &amp;quot;fun&amp;quot;. Well, I became a promiscuous kid instantly, I&amp;#39;m 17, and still was at the time, so the sex offers and invitations from guys to go out were numerous. I accepted a lot and actually lost my virginity to a man much older than me, I&amp;#39;d rather not tell his age. Another thing that happenned is, I accepted a guy&amp;#39;s invitation to his place to have oral sex, and he took pictures of me with my permission, I saw the pictures and well, it&amp;#39;s a little dark and blurry and my face is not visible but I have some characteristics that can&amp;#39;t go unnoticed: I shave my head and all my clothes are either black or grey. And you can see a guy with a shaved scalp wearing a grey hoodie, giving head. I didn&amp;#39;t think it would trascend but obviously I was very wrong.
Afterwards, in october, I started dating with a guy from Grindr and we were a couple for just a little less than two months. We had sex, the relationship was based off of sex, but I never thougth about it. I was &amp;quot;in love&amp;quot;. During the time I was his boyfriend, I stopped using Grindr, but something ugly happenned, the guy that took pics of me somehow contacted my boyfriend and sent the pictures via e-Mail. I owned it and came clean with my boyfriend, I told him that I, indeed am the one in those pictures, and everything went ok after that. However, I broke up with him because I started noticing how immature he was. I broke up with him at around 10 am, by 3 pm I was already on Grindr again, this time I asked a guy I thought was cute if he wanted to &amp;quot;spend some time with me&amp;quot;, with which I never meant having sex, maybe just an intense session of kisses, which did happen but ended up with me giving him head. He and I had about 5 dates in like, one month and a half and had oral sex only one more time. With this guy I went for the first time to a gay bar, and btw I didn&amp;#39;t like it. Life happenned and he just stopped answering my messages, so I tought: &amp;quot;FUCK IT&amp;quot;. And downloaded Tinder. 
I had heard that Tinder was much better than Grindr, and well, at least the people I found on Tinder weren&amp;#39;t as rude and sex-driven as the people I met with Grindr. Much like with Grindr, I had several proposals and a lot of guys talked to me. With one of them I had already talked to on Grindr but I didn&amp;#39;t like his attitude. However, just to see if he still liked me (to raise my ego a bit), I contacted him on Tinder, and this time things did happen. He invited me to his apartment and told me one of his friends would be there as well. We had a fucking threesome. 
A fucking threesome at age 17. I am grossed out by myself for that. I feel seriously worthless for being so promiscuous at my age.
Ok, so, I kept talking to him and several others even though I knew nothing else would happen. Eventually I bacame tired and grossed out by my attitude that I deleted Tinder and even closed my personal facebook account. 
I thought that, by deleting my profiles and telling myself to never use again those apps, my slutty past would remain locked away and I could go on with my life. But I was mistaken.
Time went on and like a week ago, in my german class, I started noticing that other guy liked me. I actually liked him back. We exchanged phone numbers and dated for the first time last tuesday, he took me out for dinner to an awesome japanese restaurant and exchanged some words, we were both nervous, and felt that special connection. Next day he told me he liked me, and I told him the same. My heart was fucking bursting out of my chest, after being so depressed I thought I was having a chance at love again. That day we went out to a café near our languages school after class and chatted a bit. He then drove me home and I kissed him in the cheek, that was as far as we went. Like one of those dates our grandparents had, or whatever. 
Next day, we were talking through whatsapp and he told me there was a situation he needed to discuss, and I knew what was going to happen. 
He told some of his friends about me and showed him some pictures of me, he told me some of his friends recognised me from Grindr/Tinder and that he didn&amp;#39;t like that. I don&amp;#39;t know who his friends are or what they told him, but it&amp;#39;s all fucked up now. He now says that he just wants me as a friend because he can&amp;#39;t be with a person who was as promiscuous as me, although he said it in gentler and subtler words. The thing is, that not so long ago he went to France and because of that he broke up with his ex-boyfriend, and when he came back, started dating again with his ex, who shortly after confessed he had HIV because he had sex with someone on Grindr or something. 
I know I gross him out and now I am severely depressed, not just because I really liked him and now he doesn&amp;#39;t like me back, but because my reputation is not good and I feel like I don&amp;#39;t deserve anyone, and I will never have a dude by my side because everyone knows I was a fucking piece of shit slut. 
I told him that even though I feel miserable and ashamed for my past I am now a better person and am beyond what happenned, and that I am going to try to make him see that, because I really like him. But he says nothing else can exist between us appart from frindship, which he says he really wants to have. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know what to do now, we&amp;#39;re gonna go to the movies tomorrow &amp;quot;as friends&amp;quot; and we&amp;#39;re gonna have to see each other everyday because of our german class. I don&amp;#39;t wanna lose him but I don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s ok if I keep trying to get to him and show him I am better now. I&amp;#39;m afraid that could drive him away from me. &lt;/p&gt;

I have a problem that keeps nagging me and was wondering if any of you guys could shed light on it.

In the span of a month and a half I have turned 18 and have moved away from home to attend university. On the weekends (since that's the only time I can get away from school) I go down to Sydney. All this freedom at once, combined with coming to terms with my sexuality has resulted in some misadventures. 

To condense everything down:

I went to a sauna near oxford street a couple of hours ago (before this I had never kissed anyone as well as the furthest thing I had done with a guy was oral). I met a guy at the sauna (let's call  him ""A"") and one thing lead to another and I ended up having protected anal sex and bj. Afterwards I suggested that ""A"" and I swap numbers since we had a bit in common. ""A"" told me to wait in another room and he would be there after he got changed. I waited for about half an hour and then went looking for him. A guy, when I was calling A's name out  said he was busy with someone else. I don't know why but I got upset of because of that. I thought we had something together but I guess I didn't pick a good venue to start a relationship. 

Should I be having these feelings for someone who I lost my virginity to? Also, I gave unprotected oral so should I get tested? 

I have read that other bros have had ""slut"" phases. Would this one of them? 

Thanks Gaybros

First of all, I'm a bi guy who has almost no experience with dating/having sex with men (I do have experience with girls though). I've been single for quite some time now so I decided to try out a dating app. I'm fully closeted so that's the only way for me to meet someone to talk to/hook up. 

Ok, so, I've met a guy who's really fun to talk to; we share a few interests, but are also very different. After a few days of talking we decided to meet and the ""date"" went pretty well (very platonic though: only talking, not even a kiss or anything). 

The problem is that we clearly want different things: he's looking for a relationship, while I'm totally new in this and want to experiment a little first. I'm not - in any way - prepared to have a relationship with another guy: a) I'm closeted, which would be a huge obstacle in having a relationship, b) I can't even imagine myself in a relationship with another guy (yet) and c) I need some ""me"" time - I enjoy being single and would like to stay that way for at least some time. 

I told everything I've wrote in the previous paragraph to this other guy. He seemed a little crushed, we talked about it a bit, and I was 100% sure that he got the message: I don't want a relationship. However, we continued taking (with a bit of flirting included) and he asked me on a second date yesterday. I didn't want to hurt his feeling at that very moment (we had kind of a deep conversation) so I accepted. I regret that now; I think that, in his mindset, he now thinks that ""we'll figure things out while we go"", but there's nothing to figure out - I don't want a relationship. 

I'm planning to cancel the date tomorrow. That's the only option I see: he wants a relationship and I do not so it's better to call things off now that we're not that involved yet. He had quite a few boyfriends/sex partners who took advantage of him, but never agreed to take the relationship up to the next level. I, I'm afraid, am not ready for that either.

So, the question is: how do I let him down easy? I mean, I know that no break up is easy, but I want to be loud, clear and definitely not bitchy. He didn't seem to get what I was saying the first time (maybe I should mention that he's a very optimistic and kinda needy person) so it's even more complicated to repeat everything now ...

 It was absolutely clear that I could be gay when I had a reaction after almost kissing someone from my class, and that made me run to the bathroom. I think I was ten or so, the ten year old that was convulsing in the bathroom.

I felt shame. Contempt. I panicked. I didn't know how to cope. I know my heart beat was fast every day because I worried about what people thought of me. I hid within myself, but my shell was always on the edge, terrified.

So about 2 months ago I went to the doctor to get some hemorrhoids checked out which turned out to be anal fissures. The doctor prescribed me some special cream, told me to change my diet and NO MORE ANAL SEX.
So far I have been using the cream 2-4 times a day, I have jacked up the amount of water I drink A TON, I take about 4-6 Citrucel fiber pills a day, and I havent put anything up my butt for months (except sometimes just some mild touching, but that is it). So far I haven't noticed any great progress... I still bleed when I go the bathroom, it is still painful, and it still gets itchy and uncomfortable. I really want to get back to having a normal sex life and being able to poop without it feeling like a knife is coming out of my rear end. 
I have a check up next week and was thinking about bringing up the surgery option. My anal fissures have been a problem since about May of last year and Im starting to lose hope (sorry I dont mean to sound whiny and pathetic) .
What are your guys thoughts on surgery? Or treatment of anal fissures in general? What questions should I ask my doctor about the surgery?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys!

Backstory: I'm gay, my closest friends know it, but not many other people know. I've developed this crush on this guy, which I'll call Greg, which my closest friends also know. The thing is, Greg is obviously straight, since he has a long distance girlfriend in Alaska or some shit like that...

So last night, my friends and I, including Greg, got drunk and got moderately fucked up. My best friend, who I'll call Nicole, randomly says she needs to talk to Greg alone, so they go out of the room. Being as out of it as I was, I accepted that, but time passed and eventually I realized they were gone for a pretty long time, like for 20 minutes. So I go find them, we join the others, and everything seems normal. 

Later, Greg and I are going off alone to find water. Along the way, he randomly tells me about his divorced parents, his distant family, his abusive girlfriends, all really heavy stuff... And then he hints that something happened between him and Nicole. I push him further to say exactly what he is trying to say, and he reveals that he made out with Nicole. At the time, I took it in stride, and being the most sober one there, got both Greg and Nicole home safely, and then went to my room and cried.

The thing is, I know that this stupid crush can't go anywhere, and I know that it doesn't really matter and that I'll meet plenty of guys in college and forget all about Greg. But right now,... I don't know. I feel sad but I know I shouldn't be. I feel betrayed by Nicole but at the same time she's expressed remorse and I can't really be mad at her. I feel so dumb and I kind of resent the fact that I'm gay, even though I know thats stupid.

What do I do? Do I do anything at all? Have any of you guys faced this kind of situation? Am I blowing this whole thing out of proportion? I appreciate any kind of advice y'all can give me...
