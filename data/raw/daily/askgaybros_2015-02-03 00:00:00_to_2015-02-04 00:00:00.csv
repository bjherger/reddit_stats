- I got totally drunk and (I admit) a bit horny, checking out guys
- we got home (living together), I downloaded grindr and set status to ""right now"" and a kind of sexual headline :-/
- I noticed a picless profile 1m away
- I delete myself from grindr as soon as I woke up and was sober again
- next day my bf is all weird but does not want to say what's up
- this morning (2 days later) I see that he has a screenshot of my grindr profile

No throw away even though it seems like the cool thing to do. I'm a Canadian teaching English in Japan. I met an am currently in a relationship with a guy I want to spend the rest of my life with. I can speak Japanese well enough to be in a relationship with someone, and my boyfriend doesn't speak English past what little he learned in high school.


I love living in Japan, and I'm planning on spending another 3 or 4 years here. Eventually, when I move back to Canada, if my feelings are unchanged and as strong as they are now, I want him to come back with me. We've talked about it, and he seems really interested in living in Canada. Even when we haven't recently talked about it, he's always doing research online about things like how to transfer his job (care giver, soon to be registered nurse) to Canada, and it looks like if he can become fluent in English, he can come here and work. 


So, questions:

*1 Has anyone started a relationship in another country and come back together with their partner?

*2 Has anyone had a relationship with language barriers? Did you help that person learn your language?

*3 How to balance wanting to be with someone, but also wanting them to accomplish their dream? I want to be with him, but it would be so easier for him, career wise, to work in Japan.

*4 Is it hard/a long process to sponser someone/marry someone so that they can become a citizen in your country? Are there things I can do now in the meantime to prepare for something like that?

Thanks for taking the time to listen. Any person insights, stories, or even questions are all welcome!!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey all.

Background:

I'm 20 years old, very Christian (raised Southern Baptist), and have a slew of mental health issues I could write about for days... PTSD is the main one, which means I struggle a lot with (amongst other things) anxiety, depression, and dissociation. I pretty much never leave my home anymore, and I can't study outside of home due to anxiety and my issues with dissociating. I've just started seeing my fourth therapist to try and work through this stuff but nothing seems to work, ever. 

I've been labeled as having ego dystonic sexual orientation - which basically means I don't like the fact I'm gay. I'm out to my family, who reacted very badly... When I lived in the States I went through various attempts at reparative therapy, and my dad ended up leaving the family cuz he couldn't deal. 



I had been ""dating"" a guy online for two years, who I still love deeply... He broke up with me this past Christmas Eve and has made it very clear that he cannot make the emotional commitment required to be with me. We still talk multiple times a day and he says he wants to be the best friend he can be, but is not romantically available. He isn't seeing anyone else and says that isn't on his agenda at the moment, I don't know what I'll do when he does become interested in someone else... I still feel physically sick and on the verge of tears thinking about us not being together, I just don't know how to get over him :(

Which brings me to my really weird and kind of unrelated question... 

To put it bluntly, I've been seriously considering meeting up with someone to get the sex thing over and done with. I could scream at how much I want/crave intimacy of some kind, and I turn 21 in September and as yet have no experience with a guy past kissing. 

I guess my question is... Given my situation, how badly would it mess me up to meet up with someone to do this? I don't think my self esteem and self loathing could get any lower than they already are, and I feel like I have so much pent up sexual frustration that I could go insane(r).. I wonder if maybe it would help out my self image and maybe make me feel cared for, if only for a little while...?

Sorry for this being so long, I'm not sure if it all makes sense cuz I haven't read back over it so do ask me if something needs clarifying.

I want something to get off my chest. I'm 23 years old, ordinary, shy and deep in closet. I love wresting. Watching some hot guys wrestling and humiliating each other is my biggest turn on. I've been joining some online wrestling groups in a long time but never try it in real life. Last Friday a guy in wrestling group hitting on me, he was going to visit my city in the weekend, he asked me weather I got free time to meet him and do some wrestling. After he sent me his photo I'm a little bit overwhelmed because he's absolutely my type. Strong, hunk and masculine body with chest and facial hair. I really can't say no to this guy. I already know it would involve some sex scene after wrestling. I asked him: what will we do after the match? He said: we can jerk off together if you like, or just leave.


Then we decide to meet in hotel on Saturday night, when he opened the door. Wow, I can't believe what I'm seeing. He was better looking than the photo and I became nervous when I stepped in the room. We did a little bit chat, and then he said: hey mate, relax, why we don't get started from the bathroom. He started the take off his shirt. Again I was shocking to see such a hot guy in real life. My brain was getting empty and don't know what to. ""Come on we can take a bath together and be ready for the wrestle."" He said. Afterward we were naked in the bathroom and I noticed he already got a hard-on. ""haha, why standing there, don't you like me? Do something you like little boy."" I hugged him from the back, the following sense just like a gay sex bathroom sense. I kissed over his body and then on my knee to lick his dick. Suddenly he pulled me up and started to kiss me by mouth to mouth. Honestly I didn't expect that happened.


When we finished bathroom sense, we got on the bed and he started to show me some wrestling moves. He's 20 lbs heavier than me, actually he play me like a toy since he is very good at it also because that was my first time wrestling. A moment later I ran out of strength, we hugged together and started to have sex. Lots of sucking, licking, kissing, and jerking. This was the first time ever I had sex with a man, although there was no anal sex. That night we sleep together and next morning we had sex again, I told him to shoot in my mouth and I swallowed it. I felt I just like a slut, but I very enjoyed it.


After everything was finished, we went to a coffee shop for a lunch, he always checking with his phone and don't talk much. We just sitting there and keep silent. I felt awkward and uncomfortable about this. I asked him how many guys he had hooked up in the wrestling group. He said: pretty much, don't remember. It feels like last second we are lovers, next second we turn to strangers. After the lunch we just say goodbye and leave.


A moment later I texted him: 

Me: how do you feel about last night?

He: Pretty good, don't you think so?

Me: Yes, for me it's like a dream.

He: Lol, did you enjoy it then

Me: Yes, however I just realized the swallowing thing isn't safe and have a risk. Does anybody ever do swallowing for you?

He: Don't worry, you're the first one though, and I feel great.

Me: Don't you think we just doing something like one-night stand or casual sex?

He: Lol, you're taking it too seriously. Don't you have fun then?


Now I'm kind of emotional, I feel strange and can't stop thinking about him. Yesterday I chatted with other people in the group and found out he hooking up many guys all over the country. I was warned not to fall in love with him because he seeking some kind of adventure and unstable relationship. I feel I like an idiot because I do missing him. He is my first man and got a permanent mark in my brain. For me it just like having a dream and now everything is gone.

Using a throwaway for this one...

So there is a new guy at work and I think he is really cute: Dresses nicely, cute smile, nice hair and a genuinely nice personality. The whole package essentially. I was in the restroom at work the other day and I noticed a lot of strange sounds and motion coming from the stall next to me. I made the assumption that whoever is in there is whacking it furiously. I look down and recognize new guy's shoes so of course I listen for the grand finale before making my exit. 

Now out of coincidence (at first anyway), he and I are in the restroom at the same time and sure enough he is always going to town on himself and I always listen to him with anticipation. I've found myself actively waiting for him to go to the restroom and I follow a minute or so after. Does that make me some sort of sick person/stalker? I don't know how to proceed. Should I keep listening in or avoid the situation?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gaybros,&lt;/p&gt;

We we're driving back from the casino late at night and he asked to play some music on my phone. I gave him my password and he went searching for music. I'm driving so I wait for him to play some music, but no song gets picked. Instead he starts looking through my phone i.e my browser and Facebook. I tell him to stop and play some music. He doesn't. Long story short, I flip out and we argue. 

My position is I want to keep private things private. I don't feel comfortable having someone look at my texts, Internet history, or email. I honestly have nothing to hide on my phone except maybe the occasional porn site or gw subreddit. 

His position is that there should be nothing to hide in a relationship. Especially if we look into the long term, if we commit everything to each other and there isn't anything to hide, there should be no wall from each other. He also says he wouldn't care if I looked through his phone. 

So what do you guys think? Has anyone else dealt with this issue?

tl;dr : Would you let your serious boyfriend access to your entire phone? Or should private conversations stay private? 

I should point out that this has nothing to do with the issue of cheating. I never have and don't plan to cheat.

Since we first met, my partner has gained about 20 lbs of muscle, while I've gained the same in fat; his career is shooting through the roof, while I'm struggling at my job; and he seems to be flourishing socially while I'm becoming more and more withdrawn and depressed.  It's not that I'm a *bad* boyfriend, but the reality is that he could do a lot better than me.  We both know it, and we're both constantly reminded, because he always has at least 4-5 guys with active crushes on him. Often, I get the feeling he stays with me out of a feeling of obligation rather than satisfaction.

**Edit**:  Thanks bros.  I'm going to try working on my diet but I also realize I need to value myself more and not keep raising this issue with him.  I appreciate it.

A little background about myself. 
I am a college student in the USA and I've been completely out for about two years now. I'm like a lot of us on this sub where people would have absolutely no clue that I'm gay unless they're told. I don't go out of my way to tell people, because I try not to let being gay be one of my main defining attributes. With that, if someone asks me about it I always tell them I'm more than happy to talk to them about it and that no question is off limits. I'm out to all of my friends, my entire fraternity (a huge part of my life while in college) and my family - and I'm thankful that I've literally never had a bad encounter/experience about it - my people are so cool. Since I am so open to talking about it, a surprising number of guys my age will tell me if they think they aren't straight, ask questions, etc.

On with the story.
This weekend I was at a huge party with lots of friends, alcohol flowing everywhere, such college, very party. A guy from another fraternity on campus came outside to talk to me. I was with him at our pregame too, we know each other pretty well (see each other many, but not all weekends), but I wouldn't say he's my best friend. We have A LOT of mutual friends. When he came up to me he asked me if he could talk to me about something and of course I told him yes. I've helped him through a lot of girl problems so I thought that was what he wanted to talk about. He starts it off with the classic, ""how/when did you know that you're gay?"" My response is always the same and has become a reflex, ""how/when did you know that you like girls? For me there was no event of any kind, it just developed over time and finally one day I started to accept it and work toward being more and more comfortable with it and myself."" And he responds with, ""well I don't know if I only like girls."" He goes on to tell me that he has watched gay porn before and kinda liked it, that he has talked to other gay people about this too, and that he's wondering what to do next. (He also told me that his parents are splitting up and that there's a fight over custody of his younger brother - something I've dealt with too. This kinda goes into consideration when I think about wether it's appropriate for me or not.) We talk for a while, I explain the Kinsey scale, how nobody is completely one or the other (IMO), that there's a difference between being romantically attracted to a gender and sexually attracted to a gender, and I tell him more about my coming out experience. As we keep talking and talking I start to find myself becoming more and more interested in being with him. Having a little alcohol in me I also tell him that hey, it's college and its ok to experiment a little, to get out there and maybe he'll learn more about himself if he tries anything with a guy - not mentioning he should try those with me (I sure hope he was thinking it tho hahaha). I should also mention this party is so crowded people are shoving us into each other (yes!). We spend a lot of the evening hanging out and everything and eventually we had a chance to talk about it a little more, but then we were interrupted by some beef he had with another friend, they get in an argument, I go home. Later I text him about some unrelated stuff and he tells me that we'll chill over the weekend. I did see him at another point in the weekend, but only for an hour or so and we didn't talk about any of that stuff.

So, here's the deal. I thought maybe he was coming onto me, but we were both drunk. I have never gotten signs like that before, but maybe these weren't even signs - I guess I don't know. I don't have many options here, and this guy is perfect. I really, honestly do think we could be awesome for each other. I don't wanna ruin a friendship, and I would hate to make anything awkward for our other friends and I'll definitely see him again often and soon.

So I made a throwaway because a few friends know my actual username and I don't think I want them to know yet - or at all.

I posted like three weeks ago asking for your opinions on age gaps in relationships. I'm 19 and my boyfriend is 32; we've basically been seeing each other for almost 3 months and today I think he raped me.

He's been really compassionate and understanding, and the hooking up was always sensual and not really aggressive. I was at his house earlier today and we were talking and then started to hook up, and for the first time he was... rough. I thought it was fine at first but I told him it kind of hurt so could he please slow down or stop. He didn't. I don't think I've ever felt more pain than that he was literally drilling my ass. I kept asking him to please stop or slow down and then he slapped me really hard across the face and when I tried to push him away he over powered me and kept drilling. He took off the condom and then he came in my ass -which is worrying me the most - but at this point I really was just speechless I didn't want to say anything. He then told me to get the fuck out and I did.

I really don't know what to do right now. I live in Lebanon (middle east) where homosexuality is illegal and you could be jailed so I really can't go to the authorities with it. I don't even care about that I feel really... strange. And worried. There's so much going through my mind at the same time that I don't really have one thing to say. What would you guys suggest I do. Where do I start from here. And is it weird if I say that I'm actually kind of worried because he knows where I live and where I go to classes. He knows my parents' names and they don't know I'm gay so I'm worried if I try to do anything he could easily tell them I'm gay and that alone would fuck so many things up. I don't think I'm sad or mad right now. I think I just feel really empty.

I'm diagnosed with major depressive disorder and I'm having a down day. More or less, a down 3 months. I havnt had thoughts of suicide in a few weeks, but I want to kill myself again.

I only have two people in my life. My mom and the guy I'm dating. I have a really hard time trusting people, and I'm not even sure why I'm dating right now. Everybody that's been in my life has left it, and I eventually stopped trusting people and pushed everyone else out. So trying to let him in my life has been insanely difficult. Nearly called it off a few different times for no reason. I'm making myself keep him around and there's a war going on inside of my mind because of it.

I've had a very difficult/miserable past up until this point and I stopped seeing the point of living. I stop seeing it now. I started therapy and I'm on meds, but it kind of seems pointless.
I've had such a miserable life (19 currently) and nothing has ever gotten good or better for me. Im losing hope.
They say life gets better, but it hasn't happened yet.

I've known my entire life to be miserable. I don't know what to do to feel like there's hope. Will I ever be happy? Will life ever get easier? Isn't life supposed to get harder the older you get? Then what's the point in trying.

I don't know anymore.

Basically, he took my anal virginity, he convinced me to bottom and we had a decent session. He told me I did really well for my first time and couldn't believe it was my first time. He seems really nice. He is 18 and has already done this with a few guys which is crazy really for me to comprehend. He messaged me afterwards flying out the compliments and saying that he really really liked me and wants to hookup again and maybe see where things go and about how I'm so different to other guys he's been with. He is so mature for his age and we got on really well, but I still feel maybe he's rushing into it all... I know what it can be like at that age. 

The other thing is he wanted to come around again the next day after our first hookup and I had to decline as just bottomed first time in my 23 years and now he wanted to do it straight away again. Of course I was still recovering from the previous night which was kinda sore. He has such an enormous sex drive.

First issue of mine is that I don't know if I could accept a relationship this early, as I am not out to anyone even though I am bi and known it for a while. Secondly I don't know if the age gap is too much, for instance he is sexually more mature than me (crazy I know right?) but perhaps a lot less emotionally mature... Also he seems to be a TOTAL top, said oral was boring (I only like giving anyway so meh). In addition, I'm still getting to grips with bottoming and learning if it's something I want to continue. Not sure i'd be up for it like every other day.. at least not at the moment!

So yeah, that's it. Advice would be appreciated. And before you all ask, yes he is 18 for definite and he loves slightly older guys whilst I prefer guys younger than me (due to my inexperience most likely). He is a good guy, I can tell, and is so much more mature than he should be to be honest like he was so patient with me and everything.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So Sunday I had hooked-up with this guy in Grindr.

I've been with my boyfriend for about eight months and recently I  haven't been into having sex or even fooling around.

I think he's very handsome, so I don't think it has anything to do with not being attracted to him. 

It's making him feel rejected, unattractive, and embarrassed, which is making me feel more awful than I've ever felt. We're perfect in every other way, it's just this one thing causing problems, so I'd really like to fix this because I'm very much in love with him.

  Quick question for my bros out there about experimentation. My best friend and I are both in our 20s and identify as straight. We're super close and trust each other with anything. That said, we have both had more sexual contact with each other than we have with women. We've jerked each other off, and, more recently, started 69ing, and doing more overtly sexual stuff- making out, mounting each other and cumming on each others chest, timing ourselves to cum at the same time, etc. I guess my question is this- has our ""experimenting"" gone too far? What started as ""helping each other our"" has become a lot more serious in my opinion. Neither of us has even given a blowjob before, nor have we made out with another guy before recently. My other concern is that he went from saying that the thought of mouth stuff ""made him  throw up"" to 69ing with me. I guess I just want to make sure that this sexual aspect of our relationship doesnt affect the platonic portion that means much more to me.
    
   Lastly, and most importantly, I recently talked with a mutual friend of our about this, was feeling really vulnerable, and eventually said that me and this guy were blowing each other. I feel that I've completely violated his trust, but I really don't know how to address it. I know that the person I told won't ever bring it up, but it still really bothers me that I told a mutual friend of ours something so personal about him (even if this other guy is a huge confidant and mentor of mine). My best bud texted me the other night asking if I'd ever told anyone. I lied to him (which Ive never done before) and said that I hadnt, that this was between us, that Id never violate his trust. Every word felt like venom that i was injecting into our friendship and I feel awful, but I don't know if it's better just to live with that and not come clean about it to avoid all of the drama that would ensue and the loss of trust of the person that I respect and love most in the world. 

Anyways, as you can tell, Im pretty conflicted at the moment and any advice would be awesome. Thanks all!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all,
