Yesterday was my girl mate's birthday. I met there some great guys. Eventually I was going to sit somewhere and one of these guy came to me specifically. We started to talk about random things.

I found out we had many things in common: we were both geek, both 3d conceptual artists, loved the same video games, and we have been both unlucky in the relationship department the last two years.

Eventually he started to say he has always been curious about homosexuals because he has two gay friends in relationship and they're cute. Another person eventually came to us and we had to change subject. 

When it became late, I told him I was heading home and he asked without hesitation to walk with me. He brought up the ""curiousity"" subject again and began his speech like there shouldn't be any reason to not try, to feel ashamed, that it shouldn't be that bad, that he will never know before he tries. Told him I wouldn't mind trying him with him, I'm a perfectly fine and out of the closet homosexual. At first he was worried to hurt me, since he still identified himself as a straight guy, but after a bit of conversation he was reassured. We started to talk about video games and shitz... And he ended asking if we could go somewhere, like, my place.

Needless to say, once we got there, he took the bull by the horn. He kissed me everywhere, hugged me. He didn't touch my dick and didn't ask me to access it, which made him feel guilty, he felt like he was using me. But I reassured him, again, that it was fine and that anyway I don't like much people playing in that area anyway. He asked me to do anything I wanted. So I blew him and jerked him off for like two hours and he enjoyed every minute of it. He kept telling me how attractive I was, kissing me, and all.

Now the tricky part. He enjoyed it. He was the one to come to me first, to talk about curiosity, to ask to go to my place, he was the first one to kiss me (I was expecting mere cuddling at first since it's both what we miss most), he moaned of pleasure during all this time, asked for more.
**BUT**, he didn't stay the whole night. Once he came, he was all confused, he felt uncomfortable, suddenly unsure, full of hesitation and he hated himself for that because he said I was a great guy, he found me attractive, and felt like he was throwing away something good with potential. It's like if he implied there was no future and all, because he was suddenly unsure of who he was. I mean, I don't expect to marry him, but with so many common interests and a good mutual physical attraction like that, I'm surprised he's ready to close the door like that.

He said he had to find answers so he left. But before, I had a bit of a talk with him, trying to calm down, to reassure him. I don't want to force things on him, or to force him to do anything, I said my door was always open even for a quick talk. But I don't know how to deal with that properly. My main fear is that he stop himself from doing something he actually enjoy for irrational reasons and I would be very disappointed by it. Not necessarily because I want to have him, but I don't like people preventing themselves to enjoy something for no good reason.

We had an instant connection, we please each others' presence and personality, we have many things in common and we both miss cuddles. I don't understand why he would prevent himself from that and I don't know how to handle the situation correctly. I mean, he's questioning himself, but I don't want that introspection to crush this whole side of him.

**TL;DR**: Straight guy came to me during a party, telling me he was curious. He found out we had tons of things in common and a good chemistry. He asked to come to my place, telling me he was missing cuddling. Brought him to my place. He started to kiss me everywhere, asked me to ""do"" him. I blew him, made him come, he enjoyed every minute of it. Yet afterward he started to have second thoughts, hesitations, and I don't know how to handle that or make him feel more at ease about the idea of having homosexual sex.

So about a month ago I had unprotected receptive anal sex with a random guy that drugged me at a club. The past two days I've run a fever and have had intermittent headaches. I'm very worried it might be a seroconversion illness. 

I've been desperate to go get tested for HIV but having studied it in depth (as a biomedicine student) I know that any test available to me in Australia before 4 weeks isn't going to be all that conclusive anyways. I'm going to get tested on Monday but have found myself experiencing extreme anxiety (which is only compounding my fever and headaches) and there really isn't any time earlier I can get tested (which I would). 

I know all about safe sex, I know the relative risks of transmission, I know the prognosis and treatment options for HIV+ patients; I just can't get over the anxiety, stress and worry I'm experiencing. I can't sleep, can't eat anything, have been excersing compulsively to try to destress (which is not helping my fever) but nothing has worked. 

As a 20 year old who has only just recently come out, I feel that a positive diagnosis would just completely and utterly destroy my life. Not to mention I'd have to tell people how I got the disease. I'm ashamed and embarrassed that I allowed myself to be put into a situation where I could be forced to have sex. I'm embarrassed that I wasn't able to fight him off. I'm angry at myself for not seeking post-exposure prophylaxis as soon as I arrived home (I was abroad in the US at the time). I'm worried how I'm gonna tell my (recent) boyfriend if I do test positive. Im furious at the guy who drugged me (if I ever see him again I'll bash the living shit out of him, HIV+ or not). I'm worried that my regular friends will judge me as being slutty or stupid or unclean (we've all been educated properly about safe sex and the need for condom use). I don't know how I'd deal dating as an HIV+ man. Basically I'm worried that my life is now over because I decided one last night out in Vegas was a good idea. 

Right now, I need some strategies to deal with the anxiety I'm feeling and hearing some stories about other guys who've gone through similar experiences would be comfortin. I hear that HIV scares are common among gay men :/. 

Just realised that this is quite the long post :/ I put a tl;dr at the top but I appreciate everyone who took the time to read all the way through. I also wanted to point out that this post is in no way meant to shame or degrade those who are HIV+; hell it's possible that I'm HIV positive too.

**EDIT:** Thanks everyone for the advice and perspective. I'm still feeling quite anxious, but I'm gonna try meditation and distraction techniques to keep me occupied. In the meantime, I'm gonna capitalise on the fact that I'm actually somewhat tired for the first time in 2-3 days and attempt some sleep.

I need to vent, and I also want some of your opinions.  So here goes, a little background:
We have been dating for about 2 years, and have agreed on a monogamous relationship.
We live together (I own the condo, he pays me), have a joint financial account (credit card and bank account)
We have a puppy together
He quit his job and was going to start school full time in the fall

So long story short, I found out he cheated on me.  I read a few of his text messages (not my best moment, but I had my suspicions) and discovered that he had been sending inappropriate text messages to at least one person.  They included things along the line of “I can’t wait to taste your cock again” and “next time I’ll remember to bring the condoms”.

So when I confronted him about this, he told me that they were fantasies and only talked and never actually met.  I have my doubts about this considering the content of the text messages, but I really can’t be sure.  I trusted him completely and he definitely destroyed that trust.  I can’t bring myself to trust him that he never physically did anything.

I really need some advice on a path forward.  I am still processing everything, but I need some advice.  Is it worth trying to get back to where we were before, trust and relationship wise?

I'm sorry if you don't want to read a sad little rant about how shitty I'm feeling at the moment, you can turn back now - I don't really blame you. 

So. Where to begin. I'm having a shitty week. A shitty month, really. It's nothing new, I guess, but I'm feeling worse than usual. I always pass off these periods as phases that'll pass. As periodic low points that simply come and go... troughs to my sine graph. I usually get through them well enough, but today I just snapped. This week I got about quarter of the sleep I should have. One night I slept for 45 minutes, the next 3 hours, the next 4... the point is, I'm sleep deprived and just plain trashed. I have a persistent cough and headaches that come and go. My diet is complete shit, and if I eat more than one meal per day, chances are most it'll be fast food. I fucking hate myself for it. I know I should eat better. I know I should sleep more. But apparently those are too great deviations from my little graph. How can you fix one part of yourself when every other part needs attention too? I go to the gym, but since I don't eat enough I see no results. Today my arms were shaking so badly I had to deload even my small weight after one set, and I nearly fell over during a squat from lightheadedness. I had a minor breakdown in the bathroom after cardio, even before all this happened, and I couldn't even tell you why. I had to hyperventilate when I got back into my car.

I hate going through the motions like this - my _wonderful_ little sine graph. I hate my sleeping patterns. I hate my eating patterns. I hate putting in effort only to see no benefit. I hate seeing my ever-present acne in the mirror. I hate being a small, pale, average looking guy no one will look twice at.  I hate that I'm still up at 5AM typing this, because for some reason I still won't sleep. I hate that I can't find enjoyment in my games anymore, and I hate that I'll spend hours on reddit looking to the top right corner for validation because I can't find any in myself. I hate that I'm wasting a year of my life, wallowing in self-pity and misery, while I just lie down and submit to the very things I swore I'd fix. I hate having so few people to confide in, and having no significant other to ease the shittyness. I hate that I'm so inexperienced. I hate that I'm so phobic of anything approaching failure. I hate that I'm so negative about everyone and everything, I hate that after all this time and after I've come so far with myself I still have practically zero confidence... and I hate that I'm always my own worst enemy. And yet, I still do it all. Every single week, day in, day out. 

So, _bros_, riddle me this. How do you go about fixing any one of these problems individually, let alone altogether in the clusterfuck of  an existence they currently are?

_Sigh_. Fuck it. I really don't want to submit this, because I just keep thinking that I can get over it myself. I mean, I always bounce back in the end, right? There's no reason to let other people know. But I'm sick of this shitty atmosphere of repetition I've built for myself, and I'm sick of keeping mouth firmly shut so no one knows what's going on in my head. I'm sick of knowing all the answers and not doing a damn thing with them. I just... I want to change.


Help?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I promised myself I&amp;#39;d never be here, posting one of these topics in an emotional outburst... but here I am and that&amp;#39;s what this is. I&amp;#39;m sorry if you don&amp;#39;t want to read a sad little rant about how shitty I&amp;#39;m feeling at the moment, you can turn back now - I don&amp;#39;t really blame you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So. Where to begin. I&amp;#39;m having a shitty week. A shitty month, really. It&amp;#39;s nothing new, I guess, but I&amp;#39;m feeling worse than usual. I always pass off these periods as phases that&amp;#39;ll pass. As periodic low points that simply come and go... troughs to my sine graph. I usually get through them well enough, but today I just snapped. This week I got about quarter of the sleep I should have. One night I slept for 45 minutes, the next 3 hours, the next 4... the point is, I&amp;#39;m sleep deprived and just plain trashed. I have a persistent cough and headaches that come and go. My diet is complete shit, and if I eat more than one meal per day, chances are most it&amp;#39;ll be fast food. I fucking hate myself for it. I know I should eat better. I know I should sleep more. But apparently those are too great deviations from my little graph. How can you fix one part of yourself when every other part needs attention too? I go to the gym, but since I don&amp;#39;t eat enough I see no results. Today my arms were shaking so badly I had to deload even my small weight after one set, and I nearly fell over during a squat from lightheadedness. I had a minor breakdown in the bathroom after cardio, even before all this happened, and I couldn&amp;#39;t even tell you why. I had to hyperventilate when I got back into my car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate going through the motions like this - my &lt;em&gt;wonderful&lt;/em&gt; little sine graph. I hate my sleeping patterns. I hate my eating patterns. I hate putting in effort only to see no benefit. I hate seeing my ever-present acne in the mirror. I hate being a small, pale, average looking guy no one will look twice at.  I hate that I&amp;#39;m still up at 5AM typing this, because for some reason I still won&amp;#39;t sleep. I hate that I can&amp;#39;t find enjoyment in my games anymore, and I hate that I&amp;#39;ll spend hours on reddit looking to the top right corner for validation because I can&amp;#39;t find any in myself. I hate that I&amp;#39;m wasting a year of my life, wallowing in self-pity and misery, while I just lie down and submit to the very things I swore I&amp;#39;d fix. I hate having so few people to confide in, and having no significant other to ease the shittyness. I hate that I&amp;#39;m so inexperienced. I hate that I&amp;#39;m so phobic of anything approaching failure. I hate that I&amp;#39;m so negative about everyone and everything, I hate that after all this time and after I&amp;#39;ve come so far with myself I still have practically zero confidence... and I hate that I&amp;#39;m always my own worst enemy. And yet, I still do it all. Every single week, day in, day out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, &lt;em&gt;bros&lt;/em&gt;, riddle me this. How do you go about fixing any one of these problems individually, let alone altogether in the clusterfuck of  an existence they currently are?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sigh&lt;/em&gt;. Fuck it. I really don&amp;#39;t want to submit this, because I just keep thinking that I can get over it myself. I mean, I always bounce back in the end, right? There&amp;#39;s no reason to let other people know. But I&amp;#39;m sick of this shitty atmosphere of repetition I&amp;#39;ve built for myself, and I&amp;#39;m sick of keeping mouth firmly shut so no one knows what&amp;#39;s going on in my head.

I'll try to keep this fairly concise, but I want to make sure I describe my situation adequately.

I come from a very religious, conservative background in the Midwest. My family is all like this (with the exception of some relatives on my dad's side who are less religious and/or more liberal). My dad is a bit homophobic, but I don't think he would care too much about me being gay. I really don't have much of a relationship with him, though. My mom, on the other hand, is extremely homophobic. We like to watch a few TV shows together, and some of them (e.g. Doctor Who) will occasionally include gay characters. Even if they only make one comment about being gay, she'll turn to me with this look of disgust on her face that says ""How dare they include something like that?!"" I tend to just ignore her, or shrug, or whatever.

Now, some background on who I am. Being brought up in this religious atmosphere, I was into it wholeheartedly. I went to Lutheran and Baptist schools growing up (never public school before college), and I was heavily involved in a couple of Christian student organizations at my university for my first three years. My religion, faith, whatever you'd like to call it, was honestly the most important part of who I was for a long time. But I still had my ""dark"" side. I knew from a fairly young age (maybe like...10, 11) that I had a thing for men's underwear. For years I convinced myself it was just that and nothing more - I wasn't gay. But eventually my curiosity with underwear led to getting into gay porn and such. I was ashamed, tried to keep myself away from it, but I always came back to it despite the guilt.

So I began the painstakingly long journey to accept the fact that I was gay. It started by opening up to other Christian male friends about it (about four years ago). They encouraged me to resist it, and that's exactly what I wanted to do at the time since it felt wrong, because I had always been taught that it *was* wrong. I kept this up for about three years, giving into my desires every so often (read: fapping to gay porn) and then confessing it to these other guys (we were all open about sexual things and tried to help each other resist them, since we were all of the ""no sex before marriage"" mindset, even for the rest of them who were straight).

During this time, my parents accidentally stumbled upon a journal I had been keeping during my trip to Rome four years ago, which is when I first started coming to terms with my sexuality. I had written about the entire thing in there, and you can imagine the kind of phone call that took place afterward. My dad was quiet as always, but my mom was in tears. I assured them that I was fighting against my desires, which was the truth at the time. That didn't prevent a few awkward subsequent conversations, though. After a while it got to the point where we just didn't talk about it anymore, and things pretty much went back to normal.

Fast forward to the end of my spring 2013 semester. I meet a guy online. He's halfway across the world and likes to talk about naughty things. I was still clinging onto my religion, but I was in one of those times where I was watching more porn and feeling less guilty about it. I even had a one night stand with a guy which sucked and made me a little doubtful as to whether I was actually gay, but that's another story. Anyway, this guy online, let's call him AJ. To make a long story short, AJ helped me to accept myself for who I am, a straight-up-6-on-the-Kinsey-scale gay man. I basically abandoned my religion (unsure whether I could reconcile it with my sexuality - that's still something I need to figure out for myself) and fell head over heels for him. We eventually dated for a short time, but that is also another story.

I know that's a lot of information, but here's the crux of the matter. My mom is so incredibly important to me. She's very supportive - in fact, I'm living with her and the rest of my family this summer while I do an internship in my hometown, and she's probably going to put up a bit of a fight when I try to move out after I graduate college in December. We're very close. When I'm at home, I spend more time with my family (especially her) than with friends. She loves me a lot, I know that beyond the shadow of a doubt. But it will break her heart to know that I've accepted my sexuality. Thankfully she hasn't brought it up in a long time so I haven't had to lie directly to her very much, but she is still under the impression that I'm resisting these desires (or maybe she thinks that they've just gone away since we haven't talked about it in so long). I even leave the house for an hour and a half every Sunday morning and cruise around town under the pretense that I'm going to church on my own, just to keep up this false image of who I used to be.

What should I do, bros? I'm not worried about being kicked out. My mom is much more the type of person who would do everything she can to help me pray the gay away. I'm with my family for the summer, but come fall semester, I'll be back at my university which is two hours away (although I still visit home quite frequently, usually once or twice a month). In December, I'll graduate, and I have no solid plans for what will happen then. I'm already pretty certain that I'll wait until I'm on my own to even think about coming out to my family, but are there steps I could begin taking with them now? Anything that would give them a nudge in a more accepting, understanding direction for when it does happen? Any advice is appreciated.

**TL;DR** - I love my mom a lot, but she's homophobic. I used to be religious and suppressed my sexuality, but not anymore. She thinks I'm still the same. How can I come out to her without destroying our relationship?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey bros!
