so, I met this guy through Uni in the second half of 2012, and I got gay vibes from him right away. I said hello every time I saw him around the place for the next year and a bit, but he dropped out and didn't thnk i'd see him again.

then one day we matched on Tinder early this year, around jan. He said he didnt realise I was gay and we chatted briefly but he said his friends has been mucking around with his settings (im kinda suss about that though) and we left it at that.

Then in the second half of this year (6months later), we were in a class together at uni and got to know each other a bit better. We got lunch a few times and got along great and stuff, like I think he seemed interested in me, as in, would hang out withme a little bit after class rather than going stright home.

then about a month back, I messaged him about our final essay etc, and somehow we startd talkijg about movies, and I asked him to come see a movie we both wanted to see, (thinking he'd prob say it was too short notice) but he said yeh and we orgainsed to see it in about 2min.

the nthe next week we got some dinner at a pub and then saw a anothr movie, then the next friday just dinner and a drink out, and then last friday, dinner and drinks again and a walk around the town and visting an art gallery coz it was open at night (super corny, i know).

then when I dropped him off, he said I should call him whenever i wanna catch up etc.

he deffs know's im gay coz I mentioned it as part of a story. 

the problem I have is, I'm not sure how he feels about me.

He's pretty quiet and also shy, so Im worried he might gay, but just be into me as a mate. Or he's not comfortable.

I don't want to make a move and scare himor something, and I don;t know how to work it into conversation.

I like him as a friend, but I'd also like to start hanging out with him on a more personal level.

sorry again if i've caried on, but I just need some advice or if anyone else has a shared experience.

As a child, the family I grew up in was violently dysfunctional, and the following happened:

  - When my sister was in the 8th grade, my dad threw a fit of rage one night and carried all my sister's belongings to his car and threatened to evict her
  - That very night, during all this, I picked up a kitchen knife during that night and aimed it at my chest and looked at it for a while. I only remember feeling very numb. My dad eventually saw me doing this and knocked it out of my hand.
  - My dad would regularly violently fling borrowed library books and notebooks we did our homework in, in fits of rage
  - He would frequently physically punish us
  - He would *always* shout at my mom (pretty much every single day) and the arguments would get really bad. Not joking about daily.
  - My dad was racist, bigoted, backwards, and ignorant. He gave me many of his ideas. He was also not very smart and pretty irrational but thought he was very smart. Regretfully, I mirrored a lot of that. I don't even know how and I don't like it.
  - Growing up through high school, as I realized how much saner the world was, how much chiller people most people were, I would have seriously depressive or angry fits and arguments with my parents. The arguments were a proxy war; I was simply so angry to have to bear my circumstances alone and reorient everything in my life growing up from a backwards dysfunctional family (I say this but didn't understand this consciously; at the time I wasn't old enough to really understand the enormity of what I was going through) and my parents were confused and frustrated with their own worries. 
  - My dad called the police a few times on me during some of my fits because I acted so frustrated. I was a confused child, with nobody to really turn to. Everybody else's world seemed unreal. SATs? Doing well in school? Hanging out after school? I was trying to survive. Much of my childhood honestly felt like war. I was always trying to survive.
  - To survive interactions with my dad, I learned to tense every muscle in my body to not give away any hints of fear, crying, or fatigue. Sometimes, I would stand there for two hours while bearing my dad's angry rants. It's difficult not to move either foot for two hours but I eventually learned how to ever so slightly shift my weight over a period of 10 minutes to hide the transition between each foot. I would very carefully control my breathing for whatever amount of time I had to so I wouldn't show my fear. I know this sounds crazy. I'm just stating the facts so you can understand how hellish this was. Years later, I instinctively tense up my entire body whenever I'm sitting. 
  - My dad would always wear long sleeves and long pants. For almost all my childhood, I wouldn't wear t-shirts or short pants because I would feel shame and fear from my dad.

This happened for five years (8 - 12). 

It took another five years (13 - 16) to process the shock of a completely different world. I learned the world is actually a *lot* more chill, people are mostly nice and like whatever, and in being so backwards and paranoid about things, you end up just becoming the asshole. I was basically holed up in my apartment (aside from school) as a child, so I didn't even understand basic things like social interaction, ordering food at a restaurant. The idea that there were other places in the world was not something I could fully grasp, when 1000 square feet of apartment and your imagination was your life for so long.

By 17, I was severely depressed and very angry. With only a year or so left of high school, I felt cheated out of my childhood, and I felt so different from my peers in high school. Everybody seemed to be growing up into strong and smart able-bodied young adults, off to bigger and better things. They were funny, they cracked jokes. They were so chill about hanging out and meeting up and going to outings. I was just beginning to crawl out from under a rock.

University (18 - 21).

I've been taking it slow, but I've been still feeling so overwhelmed and stressed.

Something I really notice that's different between myself and others is that most people are ... really chill. In fact, most people are pretty bored. So they go out and find something to do and they have fun. I find most people are totally okay with exploring themselves (and in the context of being gay, their sexuality), and they have no shame in expressing themselves. Sounds fun.

Not me. 

The best way to explain it is that I feel like I'm *always* in survival mode.

I'm terrified. All the time. I'm anxious. All the time. I think I'm emotionally scarred. I'm also super serious because, well ... when you're truly scared and you don't know who to trust and nothing makes sense and you get mixed messages and you're just a gay teenager, you become really cautious.

When I look at people my age of my generation, I can't fully understand them. I feel distant and disconnected, and like something is severely lacking in me.

They seem so confident. They've experimented with fashion, hobbies, outdoor adventures, food. They've traveled. They have social circles. And most are actually pretty cool and mature. I like being around them, but I don't know if they like being around me. I try to show my best side and really mean it.

I've been fighting to survive so long ... shit, none of this makes any sense to me.

Things have calmed down a lot more now between my dad and I. He's mostly a harmless old man now. But he will never even acknowledge what he did - he will throw the largest fit like it was back in 2000 if you bring it up. He also denies he has any effect on me ""now"" (he avoids the past). 

This is why I'm still so bitter towards him. I feel like he's a well meaning guy, but he had a lot of issues and he shouldn't have been a parent. He's not fit to be one. It took me 10 years to fix all this shit myself, and all he has to say for it is ""The best children grow up well themselves."" ""I can't affect you anymore now that you live on your own."" Total ignorance and bullshit and I hate him for that.

Other side of the story

- Financially, they have been extremely extremely extremely supportive. As it would go in many Asian families, this is how they show their love.
     - They are paying for my undergraduate tuition
     - They have given me half of a car
- They are normal average people, well-meaning and loving, just with a shit ton of issues that really fucks with people growing up

---

Despite this, I don't feel much of a connection with them. They've slipped from batshit crazy to a sort of peaceful apathy. If they were to die, I think I would cry more for who they could have been than for who they were. They had that little memorable of an impact on my life (in terms of meaningful conversations, fun adventures, we literally had 0).

The stupidest thing would be to let this kind of a challenge go unconquered, but even at 21, I still feel so overwhelmed by these experiences. It still affects me. I'm still crazy nervous and batshit anxious. I still tense up. It's hard to change. I want to be able to grow and learn from this, but I'm still kind of in shock. I'm still learning how my peers live and what that's like and what that means. I'm still discovering what I want. Put the gay in there as well.

I feel like people grow up and mature because they're able to actually own their experiences - they don't fight them. But I've always got my guard up, so I instead strongly resist experiences out of a fear that they will become unbearable, so I disown the experience first. Hence I learn slowly or not at all.

Shower thought:

- I found out the reason why I never learned to play any sport correctly was because I was tense. People would always leave that part out because most people *are* fucking relaxed - that's the way most people live. I didn't even understand what it meant when people said ""Relax"". Being physically tense was just so normal because I always had my guard up. I would always sink in the pool.

The fact that the term 'homosexuality' didn't even really exist until the 19th century for one. And that modern 'gay culture' movement is largely a Western, urban one.

There are plenty examples of homosexual acts and relations in the past and other cultures, but they usually occurred alongside marriage to a woman, or only happened with young males before marriage age.

If the idea of 'sexual orientation' and the identities that go with it is largely a modern, Western trend, just how 'real' is it?

I've always felt solely attracted to men- I certainly wouldn't blame 'societal environment' on that, I had no exposure to 'gay influences' as a kid- and yet it seems if I'd been born in a different time or a different place, I probably would have ended up in a relationship with a woman, at least for the sake of procreation or 'religious/societal duty'. Would I still have had prominently homosexual desires even then?

Its weird to think about something that's been so central to my concept of self being 'just another part of the culture I was raised in'. What does that mean for the whole 'born this way' argument, one I've always believed in? 

I hope this doesn't confuse anybody or get misunderstood, I'm just trying to understand where the modern gay identity fits in the larger scale of human history and society.

I started college three months ago and it was going great. Until two months ago I was hanging with my classmates most of the time and then I met someone on Tinder.(Let's call him ""K"") We are at the same college and he is two years older then me. He is absolutely the funniest person I have ever met. Not only him, also his friends are great people. He introduced me to them and we all started hanging together. I was having great time with him and his friends. 

Last month K told me he likes me. I already knew that but I didn't talk about that because I don't like him as he likes me. After he told me that I told him ""None of my relationships started like this. I've never said ""Oh you like me, I like you. Let's start a relationship."" All of my relationships (3 in total) started as friendship and grown from there.""
I told this to him to brazen it out because K is a little fragile and I don't want to hurt him. 

So we moved on like nothing is changed. We were together at every weekend. We went out, ate, danced for hours, slept together every weekend.(I was just laying but after couple of hours sleeping he always started to hug me and I didn't do anything about it.) Until today we were fine.(He always tries to touch/hug me. After a while I told him not to touch me so much because it makes me uncomfortable. This is only thing that not-fine, until today.) Today we were walking arm-in-arm. Here is the conversation:

K: I don't want to bother you but what are we ?

Me: Why do you have to name it ?

K: Because uncertainty makes me uncomfortable.

Me: You treat me like you want and that doesn't bother me. Our relationship does not really need a tag.

K: Its being nameless makes me sad.

Me: Well, the only thing that I am sure of that you are not my boyfriend and I'm not yours.

K: (Laughingly) We shouldn't meet so often.

Me: What, why ? I am really having great time with you. Why do punish me just because I am being honest with you ?

K: I though we have something special. (He was really sad while saying this.)

Me: We must just continue like friends.

K: (No answer)


We drank a little beer and took leave. To be honest bros, he is not my type. I am masculine and I want my boyfriend to be masculine. I love bearded, hairy men like me. He is hairless, beardless and feminine. I love his personality so much but with zero physical attraction it's impossible to start a relationship.

And two hours ago he texted me and said we should cancel our movie-night because he has work to do. I said it's okay but he is clearly attitudinizing. I don't want to finish my relationship with him.

And one more thing... If I lose him, I lose the people he introduced me. I love them so much. I certainly don't want this happen. After meeting him and his friends, my ""old"" life looked so boring. I don't want my old life back.

What should I do bros ? I need advice.

","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi bros !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started college three months ago and it was going great. Until two months ago I was hanging with my classmates most of the time and then I met someone on Tinder.(Let&amp;#39;s call him &amp;quot;K&amp;quot;) We are at the same college and he is two years older then me. He is absolutely the funniest person I have ever met. Not only him, also his friends are great people. He introduced me to them and we all started hanging together. I was having great time with him and his friends. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month K told me he likes me. I already knew that but I didn&amp;#39;t talk about that because I don&amp;#39;t like him as he likes me. After he told me that I told him &amp;quot;None of my relationships started like this. I&amp;#39;ve never said &amp;quot;Oh you like me, I like you. Let&amp;#39;s start a relationship.&amp;quot; All of my relationships (3 in total) started as friendship and grown from there.&amp;quot;
I told this to him to brazen it out because K is a little fragile and I don&amp;#39;t want to hurt him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we moved on like nothing is changed. We were together at every weekend. We went out, ate, danced for hours, slept together every weekend.(I was just laying but after couple of hours sleeping he always started to hug me and I didn&amp;#39;t do anything about it.) Until today we were fine.(He always tries to touch/hug me. After a while I told him not to touch me so much because it makes me uncomfortable. This is only thing that not-fine, until today.) Today we were walking arm-in-arm. Here is the conversation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;K: I don&amp;#39;t want to bother you but what are we ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Why do you have to name it ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;K: Because uncertainty makes me uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: You treat me like you want and that doesn&amp;#39;t bother me. Our relationship does not really need a tag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;K: Its being nameless makes me sad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Well, the only thing that I am sure of that you are not my boyfriend and I&amp;#39;m not yours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;K: (Laughingly) We shouldn&amp;#39;t meet so often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: What, why ? I am really having great time with you. Why do punish me just because I am being honest with you ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;K: I though we have something special. (He was really sad while saying this.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: We must just continue like friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;K: (No answer)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We drank a little beer and took leave. To be honest bros, he is not my type. I am masculine and I want my boyfriend to be masculine. I love bearded, hairy men like me. He is hairless, beardless and feminine. I love his personality so much but with zero physical attraction it&amp;#39;s impossible to start a relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And two hours ago he texted me and said we should cancel our movie-night because he has work to do. I said it&amp;#39;s okay but he is clearly attitudinizing. I don&amp;#39;t want to finish my relationship with him.&lt;/p&gt;

My wife has always known that I have a sexual interest in men which I have barely explored. I sucked a friends cock in college and it was amazing. Years later, just looking at him would send my heart racing. I have gone to a few anonymous group JO parties with her permission and those have been fun too.

She's even chatted up prospective tops in bars to try and find one for me, but I didn't find those interesting. I fuck my ass with a very nice dildo 3 or more times a week (relieves chronic pelvic pain) and love how it feels on my prostate. Now, when I get horny, my butthole tingles as well as my cock head. My childhood lust for the real thing is back with a vengeance. 

I would love to find a patient top who would be into mutual JO and mutual suck. I'd like him to take his time. Ideally, it would be something we could do periodically.  I really love my wife, but her sex drive has dropped to zero and mine is flying. We are good together. I could use more attention and male attention might be just the ticket. 

So, could I find a suitable patient top for an ongoing NSA play partner? (Maybe a guy in a similar situation?) How would I go about it? Should I have my wife be part of the selection process? Any of you have experience with anything like this? My cock is a healthy 8"" and somewhat thick. Would that make guys reluctant to top me?

So my ex and I went our separate ways about a month or so ago. And I still have really strong feelings for him.

The sick thing is that the two of them aren't even in a serious relationship or anything like that. They're just going on dates. My ex even said the guy was kinda a jerk sometimes. Certainly no soul mate. He even said they were taking things really slow so I'm sure they haven't even like had sex yet. And yet I'm beside myself, I feel destroyed inside because of this.

As the title says I'm new to the scene, been with girls before and now I'm sure I'm bi even when I don't have enough experience with guys. 

In order for you to understand my situation, I'd like to state that I'm a closeted bi guy( just to avoid any kind of confusion and so that you can understand the whole story)

Anyway, everything started a few days ago  when I met a guy on Grindr. He kept chatting with me whenever he was free and everything seemed to be pretty cool; we both agreeded we weren't looking for casual sex and that it'd be nice to get to know each other before something could happen.

 After a few days, we decided to eat out, just so we could finally meet each other, but after a few hours we ended up at my place and after a long long conversation we made out ( he made the first move, but we had no sex). A few minutes later, he left( however when he was leaving,  we had a real deep kiss that almost lead to sex).

The next day, we hanged out at night and after a party we ended up at my place once again, however this time once we got there, he started to kiss me passionally( yeah, he made the first move again)... and that's how we finally had sex. The following morning, we cuddled, had sex again and sleept together for a while . After that he left my place because he had to go to gym, and buy some stuff.

Nothing seemed to be out of the ordinary at the time because after he left I even messaged him and he answered me back pretty quick. Nevertheless, after that I wrote something back to him and he still hasn't said anything ( messages are shown with grey double checks  and it's been almost a day). This is what I can't understand... Do you think he was only looking for sex? or am I being too clingy? ( Yeah, I kinda feel disappointed because that is a sign to me that he might have lost interest in me).

My boyfriend is a 99/1 top. He says he feels awkward when he's bottoming, that he feels vulnerable and he just can't stop thinking ""theres a dick in my ass."" I'm a 60/40 bottom, I like to bottom but I've missed topping since we've started dating. He said he would work on it and try to get ""out of his head"" but we have other issues in our relationship right now so this really isn't the best time for another serious discussion. 

When we do have sex, he can last for over an hour sometimes. It usually ends with him eating me out and finishing himself, which i'm okay with because it kind of turns me on. He also doesn't like oral sex, says the same thing about ""theres a dick in my mouth.""

I'm not sure if he's fully accepted his sexuality. He's recently came out to his parents a few months ago, and even after having past gay relationships, I feel like he always needs to prove his dominance and masculinity. He gets annoyed around feminine guys and says that he just doesn't see why being gay has to define someone's personality. I'm a pretty dominate person myself, and I hate to think that he doesn't look at me masculinely. (We're both pretty outwardly masculine as well)

I just wanted to get some fellow gaybros advice or insight. Our relationship has been on the rocks as of late so I may just be overthinking and analyzing everything or maybe I just needed to get this off my chest.
