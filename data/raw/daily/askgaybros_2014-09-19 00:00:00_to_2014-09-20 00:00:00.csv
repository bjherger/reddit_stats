Part of the reason I'm posting right now is for something to keep me busy at the moment.  I don't really know what I want to achieve by posting this here, I think maybe this is a good outlet where I won't be judged (too much, at least) in comparison to my real life where I feel quite reserved. 

I don't really know where to begin - I'm an incredibly anxious person, and it certainly goes with my personality, but I wish it didn't affect everything else about me so much. The littlest thing can push me over the edge, and I hate that I struggle to do such basic and menial tasks. 

Along with this, I'm in a bit of a depressive spell at the moment. I don't really feel like my life is moving - everything is a routine and there's no plausible escape from it. I'm not in a bad situation, and I'm certainly thankful to be part of a loving family in a good environment but I still can't help myself from feeling like this, and I hate that. I hate that I do this to people, and I hate the ways I inconvenience people. 

I think what's also adding to this at the moment, is being gay and closeted. I don't have anyone to bounce my feelings off of, and I certainly don't feel like I'm completely myself around anyone. 

I over-think everything and while in some situations it's a benefit, it certainly causes me a great deal of stress. I don't feel like I can ever be content with a decision or a situation. My mind is always playing the what if. 

I think what's getting to me at the moment particularly is being gay and closeted. As I mentioned in a previous post, I'm certainly not in a situation where I can't come out, but I just can't bring myself to do it. I feel like a huge chunk of me is kept private and I'm not ever fully being myself. I feel like I'm waiting for the day where everything will be okay and I can be myself, even though I know it's completely unrealistic and that *I* need to put in the effort to make it that way. I can't just expect everything to fall into place, but I'm struggling to get there myself.

*sigh*, I'm really sorry for posting this and I hope I don't sound too whiny. I more just wanted to get my feelings out into text and maybe, if anyone else has experienced this, get their input. Anxiety and mental illness is general is so misunderstood to those who have no experience with it, maybe someone will read this that's experienced this and can offer advice (you certainly don't have to though) or even if they're going through it, just to know that they're not alone. Sorry again. I'll try to keep the posting to a minimum.

I have hair pretty much everywhere (some of it is starting to grow on my back even), and I've been extremely self conscious about it. I went through a phase from when I was 12-19years where I didn't wear any shorts and refused to let anyone see me shirtless. I have recently learned to get over my anxiety, and just learn to live with it. I am now a what you call an ""otter"", pretty skinny and really hairy. 

Over the past few years, I started developing this insane attraction to hairy guys, and I now almost exclusively watch hairy porn, and most of the guys I hook up with are pretty hairy. 

I recently decided to stop excessively trimming, and I now only trim my pubes more or less. It feels really liberating, and it really helps with me accepting myself for who I am, but I've had some negative attention from dating sites, and a very reduced amount of replies since I uploaded pics of my newly hairy body. 

So the main question is, what do you guys think about body hair? Would you hookup with a guy who is letting it all grow out? I feel like there are very few guys like me who are seriously into having super hairy partners, so I'd like an outside perspective. 

I'd post pics for your review, but I'm not sure if I'm allowed to do that on this subreddit.

I just started dating a guy, and based on our conversations, interests, goals, and chemistry, I don't think we're gonna stop talking anytime soon. I'm a pretty old-fashioned guy, like I open doors for him, pull up his chair, all that mushy sweet stuff.

Chocolates (or other sweets) would have been a good second option, but we're both trying to lose weight, so that's out. Now that I don't have those options, what should I give him that I can give on every date?

Using one of my old throwaways for this because my friends know my real username. 

I'm not sure if any topics here are off limits or what. I'm new to this sub and this will be my first time talking about it to anyone so so I apologize if I'm in the wrong sub.

Through my life,  I've only ever dated and had sex with women. Which I've thoroughly enjoyed. When I was younger, I never thought about being with a guy. But recently, as in the past few years, I've slowly been becoming interested in other things. 

It started with porn. I can't remember when it exactly started, but I soon found myself being turned on by watching gay porn. Then, I started having fantasies about some of my guy friends, and caught myself checking out other guys and imagining myself with them sexually.

Now, I've never been with a guy. And I never mustered up the courage to try it, because I was always afraid of what my friends and family might think. Right now, I'm in a relationship with a girl who I love and I'm a faithful person and our sex life is wonderful. But I still find myself wanting to have a sexual experience with a male. I finally have the courage to try, but like I said, I'm a faithful person who would never cheat. But I just want to try to find out what it's like and if I'll enjoy it. 

I think i would. I find myself having fantasies of myself and several other men. I don't know if I'll ever get to try and see if what I've been feeling is true.

For all intents and purposes I'm a baby gay. I came out when I was 22, but was in a string of very long-term relationships and haven't been single for much of the time since then. I'm 27 now, and just learning about dating, flirting, the ""gay stare"", etc.

Additionally, I recently got ""hot"", or ""hotter"" at least. I've been very dedicated in the gym, cleaned up my diet, improved my clothing/hair situation, etc. When I go out now, I definitely turn heads. I used to be pretty oblivious to this, but I'm noticing it a lot now. This is all totally new to me. 

The point of my mentioning this isn't to toot my own horn, it's just to stress that I've gone through a great deal of transition recently (for the positive), and I'm also new to the social conventions of dating.

So the issue I'm having is this: a lot of guys I end up going on dates with, or even just hooking up with, have this tendency to hurl this hyperbole at me that I'm not quite sure how to process. They say things like I'm ""perfect"", or the ""hottest guy"", or ""you're boyfriend material"", right out the gate. 

While I'm of course appreciative of compliments, sometimes I feel like there's something else going on when guys use extreme statements like these really quickly. I guess my question is this: are statements like these normal in dating, or is it a signal that maybe I should be setting my bar higher? My natural reaction when guys start using this language with me is to feel less attracted to them, and I don't know why that is. I used to be super insecure, not super in shape, and just generally without a lot of self confidence, so maybe it's the old me inside that's attracting these guys.

So we eventually exchanged numbers and the next day he wanted to met me. I was a bit reluctant so we met a books a million.

So a little bit about me, I'm 22 and have recently graduated from university. In terms of boys, in the past I've done alright. Did the whole casual university thing and from that a couple of more long term  dalliances have developed. However, I've never had a boyfriend, and haven't even been officially exclusive. 

During these 'long term' spells with guys, if I develop feelings for them, I find myself getting very emotionally insecure. Partly (I think) due to the fact that I've never managed to seal the deal and instigate something serious. 

Recently I've met a guy and things are going really well. We've been seeing each other for just over a month and it just feels easy. Until now I've not had that same insecurity, he just makes me happy. I believe the lack of insecurity was probably due to a feeling of inevitability, to me it just seemed like a relationship was going to develop. 

However, about a week ago we discussed where we thought things were going and that we wanted exclusivity. Something I've neglected to mention is that in February I'm going travelling for approximately 9 months. He knew I was travelling, but through a miscommunication was unaware how long for. Because of this, he thought it best not to make it 'official' but to carry on as we are and see where we both are when I return. 

Realistically this is the best and most practical outcome I could have hoped for, as honestly I don't think either of us are particularly fond of 9 months of celibacy, especially after only a month together. Despite this, after the conversation all the insecurities from my previous flings have come rushing back. I've seen him since our conversation and nothing has altered in the way we are together or the way he treats me. Yet I can't escape the nagging insecurity. 'why hasn't he text', 'does he actually want to see me or is he too kind to refuse?'

I know it sounds stupid, and when I type this it seems glaringly obvious that I'm being ridiculous, but somehow the little seeds of doubt worm their way back. I would really appreciate any advice as this insecurity is not healthy, and the last thing I want to do is to drive him away. 

Thanks in advance.

TL;DR - Sensible relationship decision to avoid excess commitment before extended separation has brought back past insecurities. Please send help.

&lt;p&gt;So a little bit about me, I&amp;#39;m 22 and have recently graduated from university. In terms of boys, in the past I&amp;#39;ve done alright. Did the whole casual university thing and from that a couple of more long term  dalliances have developed. However, I&amp;#39;ve never had a boyfriend, and haven&amp;#39;t even been officially exclusive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During these &amp;#39;long term&amp;#39; spells with guys, if I develop feelings for them, I find myself getting very emotionally insecure. Partly (I think) due to the fact that I&amp;#39;ve never managed to seal the deal and instigate something serious. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I&amp;#39;ve met a guy and things are going really well. We&amp;#39;ve been seeing each other for just over a month and it just feels easy. Until now I&amp;#39;ve not had that same insecurity, he just makes me happy. I believe the lack of insecurity was probably due to a feeling of inevitability, to me it just seemed like a relationship was going to develop. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, about a week ago we discussed where we thought things were going and that we wanted exclusivity. Something I&amp;#39;ve neglected to mention is that in February I&amp;#39;m going travelling for approximately 9 months. He knew I was travelling, but through a miscommunication was unaware how long for. Because of this, he thought it best not to make it &amp;#39;official&amp;#39; but to carry on as we are and see where we both are when I return. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realistically this is the best and most practical outcome I could have hoped for, as honestly I don&amp;#39;t think either of us are particularly fond of 9 months of celibacy, especially after only a month together. Despite this, after the conversation all the insecurities from my previous flings have come rushing back. I&amp;#39;ve seen him since our conversation and nothing has altered in the way we are together or the way he treats me. Yet I can&amp;#39;t escape the nagging insecurity. &amp;#39;why hasn&amp;#39;t he text&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;does he actually want to see me or is he too kind to refuse?&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know it sounds stupid, and when I type this it seems glaringly obvious that I&amp;#39;m being ridiculous, but somehow the little seeds of doubt worm their way back. I would really appreciate any advice as this insecurity is not healthy, and the last thing I want to do is to drive him away. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

First post here.  
  
So, I want to put out a disclaimer I feel is necessary. I've liked many guys in the past who are simply a bit overweight and I definitely don't need muscles even though, yeah, they're pretty. Anyway, I'm often lonely being single and sexless. At 21, I've never had a relationship and I don't hookup much. Since I've been 18, I've had eight encounters, five of which were with the same guy and only four of those encounters being anal.  
  
Anyway, my friend tried to set me up with someone from her hometown. He's a bit older than me, which I like, but when we met in person he was much, much heavier in person. He is about 5'4"" and close to 300 lbs. Now, like I said, overweight can be super sexy and I like some padding, but this man is very obese and, I'm sorry, but I'm not attracted to him.  
  
I told my friend I wasn't interested after meeting him for lunch and immediately she gets accusatory and shouts out in public (which was humiliating and people looked at me like some kind of monster) ""you don't like him because he's a bit overweight, right?! That's so shallow!"" and I was like ""actually, kind of.""  
  
Other than the lack of physical attraction, his obesity signifies some other foreseeable issues. I've tried to truly change my life for the better and have gone through plenty of lifestyle modifications that have led me to lose a lot of weight, become healthier, and fitter (although bursitis prevents me from working out ATM). I have a feeling he isn't about that lifestyle. I also enjoy being active now. I like walking for miles and miles on day trips to cities and living with two obese parents, I know that it's not gonna happen with an obese partner as they can't do much with me, which saddens me enough as it is.  
  
I know I may just be justifying my actions to make me not look as shallow, but physical attraction is important in a relationship. Now, I'm not the hottest thing. I'm like a 6.5/10 and maybe a 7 on a good day and I'm not very picky in terms of height, race, dick size, muscles, but what I think is close to morbid obesity is a whole other level. Or am I just a shallow prick? I would never be rude to someone who is obese, but I wonder if I'm a bad person.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello, all.
