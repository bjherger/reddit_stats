but heres the kicker, due to a terrible lack of confidence / self esteem, i have never had a relationship with a girl either, nor do i see myself having one (confidence issues again)

you see i always thought that my lack of ""luck"" with the opposite sex was due to my low self esteem, i mean i still do find some girls attractive, but not when i do, i don't turn to my friends and say so, it seems to me that when most guys see a girl they just turn to their friends and say "" wow look at the ******* on that "" 

i dont think i ever had that type of reaction, it just seems to me that such behavior is just crappy, then again maybe thats just my personality 

but in questioning my sexuality i remembered times where i noticed other guys 
sometimes it was some random actor on tv or some place else (i guess one of the examples that stand out the most, was when i was a kid in school, and i saw this other kid in class, and when i saw him i just went...i dunno it was like i skipped a breath )

sure i do fantasize about other guys, but thats not reality 

if it where reality, i'm not sure if i could or would do anything 

maybe its just my lack of self esteem again (theres a whole other story behind that, and its not a nice one, but i'm getting help for it )

but i guess here is my question 
could i just be gay and not have the confidence to be comfortable with it ?

Can you help me learn something from this I feel like its the Twilight Zone. Background: First Matched with this Therapist PHD Student on OKCuid, He did the same behavior blocking me (read below chat). Today we math on Jack'd and the chat as follows. The same exact things happens. What does this mean? Open to learning from the situation, its just so confusing to me, and believe me there is a bunch of this online (land of weird, freaks, and counter fits) . He is 29 and Just got his MFT, contacts me a year after original block, and I give him the benefit of the doubt. Hes cute in a otterish, bearded but skinny gym guy way. Before he said he had been cat fished in the past before a date so the therapist seems to need some therapy. Remember both times he matched and contacted me. Thoughts?


&lt;Mutual Match Notification&gt; 

Him: Hi

Me: Hows it going you remember me right. How's grad school program, what's new?

Him: Fine

Me: We should go on a hike sometime

Him: Sunday?

Him: Can you send some new pics

Me: I don't go around taking selfies.
My pics are close enough never had a problem as I recall you blocked me for being a supposed ""catfish"" before even meeting me. Let me know about hike date.

Him: Wow well then take one Umm that's weird See it's Easy

Him: MMS Received

Me: I have 6 pics on my profile you just matched with me? Remember you blocked me, I'm not a supermodel... maybe there is another profile like that ?

Him: They are the same lol

Me: Ok? 6 different recent pics in different places are the same?

Him: So because ur not a supermodel you won't take a picture?

Me: It still feels like your trying to reject people by making them do things your way. A date has a reason to discover the person you may like me or not face to face. If you dislike me we get a hike and you have a nice day if you like me it's the same... I was hurt when you blocked me

Him: One chance...

Him: Your painting a picture that portraits me as some guy of vain asshole. Anyone deserve to know who they are meeting. And anyone hiding who they are attempting to pressure a person by telling them they are vain or unfair are deceptive. I guess I'll block you again because a picture is very simple. I sent u one U can do the same but instead I'm a jerk. That's what someone with something to hide would say. Good luck. I shall hike here in town. It's not some egregious request. Sorry to hurt you again but when you decide to not hide I'll be interested.

Me: Do you normally boss potential dates around ? You know I'm a top right ? a mutual Skype would have been better than this. You blocked me again and want me to think your a nice person I don't need to be treated like shit buddy your not my only match. You didn't even say it nicely; eg. I'm afraid for my safety can you please take a pic, you demanded one two times now.

I'm about 30, fairly attractive (so I've been told), and a few months ago I ended an almost year-long relationship with a guy I was head-over-heels in love with. We met on Grindr, which I recognize is not the place to find love, but I'm a teacher (work with mostly women) and not into the bar scene, so it's really hard for me to otherwise meet enough gay guys to really find someone I'm interested in pursuing. The relationship ended pretty poorly, leaving me without much closure, but with plenty of assurance that I am the better person. He's apologized for fucking things up so badly, but I'm over him, and I'm moving on.

I've had some hookups (Grindr/Scruff), and some FWBs from before my relationship have again become part of my life, but while I've been OK with just casual fun, it's starting to feel kinda empty. I want to look for someone who is around my age, attractive, shares my values, is driven, and has his life pretty together.

I've met a few guys who seem great, been on some dates, but I keep getting my heart broken with disappointment, and it's making me depressed:

* Guy 1 turned out to be less mature than I thought (hard drugs playing a big role in his recreational activities), despite him being really smart and sharing a lot of my interests.
* Guy 2 had a good job, his own house, seemed like he has his life together, but I learned he has some serious anger issues (very aggressive, easily set off) and is freshly recovering from some addiction issues.
* Guy 3 has a high-paying job, but that's 50% of what he talks about, and I find it off-putting. He kept wanting me to guess what he drove, talked about how much money his company paid to relocate him, etc...
* Guy 4 (this was just tonight, actually) had been chatting with me for about a month. He's really cute and funny, has a good job, lives near me, and we had some really good conversations. Through the holidays, we chatted about each other's visits home, stayed in touch. He stopped talking for about 5 days, then he suddenly apologizes tonight for avoiding me, telling me he's gotten back with his boyfriend but still wants to hang out and maybe make me a friend. I had no idea there was an ex who he was trying to get back together with, and I was really feeling like we were making a deep connection. 

**Problem 1:** Guy 4, who I was actually really, really starting to like, really devastated me by blowing me off, then telling me he's back with his ex and friend-zoning me. I still find him very attractive, funny, smart, nice... I don't want to be his friend. And I don't even think I'd be OK dating him eventually, if it turns out I was just a temporary rebound until his ex came back. I don't know if I'm offended, disappointed, mad, sad, or a mixture of all four. Is this just par for the course? I hate getting my hopes up, finally thinking I've met someone amazing, just to realize it was nothing.

**Problem 2:** Am I looking for love in all the wrong places, by using dating/hookup apps as a dating pool? What am I doing wrong? I'm a genuine, caring, and probably too-forgiving person. I'm also incredibly busy, holding a teaching job and a second job with a teacher certification program. I'm looking into pursuing a second Master's degree, too, so I don't have a lot of time to sit around at bars (and I don't think it will introduce me to a very different group of guys). Where can I meet guys my age who would be a good match for me?

Even if you don't have answers to my questions, I'd be happy to hear commiserations or advice... I'm just really down about the whole thing, probably even still kinda sad about my breakup, and generally lacking luck in finding someone to love.

I'm not new to the gay life or even sex. Unfortunately, during my exploration, I came to some conclusions that awoke some fears in me:

1- I don't like to be blown. I know the whole ""you've just not met a good blower"", but I've tried it enough time, even when I was in a relationship and it just doesn't do it. I lose my erection. I think it's the fact the guy's attention become focused 'there', I just lose the connection. I get turned on when I can see the guy's face to the same level as me. On the other hand I love to blow and I'm good at it (so I've been told).

2- I've tried to bottom, it didn't work. Even one finger hurts. I wasn't enjoying it at all. I'm unable to develop the will to try by myself since when I'm horny, my only thought is to jerk off (and get rid of my hornyness), not to put my finger there. I always thought I was a bottom since the thought of having a guy topping me turns me on, like a fantasy, but in practice it's not pleasant at all.

3- I'm unable to top... Tried it once, but I was also losing my boner the minute I was trying to put the condoms on.


Therefore, when I see all these guys shouting ""TOP/BOTTOM!112"" or expecting great sex, I feel quite insecure. I'm afraid the possibilities are quite limited with me and it could be a turn off. 

Also, I'm really willing to explore further and discover stuff, but I'm single and I'm unable to develop trust or the will to explore 'deeper' with strangers. :-/

Any advice?

Thank you! 

TL;DR: Shy and single guy doesn't like to be blown, unable to receive a dick in his Mordor, unable to put his boner inside Narnia.

I don't remember ever even feeling attraction towards men at the time but somewhere deep inside I knew it.  As I aged through middle school I realized that I definitely had an attraction to men and it became more and more apparent.

But I don't think anybody really cares about that shtuff.  I'm in 11th grade now and a couple months ago it just kind of hit me that I'm gay.  And it sucks.

Suddenly I'm getting all these urges to be with somebody but the thing is I don't think I could ever come out.  At least in high school.  I'm already quiet and have social anxiety problems and I don't want to end up being a stereotype of 'that one weird quiet gay kid'.  I already have enough going against me socially.  Minor aspergers, social anxiety, anxiety, ADHD.  I'm too stubborn and proud and embarrassed to get  I've got a group of friends now that I hang out with but even then sometimes I feel like I'm just on the metaphorical outskirts of it all.

I know how judgmental other people can be simply because I'm that judgmental and I know it and hate it.

But I digress.  I'm super attracted to taller brutish men which pretty much means I have to date somebody older than like 25, and I don't even think I could go for somebody like that because they're probably way out of my league.  I like to feel protected (probably because of my anxiety issues).

The one thing that I've got going for me is that I'm pretty smart, but I lack the motivation to do anything with it other than get 90s in all my classes while practically doing nothing in/outside of school.  I'm really lazy.

TL;DR I got really off topic but basically angst y teenager stuff and I really don't like being gay.

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR I got really off topic but basically angst y teenager stuff and I really don&amp;#39;t like being gay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT:  Okay guys thanks for the reassurance.  I&amp;#39;m doing fine but it definitely feels good to get some stuff off my chest.  Thanks for everything, you&amp;#39;re all the best.&lt;/p&gt;

So...I'm not sure that this post is asking a specific question. I think I'm mostly posting for general feedback and advice. 

I currently identify as [omnisexual](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pansexuality) and have been seeing a queer female since August. My family has met her and we've explained the nature of our relationship to them. They absolutely love her and have even explained that they like her so much not because she is a woman, but because we are good for one another - And we really do seem to be. 

She recently left for London to visit her family for the holidays and I've been staying with my mother and father here in West Virginia (yup, I grew up in a rather rural and conservative area).  Since then, my mother has made several small comments concerning homosexuals. More than usual. 

Let me give a bit more background info here: My mother is one of seven, grew up in a very abusive family and suffered essentially every form of abuse, and her two oldest siblings were/are homosexual. My mother has never really accepted their sexuality and distanced herself and my sister and I from them for a long time. The oldest, her brother, was queer and he and I are extremely similar. Look, style, interests, sexuality, our mannerisms, and even our sneezes were quite similar. After his death about 8 years ago, my mother began (at least I think) to struggle with her decision to stay clear of him - especially considering they were so close as kids. When I came out...shit hit the fan. 

Alright, fast forward to now. Recently, I was watching Tom Ford's ""A Single Man"" and my mom asked what I was watching. I told her and explained what it was about: A gay man mourning his lover. She left the room saying, ""I don't want to see two men doing it."" This sorta started a small fight because I've been extra sensitive about homophobia and other sexuality issues after people thought I was trying to be straight by dating a woman. I'm not straight, and neither is she. It's the queerest relationship I've ever been in honestly. 

Just an hour ago, I made dinner - because my mother refuses to cook now...
And mom came into the kitchen to get some of the food. She complained about the mess I made and how disrespectful I am because I said ""I made the mess, so it's mine to clean. Don't worry about it."" - which put me on pins and needles. And then saw a naked man posing on a drag queen's profile as I was scrolling through my Facebook feed. She then exclaimed, ""That's a waste if he's gay!"" I IMMEDIATELY flew off the handle. She and I began fighting. She said that only I can have an opinion because I think everyone's is wrong. And I yelled that she needs to learn when to share her opinion and when to keep it to herself and that she needs to reevaluate herself and rethink her values and morals. 

Ok - so, as a twenty-something staying at home (though I'm starting grad school 3 hours away next week) with conservative parents, I know that I can quickly lose my temper and be disrespectful. However...there are some things that I simply refuse to tolerate and that's hateful language and intolerance of others. I thought our relationship was really doing better, but now I'm beginning to think that she is always going to be a passive bigot. Never learning to just accept love as love. 

I hate this because my parent's have only been interested in my current relationship with my girlfriend. Never any of my relationships with men. And they find the ""best"" excuses for it. I was thinking that they genuinely were interested in us for us, not her lady parts. What happens when/if I date a male in the future? This cycle of arguing over sexuality was exhausting 3 years ago...and it still has yet to stop.

Time line here 
2013 June:  meet him he shows up at my door asking if I need my lawn mowed (Yes insert bad porno music even though nothing happened)
2013 July:  tells me he thinks he is bi-curious and he has done stuff with guys before.
2013 August:  Asks to crash on my couch because there is no one at the place he is currently crashing and that he thinks the place is haunted.
2013 September:  Calls me crying that he and his girlfriend have no place to stay because they are being kicked out of their current place.  
•	I invite them to crash on couch for a couple of nights offer them a deal, (both have to get jobs, have to pay me something to cover expenses, rules of house…..  
•	They invite me to join in on a threesome.  
•	He sneaks into my room while girlfriend is passed out and he initiates sex. 
•	He asks me to kick the girlfriend out of the house.  Starts texting me and calling me multiple times a day even while we see each other every day. 
2013 October:  Moves into my room starts sleeping in my bed.  He continues texting me and calling me multiple times a day even while we see each other every day. 
•	He initiates sex stoned, drunk, and sober.  (just so I am clear, I am not a prude, not frigid, nor submissive, however dealing with guys who are not sure what they are I will not initiate).  
•	I invite him to go to my father’s and niece’s birthday gathering.  He meets my family as my “roommate.” 
•	Makes out with me and grinds on me in front of several friends and my neighbor.  Tells them that it is cool that they are so open minded.  
•	Makes out with me and another guy in a straight bar we went to and invites the other guy over for a threesome.  
2013 November:  Tells me that we can’t have sex anymore because it is “Too intense.”    
•	 Days later he continues to initiate sex and still is sleeping in my bed.
•	I inform him that I am falling for him, that if that bothers him he needs to be honest with me.  Seems un-phased by my statement.  
2013 December:  Goes to my Company Holiday party as my date.  Tries to initiate sex in front of the hotel but is way too drunk by the time we make it back to the room.  We spend the morning cuddling naked.  
•	His mother invites me to their family Christmas gathering.  He “really wants me to go.”
•	New Years have the party at “our place”  
2014 January:  Wakes me up in the middle of the night initiates sex, gets up pukes and then tells me he has to sleep on the couch because, he would be tempted and it would be a mistake.  
2014 February through March declares he is straight, moves into the spare room.  I attempt to avoid him but he keeps barging into my room without knocking, invading my personal space, talking to other people about what happened between the two of us with various degrees of accuracy.  One day he will not leave me alone and the next day he avoids me.
2014 March Avoids me for the last 2 weeks of March unless he needs something from me.  
2014 April Catch him making out with another guy.  He walks out of the house throwing his key at me.  We only talk for him to get his belongings out of my house.  
2014 May through June no contact 
2014 July Contact him about mail that showed up for him.  He shows up and ends hanging out at the house for 2 hours.  He starts talking to me as if nothing ever happened between us.  
2014 August He sleeps in my bed the Friday night before and the Sunday night after a trip off roading with friends.  We share the same tent and sleeping bag while on the trip.  Hear from him in some manner everyday for 2 weeks.  When face to face he seems to find ways to invade my personal space (keeps making comments about sex between he and I, flirts with me, asks me to wash off his back, long tight intimate hugs, and acts like he is about to kiss me more than once but then backs off).  Then he just stops all communication with me unless he needs something.  
2014 September through December: I find out he is dating some girl.  I try and cut all ties with him, communication, social media and I ask friends and family not to bring him up.  
2014 December He shows up at my house with a mutual friend.  He tells me that he misses me and he really wants to be friends still.  I spell out what I will accept and what I will not.  
tl;dr: Just a sanity check for myself.  What would you do and think about all this?  Guy initiates sex and then abruptly ends it but wants to remain friends, however he keeps crossing the very boundaries he insists that I should not cross.

2013 December:  Goes to my Company Holiday party as my date.  Tries to initiate sex in front of the hotel but is way too drunk by the time we make it back to the room.  We spend the morning cuddling naked.&lt;br/&gt;
• His mother invites me to their family Christmas gathering.  He “really wants me to go.”
• New Years have the party at “our place”&lt;br/&gt;
2014 January:  Wakes me up in the middle of the night initiates sex, gets up pukes and then tells me he has to sleep on the couch because, he would be tempted and it would be a mistake.&lt;br/&gt;
2014 February through March declares he is straight, moves into the spare room.  I attempt to avoid him but he keeps barging into my room without knocking, invading my personal space, talking to other people about what happened between the two of us with various degrees of accuracy.  One day he will not leave me alone and the next day he avoids me.
2014 March Avoids me for the last 2 weeks of March unless he needs something from me.&lt;br/&gt;
2014 April Catch him making out with another guy.  He walks out of the house throwing his key at me.  We only talk for him to get his belongings out of my house.&lt;br/&gt;
2014 May through June no contact 
2014 July Contact him about mail that showed up for him.  He shows up and ends hanging out at the house for 2 hours.  He starts talking to me as if nothing ever happened between us.&lt;br/&gt;
2014 August He sleeps in my bed the Friday night before and the Sunday night after a trip off roading with friends.  We share the same tent and sleeping bag while on the trip.  Hear from him in some manner everyday for 2 weeks.  When face to face he seems to find ways to invade my personal space (keeps making comments about sex between he and I, flirts with me, asks me to wash off his back, long tight intimate hugs, and acts like he is about to kiss me more than once but then backs off).  Then he just stops all communication with me unless he needs something.&lt;br/&gt;
2014 September through December: I find out he is dating some girl.  I try and cut all ties with him, communication, social media and I ask friends and family not to bring him up.&lt;br/&gt;
2014 December He shows up at my house with a mutual friend.  He tells me that he misses me and he really wants to be friends still.  I spell out what I will accept and what I will not.&lt;br/&gt;
tl;dr: Just a sanity check for myself.  What would you do and think about all this?  Guy initiates sex and then abruptly ends it but wants to remain friends, however he keeps crossing the very boundaries he insists that I should not cross.  &lt;/p&gt;

As the title says....I've been with my boyfriend for about a year and half now, and I am feeling my attraction/feelings for him are beginning to wane. Making it more complicated, he just moved in with me a couple weeks ago.

He is a few years young than me (I am 25) and still in college. I am finding myself frequently frustrated with him and as a result, my attraction towards him is subsiding. 

He is demanding but messy. He frequently asks me to do things for him, whether it be making food, giving him a rub, getting water, etc. and will wine and complain if I don't comply, but when I ask him to do things, like pick up after himself, only about 30% of the time he does what I ask. 

Adding to that, I feel like we both became somewhat complacent. I've put on some weight (nothing crazy, like ten pounds over the course of the relationship) but I still go to the gym frequently so that I don't balloon. Him, on the other hand, hasn't gotten a hair cut in I don't know how long. His hair looks awful and he seldom washes it. He dresses casually all the time, which is usually ok (we're from Cali), but sometimes it be nice if he made an effort. It irks me that he cares so little about his appearance and is stubborn when the people around him (me, his family) tell him he should try a little more to look presentable.

Adding to that, he seems to have no drive or goals. He is enrolled in an elite private university and majoring in physics, but he is so blase about what he wants to do and where he is going. His main priority seems to be when and where he can score more pot. This also frustrates me because I work 40 hours a week, pay all the rent and bills (though his mom is supposed to pay me his share of rent, but I haven't yet received any payment).

So here I am now, a year and a half later, with this boy living in my apartment. Sometime I feel like I am not in a relationship, but instead caring for a child. 

Bros, it's obvious to me that I need to express how I feel to him, but how can I deliver this delicately while still getting my point across. Or, should I jump ship now? If he is not receptive, what should my next move be? Is it dangerous to threaten the potability of him having to move out, even when he just moved in? Is there anything I can do to try to tap into those feelings that initially drew me to him?

tldr: bf is evolving into a dirt bag but just moved in with me -- feeling frustrated and patience is dwindling. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys,&lt;/p&gt;

I want to preface by acknowledging that there are millions of posts regarding coming out here and apologizing for yet another one of those I'm about to write. Reading about other people's experiences here has been tremendously helpful (thank you!), although I do want some help specifically regarding my situation. **Warning: sorry, very, very long. There is a tl;dr version at the end. I appreciate any help and thank you in advance!**

I'm a closeted student about to finish college. I have known that I'm gay since I was in junior high. I might be bi - that I'm not sure of yet, but I do know I like guys and have had relationships with several before. I went through a long phase of denial, trying to convince myself that I was only curious, but later experiences have completely refuted that thought. Throughout most of my college life I have been depressed. I was briefly in a relationship with a guy who was also closeted, but having to keep everything on the down low made it miserable. I then slept around quite a bit, and while hookups were fun at first, every succeeding one of them has left me feeling emptier and emptier. My depression was not severe, but it definitely affected my life on a daily basis - I would lose motivation to work every time I thought about how ugly everything would become if people knew about me and my escapades. When it got tough, I would resort to sleeping to dodge thinking about the issue. My grades went down, I had terrible mood swings, I shut my friends out, etc. I've since adjusted my outlook on life and recovered from my depressed days, but thinking about being gay still makes me sad every now and then.

This might be a good time to briefly describe my background. I was born and raised in a metropolitan area that is very conservative. Speaking of homosexuality is very much a taboo here. Even with the younger generation, discussing the concept of being gay is usually met with prejudice. Some of my closest friends speak of the subject as though they are homophobes, although I never tried to get to the bottom of it and see whether they were actually against homosexuality, or were just joking around.

In contrast, I am very lucky to be going to a top university in one of the most liberal cities in the United States. Getting to know intelligent and openly gay students and professors there has confirmed the notion that you can be gay, successful, and not subject to hateful judgment all at the same time. The disconnect between the environment on campus and that in my hometown on the attitude on homosexuality has bothered me quite a bit. I would dread coming home during breaks because my homophobic friends (I'm making assumptions) and my family are here, and I would start thinking about how shit's gonna go down if people knew about me. I have even planned to never come back to my hometown after graduation and live my life elsewhere, maybe a city near my college, I don't know yet. But definitely not the hellhole that is my hometown.

I am tired of having to assure people that ""I know I'm a catch and will find someone some day"" when I tell them I'm not seeing anyone. I'm tired of telling my friends fake stories about hooking up with girls when I come home over breaks. I have tried putting off the issue, telling myself I still had time to explore so there was no rush to come out, when the truth is I know from the bottom of my heart that I am attracted to guys and there really is nothing I can do to change that. I am currently seeing a guy who doesn't yet know I'm not out, and it once again reminds me that I need to face who I am. 

This year I really want to come out to my closest friends as a first step to embracing who I am, but I'm scared. There will be no going back once the secret is out, and my closest friends are among the most important things in my life. I'm scared that if I lose them, I'll slip into depression again. I can't really afford to be affected by depression again as I'm graduating and it's a critical time to be focused on school/career, but at the same time I don't think I can keep the secret to myself anymore.

There is a list of several friends on my mind that I think it would be okay to come out to, but there is also another list of friends who might react terribly. Among my closest friends, there are some who belong in the first list, some the second. Should I start with the first list anyway, knowing that I will have to behave differently in different settings (e.g. a setting with only friends from list 1 vs a setting with at least one friend from list 2)? It would be highly unlikely for me to become completely out any time soon - for example, I don't picture myself coming out to my very traditional parents in the near future. Should I start coming out to a select list of friends anyway in order to help myself come to terms with who I am?

I realized I've rambled a lot in this post... I have become incredibly lost as to who I am and how I've changed over the past few years, so the above was as good a summary as I could provide. It feels good to just get all that off my chest. Again I appreciate any advice any gaybro here has. If what I wrote seemed rhetorical/unhelpful for anyone to understand my problem, I still thank you for reading it! I do have a lot (almost an offensive amount) more questions, but I think this post is already way too long and you all have more important things to do than reading a boring autobiography...

**tl;dr:** I want to come out, but some of my closest friends are extremely conservative. Is it a good idea to come out to a selected few friends who I think are more open-minded, and keep the ones who I think are less open-minded in the dark for now?

**Edit:** Hey thanks so much for all the replies and PMs so far. I'm so grateful this is such a supportive community. Before this I never had anyone to talk to about these issues, so you have been tremendously helpful. I'll work on replying to everyone's advice.

**Edit 2:** Thanks for the gold!

Among my closest friends, there are some who belong in the first list, some the second. Should I start with the first list anyway, knowing that I will have to behave differently in different settings (e.g. a setting with only friends from list 1 vs a setting with at least one friend from list 2)? It would be highly unlikely for me to become completely out any time soon - for example, I don&amp;#39;t picture myself coming out to my very traditional parents in the near future. Should I start coming out to a select list of friends anyway in order to help myself come to terms with who I am?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realized I&amp;#39;ve rambled a lot in this post... I have become incredibly lost as to who I am and how I&amp;#39;ve changed over the past few years, so the above was as good a summary as I could provide. It feels good to just get all that off my chest. Again I appreciate any advice any gaybro here has. If what I wrote seemed rhetorical/unhelpful for anyone to understand my problem, I still thank you for reading it! I do have a lot (almost an offensive amount) more questions, but I think this post is already way too long and you all have more important things to do than reading a boring autobiography...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr:&lt;/strong&gt; I want to come out, but some of my closest friends are extremely conservative. Is it a good idea to come out to a selected few friends who I think are more open-minded, and keep the ones who I think are less open-minded in the dark for now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; Hey thanks so much for all the replies and PMs so far. I&amp;#39;m so grateful this is such a supportive community. Before this I never had anyone to talk to about these issues, so you have been tremendously helpful. I&amp;#39;ll work on replying to everyone&amp;#39;s advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Thanks for the gold! I&amp;#39;m using a throwaway account, but it&amp;#39;s the thought that counts.&lt;/p&gt;
