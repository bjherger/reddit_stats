One of my friends has recently revealed to his sister, that he is gay.

I am a straight male, but strong advocate for gay rights, and really want to help him out.

He can't tell his parents. They saw he liked something tenuously linked to homosexuality on Facebook, and sat him down to explain why that was unacceptable.

He found some solace online, and has made a few friendships, but I am worried.

So I set up this reddit account, to specifically follow subs that will offer him advice, and a community where he can learn and grow, and just be happy.

Can you suggest some subreddits to follow? And any other advice would be great.

He is christian.

Edit: Today I am passing the account over to him, thanks for the help and advice.

I don't have a lot of people to talk to about this irl so...

(for a bit of context, my BF and I have been dating for a few months and have known each other for about a year. we live in the same dorm and for the most part share all of the same friends. hence why i really can't talk to them about this.)

When he first told me he liked me, I was thrown off because I hadn't thought of him that way before. A few days past and I told him I was sort of unsure but we kissed and it felt great. We were pretty much dating at that point (spent 24/7 together for months) and decided that we should just be together. He's an awesome person. Super nice, empathetic, funny and treats me well.

However I've been noticing downsides lately. His breathe has constantly been unbearable. He'll mouthwash and brush his teeth when I let him know, but it'll usually only help for an hour. He insists on kissing me all the time, which is fine when his breathe isn't sour but usually that isn't the case. I've talked about this with him gently once or twice, and I understand that it isn't his fault. But still it's an issue.

And it seems shallow to say but he's put on a bit of weight recently. Its really showing in his gut/face and it's making my attraction for him dwindle. I know I should only care about who he is as a person and how much he cares for me, but I feel like attraction should be there. I haven't talked to him about this, as it'd be an extremely rude thing to bring up. He has, though, brought up how he wants to lose his stomach, but then continues to skip the gym/diet.

He also isn't the brightest person in the world. Sometimes it's extremely cute and charming. But most of the time he has trouble wording things. Its kind of hard to have conversations with him about out of school/day-to-day stuff because of this.

Because of our living situation (dorms), same friends and a same class, I NEVER go about 3 hours without seeing him. I love free time. I **need** me time. I'm a bit of an introvert. I've told him about this on a few separate occasions. And even though he gets extremely sad, he'll be ok with it and give me a bit of space (like 4 hours) and then come knocking on my door wanting to hang out... Then the next day it'll be back to 24/7 together time. He even insists on always sleeping together!
For example tonight his roommate was working on a project till late and needed the lights on. I can't sleep well with that and on top of it, my BF was rubbing my body the whole time in bed. I've told him a hundred times how when I sleep I like no contact but he isn't getting it (which leads me to my next problem but i'll get to that in a second.) So anyways, I say that I'm going to sleep in my bed and he gets like teary eyed... I mean come on. I need space and I haven't slept in my bed in a while. I tried telling him how it was just that I want only time and he said he knew that and that it was ok. But he still seemed **really** broken up it (i mean teary eyed, distant and quiet.) 

Another thing thats been bothering me is how he is always so horny. I mean his sex drive is crazy. Because of stress from work, school and family matters, my drive has been pretty low. Because of work/school I rarely have time for sex at all anyways. But he is so fuckin pushy with it. He'll just start rubbing my ass or touch my crotch when I'm trying to focus. Then he'll start trying to make out with me (Which he KNOWS gets me horny) when I'm in the middle of studying or something, so I'll tell him to stop and then he gets all pissy. It took me a week and a half of talking to him to get him to finally stop trying to start anal, since I'm not ready just yet. I've been very clear with him about all of this and it seems to resurface every few days.

This is my first relationship at all, and his first with a man (he previously dated women) So if I sound childish or whatever, I apologize. But please give your advice if you wish or even call me out on my bullshit if there was any. Dating is a lot of work and I'm wondering if I fucked up a great friendship by starting something that I'm still not sure about.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve got a few issues here, and was wondering if you all could help give a bit of advice.

Are the girls just a cover? Or is he bi?

If he’s gay/bi, can I tell him that he needs to aim higher? Because the boy servicing him looked sort of nerdy. If he is gay, I don’t want him to sell himself short. There are college gays at my gym I could show his picture to.

For some reason out of the blue I thought of redownloading the app Jack'd just to see the guys down there and make sure he wasn't on (I admit I have problems with jealousy). His hometown is a bigger city and so lot's of guys came up and then there he was, my heart dropped and I felt like shit. I texted him "" I saw you on the app bro  I see how it is, Bye."" and he responded saying he could explain but that is was probably too late and he felt bad etc etc. His explanation was that he was trying to buy weed (We both smoke) and that since he didn't know anyone that sold he got on the app to look. He said he really wanted to smoke with his cousin but that he didn't have any friends so its the only way he could think of.  I then asked him then why did he go through the trouble of posting 3 photos of himself who was he trying to look good for just to buy weed?

It is Sat and not going out because I need to clean my apt :(

Anyway, I'm currently 26, had 3 brief relationships. Last one was more of a FWB thing. Currently single and unsexed for 9 months, have a job, car, etc., I do some cross country running and swimming to stay fit, eat healthy, this can go for a while. No abs yet, but they should be ready by halloween lol

Anyway, I visit this self-help gay vlogger's website and social media. I also do a lot of reading reflecting in Brene Brown's books. Both have great advice that has helped me out tremdously. He has good advise for gay guys and essentially I listen to it as someone who has been single since I came out 5 years ago. I've learned I'm not perfect and that essentially I could not really have insane expectations for potential partners. **He also says how could you expect romance in your life if you don't have room already made for someone in your life**. So, along with gaybros, the vlogger's advice, book reading, and my friends, I've started going on ""practice dates"". I'm very honest with all dates I go on and say it's a friendly get together (implying there's no sex because I'm truly am looking and trying to get past superficial stuff like having sex on the first date).

I'm taking a lot of chances and getting out of my comfort zone by dating different types of guys. So far I've been on 2. I've made a friend of one of the guys and it's getting easier to go on these dates as I don't see them as high pressure.

Anyway, is this still a good idea to continue doing? I always go dutch and never imply any expectations about anything. What brings these dates to fruition is I am interested in knowing more about that person. Sadly, I do this all online and would like to eventually be able to walk up to guys and just ask for numbers and conversation but baby steps I guess.

I'm also taking care of my financials so I could better prepare for the future. I want babies and that shit isn't cheap.

I did also go to clubs/bars by myself and no one I was interested hit on me and I did talk to folks but no sparks either last night. I had a great time still. Not sure if guys think that's weird, but I've done this so many times I'm used to it already. I also spoke with my friend today who asked how was the love life going. I said it's kind of nil, no sparks or more yet. Also, live in a smaller city now, but I love my job and the friends I have made thus far.

On a scale of happiness, I would say I'm 8 out of 10 because my job and boss rock along with everyone I work with. This is from someone who came from a company where my boss flipped a table before and didn't get fired (corporate america too) lol. I've moved around a lot and my best friends are all in different cities so also starting from a new place but I've been literally working on me since I got here hence the no sex for the past few months. It definitely gets tough, but in the words of my divorced brother, ""You can't get an STD from your hand"". I'm fully out so and proud just as an FYI.

I'm open to sex, but it would just have to be the right person now.

He says he's sorry and it will never happen again. I gave him another chance but not sure if that was the right move.

Long version: I haven't been out for very long, and this is my first serious bf that I've ever had, and my first real relationship period (never got into anything serious with a girl before either). For him, this is also his first gay relationship, and his first actual relationship in several years. We met online and started hanging out, and we started off just being ""friends with benefits"" - we'd hang out, fool around in bed, but never really took things further. But after about 3 months of hanging out on a regular basis we decided we liked each other enough to take it to the next level and try a relationship. I made it very clear when we started officially dating that this meant we couldn't see anyone else, and he agreed.

Well, two months into our ""exclusive"" relationship, turns out he ended up hooking up with a friend of his while he was away for a weekend. I found out about it a month after it happened, and when I found out, I was obviously pissed off, but I felt by that point we had known each other long enough that I wasn't going to just dump him on the spot - I wanted him to explain himself. He seemed genuinely upset about it and swore it was a one time thing and never would have happened again. However, I demanded to read his text conversation with this guy from the night it happened, and it turns out my bf seemed to be the one to initiate the hookup, and afterwards he had texted this guy saying how hot he thought the whole thing was (apparently all that happened was this guy gave my bf a BJ and then left...but I'm not sure I buy that). Anyway, I don't know if he's the world's best actor or if he was genuinely upset by it, but I decided to give him another chance. He said it's because this is his first gay relationship (and he is not even out to anyone yet), and he was still a little scared of the idea of settling down I guess, but he has made it clear at this point in our relationship that he cares about me enough not to do it again. 

It's now been nearly 2 months since I found out about all this, but I still will occasionally have second thoughts on whether I made the right decision to give him another chance. I made it VERY clear that if anything like this happens again, there won't be another chance. As far as I know, I haven't noticed any suspicious activity with him since then, but I also don't know if he's just really good at hiding stuff from me.

I came to the realisation that I'm gay near enough 10 years ago now. My friends know, my family for the most part know - although the less said the better in that respect. I lived a very reclusive life, in a bubble, up until a year and a half ago upon coming to University at the age of 22. I'm 24 now. 

At that stage I engaged in light oral sex with a couple of people and enjoyed it, then realised that although I had been told their STD status - I should probably start assuming they weren't strictly telling the truth. A few weeks after I started worrying, on an anxious panic attack-esque level about HIV. This continued over the duration of the year periodically worrying about my status until I got tested and confirmed negative 7 months after the incidents.

Now my issue arises, I can't get over the idea that whoever I have some form of sexual has something waiting for me to catch. Yes, they were hook ups, but I feel completely paralyzed sexually. I don't and never have had a boyfriend, I don't want to be sexually inept when/if I eventually get a boyfriend.

Am I the only one who feels resigned to 6 months of crippling fear of my status after hooking up with a guy? Should I be worrying to this extent? 

There's no other way for me to explain it than sexual paralysis. I feel absolutely terrified at the prospect of catching HIV. I just don't know what to do over this situation.

I was just curious to know when your first relationship was? I'll be 19 soon enough and have never been in one...I'm kind of embarrassed to say that actually. I feel like I'm some type of oddity.

That leads to my second question: have you ever just felt ""unappealing""? I ask this because I'm almost 19 damn years old and have never been with someone. I've either had potential mates that fell apart because we were either too far away or my own insecurities caused them to fail before they began or I come on too strong and ruin a chance before it can form. I've had sex and have done anything...but excluding the blowjob almost a year ago, it's been years since I've had penetrative sex.

While I'm not in the best of shape, it's not like I'm obese or anything either (but I don't even let my own mother see me shirtless). However people in my area seem to be so shallow and let others' bodies decide if they'll answer or not that it ruins my confidence...and no, it doesn't motivate me to get in better shape.

I'm lonely as fuck in other words, despite valuing my solitude.

My questions got sidetracked by me ranting, sorry about that.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Longtime lurker, might as well try and say/ask something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was just curious to know when your first relationship was? I&amp;#39;ll be 19 soon enough and have never been in one...I&amp;#39;m kind of embarrassed to say that actually. I feel like I&amp;#39;m some type of oddity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That leads to my second question: have you ever just felt &amp;quot;unappealing&amp;quot;? I ask this because I&amp;#39;m almost 19 damn years old and have never been with someone. I&amp;#39;ve either had potential mates that fell apart because we were either too far away or my own insecurities caused them to fail before they began or I come on too strong and ruin a chance before it can form. I&amp;#39;ve had sex and have done anything...but excluding the blowjob almost a year ago, it&amp;#39;s been years since I&amp;#39;ve had penetrative sex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I&amp;#39;m not in the best of shape, it&amp;#39;s not like I&amp;#39;m obese or anything either (but I don&amp;#39;t even let my own mother see me shirtless). However people in my area seem to be so shallow and let others&amp;#39; bodies decide if they&amp;#39;ll answer or not that it ruins my confidence...and no, it doesn&amp;#39;t motivate me to get in better shape.&lt;/p&gt;
