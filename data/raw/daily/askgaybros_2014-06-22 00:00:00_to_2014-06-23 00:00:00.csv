I just recently came out in Nov 2013.  
The first guy I dated, we became fast boyfriends.  
We took the relationship way too quickly and I definitely got a sense that we were two different people heading in two different directions in life.  
In Feb 2014, after three months of monogamy, I called it off with him.  
  
For about the next three months, I was single and ready to get fucked.  
I met a decent amount of guys, went on some dates, some good, some bad.  
I went on some hookups, some good, some bad.  
For the most part, I liked being a slut.  
  
Towards the end of May, I met a guy, went on a few dates with him, which is rare to find someone who mutually wants to meet up again.  
Last Tue, we talked about being exclusive after seeing each other at least three times a week.  
I agreed because I thought this is what I wanted; to be in a happy relationship with a hot guy I could trust.  
  
I have been faithful to my promise, but I'm really missing getting pounded by a different guy every night.  
It was exhilarating, I felt wanted, I could be with guys who didn't want commitment and/or wanted to be discrete.  
The sex with him is good, but not great.  
I've turned away all my regulars and the guys I promised to meet up in which sex was insinuated, all of which felt awful to do. 
  
It hasn't been a week and I don't know whether I'm going through slut withdrawal or I'm not ready to be exclusive.  
I think we're taking things too fast and I need more time to adjust, get to know him, build our friendship, and still sleep around, but he said we're moving very slowly.  
It feels like I'm repeating my first relationship.  
I don't want to lose him as a friend, but I feel that if I go back on my word, that he'd never want to see me again because he's said that he has no problem dumping a guy who isn't faithful.  
  
I'm just not sure if what we have is worth keeping.  
I just don't know if I'll be happier losing him and seeing if I can pick up where I left off with my slutacious ways or staying with him knowing I have someone dependable, but everything's not ideal.

Our story: We're a LDR that have been together for 7 months. He lives in NJ and I live in Alberta Canada.

I'm absolutely in love with him and I'm sure he's very much in love with me.

During those two weeks, I lost my virginity and so did he. We're both 20 (I paid with my tax return to get there, I'm very poor).

Just... it felt like he didn't enjoy doing anything *to me*, and honestly, it kind of hurts in a way I cannot explain. I just... loved pleasing him in every way I could (I'm the top, he's the bottom, he loves being the bottom). To me, seeing him really enjoy his first BJ or whatever else I did for him just... made me feel really good, really, really good.

But. He has a hard time doing anything for me. It's a struggle for him. In my dramatic mind I'm thinking, I did all this for him because I wanted him to be happy, seeing him happy made me happy... I'd do anything for him... but he had a hard time even touching me down there.

We talked a bit about it but I don't want to tell him that it really, really hurts me. He says he's horrible at all that and that he'll try and get better but it's just his body isn't using to doing stuff like that.

What does that mean? I almost want to say ""if that's the case, are you even gay?""

Which leads me to my main issue...me.

While in the closet I mostly abandoned my extrovert personality(Tough and interesting process). Being an introvert instead seemed alot more safe for me. I've developed some sort of switch inside of me where I can easily turn it off or on, sadly the switch is only operable when I'm approached by someone that I can see myself being comfortable with.

I think too much, I judge too much, I'm constantly trying to examine and plan out situations in my head. It's kind of driving me insane lol. I want to just live in the moment, the days of being in the closet are over but yet I still find myself looking both ways before doing practically anything.

Anyone else out there experiencing these type of issues and if so have you found some sort of practice to help relieve the constant mind calculations?

PS: I don't drink alcohol but from what I understand it's really good in opening yourself up. If it's the only way then sure I'll go for it but it just seems kind of depressing.

I am in town visiting my family right now (I moved after high school and never came back) and have suddenly come to the realization that I have used my family as the opposite of a role model. In better words, instead of having someone in my family to look up to, I think I have always looked at my family as an example of how NOT to be when I grow up. 

**Please don't misunderstand, though.** I love my family and my family loves me, and we do not have any problems with each other at all. We get along great. 

98% of my family lives in the second most populated county in Florida, so it is a very urban location. In my opinion, my family is pretty much terrible at anything I would call responsibility. I grew up poor as fuck to a family that reproduces way too many children and has no idea how to handle money responsibly. Between both of my parents, I have 7 brothers and 9 sisters. They are all my ""half-siblings"" since I am the only child that came from my mom and my dad procreating. I'm pretty sure my parents were never in a serious relationship, but from the stories I've heard I'm pretty sure they lived together for about 10 months total during my being made. 

About money: they just have no idea what it is to spend responsibly. When I was a wee little lad, one of my parents was a huge drug dealer for a while and we had lots of money until I was about 7 years old. They made a decision to leave drug-dealing alone and we were quickly back to being broke. And by broke, I mean the house was foreclosed on and one of the cars were repossessed. (They referred to the situation as ""we lost the house"" and ""we lost the car,"" presumably to make light of the situation maybe? You know, these crackers have no right to come take your shit even if you aren't paying for it, right?) Things got better eventually after many of my brothers and sisters got jobs to help with the bills. 

7 years later when things were going fine, my parents decided to buy a ""vacation house"" in another state. The house was cheap as fuck, but we still could not afford it responsibly. When my parents asked my opinion, 14 year old me told them ""This is how much we have coming in every month. This is how much money we currently have going out every month. This is how much money we have in savings. This is how much money we will have going out if you buy this house. We'll be broke again in less than 2 years."" 2 years later, we were broke again to the point where my moms husband grew easy veggies in our back yard. I worked at a grocery store and was pretty open with my boss about it and he let me take home damaged food products. This is how we survived for about a year. In the mean time, my mom started doing some home-care work on the side. 2 months into that job, **BAM!** Huge car accident and settlement. They used the settlement money to pay off the house and cars, etc. They will never learn their lesson.

My family is also completely useless when it comes to newer and modern things. Its like they refuse to open their minds to learn anything new. Computers and the internet in general baffle most of them (even in 2014.) I understand that technology is not for everyone, but I'm a web developer so it kind-of irks me when my parents ask me to check their bank account balance because they can't get the internet to work. My mom seriously buys new computers every few years to play solitaire on. I guess its worth mentioning that she can't grasp the concept of the newer Spider Solitaire *at all.*

All of my brothers and sisters are complete fucking whores. Apparently my sisters have really good P and my brothers all have huge dicks which attracts everyone. I never liked sleeping over at their houses growing up because it honestly bothers me that they constantly bring home different people to sleep with every night. On top of this, I am currently 24 years old and I have 41 nieces/nephews. I have a hard time remembering their names since my name database in my brain is so full from other family members. Two of my sisters are currently pregnant and one of my brothers ""possibly has a baby on the way"" from some random chick who he is not in a relationship with. 

I don't think my family is outright racist, but they do often make comments about ""them nasty crackas'"" and ""betty crockers"" etc when pointing out the differences between ""white culture"" and ""black culture."" This part has always bothered me and I speak up about how ignorant they are when they make those statements. 

Today while visiting my family, I overheard my uncle saying that he was getting ready to buy a new SUV because his needs to be replaced since its old and having so many problems. This piqued my interest since I'm a fucking Macgyver when it comes to consumer credit and the car buying process. I asked him what kind of SUV he wants, and he said ""Anything thats not too expensive, I can afford $300-$400 per month."" I was really taken back by this since in my opinion, a vehicle is probably the second most expensive asset that you will probably own in your lifetime, so when it comes to vehicles I only buy EXACTLY the vehicle that I want, not just ""anything I can afford with this amount monthly.""  I started asking him some questions about his credit scores (he hasn't pulled a report in about 6 years) and previous car finance company (he has no idea, it was a subprime lender who went out of business after financing his last SUV.) In my mind, I can't let him just run out there and buy something when he's not even sure what he wants. We came up with a game-plan to responsibly and profitably purchase an SUV and I will help him over the next couple of months with all of this. 

Also today, one of my sisters asked me to find something in the glove compartment of her new car. I found it, but also found the finance paperwork for her new car (I wasn't exactly snooping, it was right there) which boasted a 16% interest rate on a $24k loan for a car worth $19k according to Kelly Blue Book. This is the most irresponsible auto loan I've ever seen, especially since she already has an SUV that she decided to keep when she bought this new car. 

I think I have given enough examples to show you guys what its like growing up in this type of family. The sad part is that I can go on and on and on about the life my family lives that I believe is not responsible. I am very grateful that I realized this early enough to circumvent it. I have always had friends of all cultures, I have never been racist in any way, I have always had a strong desire to be financially smart and successful, I have always wanted to be the best and be wealthy and healthy and every positive light that people look for in others. I even dated a white guy for 4 years.

**I guess I'll get to the point now (TL;DR?)**

Since I was coming down to visit anyway, I got myself a hotel on the beach to chill and enjoy the beach while I'm here visiting. I thought I'd look for some company in the usual ways (Grindr, Growlr, Adam, Craigslist, etc) and it hit me like a ton of bricks...: Although my profiles are well articulated and normal, every single black person who contacted me did so with these: 

* WATS GOOD
* WHAT UP
* DAMN YOU FINE
* AYE WHAT YOU DOIN TODAY
* LEMME SEE THAT ASS
* LETS FUCK RAW
* HEY

...etc. I'm not kidding. 100% of the messages I received from black guys were just... bad, with no effort to spell things right, most refused to turn off caps lock, and just generally off-putting and useless messages of them trying to get into my pants and smoke my weed. 

* Does this happen to you often?
* If you are a non-black guy who refuses to give black guys a chance, is this part of the reason? (Feel free to use a throwaway... I'm genuinely curious and not trying to put anyone down for their preferences.)
* What will it take to get the general population to understand that not ALL black people are ghetto-as-fuck hoodlums? 
* Any other general banter you'd like to add to the discussion?

All I want is to be given a chance by everyone of all races. Something tells me that I am misrepresented in the black community and because of this many people have outright written off black people from their possible dating/hookup preferences. While I know that its a good way to weed out the bad racist people, it still hurts every time to see how my culture reflects on our society in such a negative way sometimes.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to start off by saying that I am black and my family is ghetto as fuck.
