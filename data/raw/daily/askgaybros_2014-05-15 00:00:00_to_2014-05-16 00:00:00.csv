I found the guys email he was talking to and asked him some questions about the nature of the relationship.  My boyfriend said it was only a few times and was just some pictures.  He told me it was so long ago, he didn't remember.  I told my boyfriend before I talked with .. We will call him.. Ray.  That he had a chance to tell me everything.  He said he already did.  He is really torn up, I beleive it was just his way of protecting me, and our relationship, but I have never been more deeply hurt.  If I don't have trust and the abiltiy of him to admit his mistakes regardless of the consequence what do we have.  I am really numb at the moment.  I quit smoking a few years ago and really want one..  I love the guy, and want to be with him, however I don't know if it will ever be the same or if it just feels bigger than it is at the moment.  I have included the email chain with identifiers removed.

1-Listen.. I just found out my bf was talking to you among other things.  I need to know what happened..  Did he cheat on me?  Who are you and why did he start chatting with you.. where do you live? I would appreciate the truth from you, any details.  Please I need to know its destroying me..

Reply - Wow, hey man, I'm sorry to have interfered. We never met up. I go to school in ------ and live in------. As far as cheating on you, we never did anything. I hope you forgive me and your boyfriend. He really does love you. 

2 -How many times did you talk?  Has this been going on a while?  why do you say he really loves me?

Reply - I haven't spoken to him in months. And I say that because we only talked about you. He wouldn't stop bragging about you. He did send a few pics of you two (without faces) and you do have a great body. I know he loves you. 

3 - Did you use kik with him? how many times did you chat and what about?

Reply - No KIK. Prolly for about three weeks or so? And just flirting. He sent me a video of you guys (again, no faces) and just like three or four pics.

4 - Like everyday, back and forth?  Or just a few times?  Was he looking for anything?  Did he tell you much?  I apprecate this.. I need to know for my piece of mind.  I can't figure out if he did this with others, or what.. or why.

Reply - Maybe 3-4 times a week? No, we both never looked to meet or do stuff. Not even Skype. We just talked about sex we both liked and stuff like that. It was super long ago. I honestly don't remember much. I'm so sorry, man. I know I'm at fault for this too. 
 
5 - How did you meet?

Reply - I honestly have no idea. Maybe Reddit?

Reply -  And of course, if you have any other questions, feel free to ask. I'm so sorry. I am really embarrassed. I just know your boyfriend really does love you and he does care about you. 

6 - I just don't know about him.  Why would he do this.  I think I am going to leave him.. I cant live with him.  And the stuff in drop box and the length of
 time.. how old are you even?

Reply - I don't even know what is in that Dropbox. I deleted it and everything he sent. I know he's hurt you. I know I've hurt you. I'm so sorry. You don't have to leave him. He truly loves you. 
Why would he do this, only he can answer that. :/
And I'm --

7 - Well thanks for replying. -----, or ---.. 

Reply - I hope you two work things out. Sorry man. :/

8 - Did he want you?  What was he looking for?  I feel so betrayed.. Its not your fault it is his.  How can I know he did nothing else.  It is so easy to find people if you want.  I thought I was special to him, but he treated me like I meant nothing.

Reply - No, he never wanted me. I wanted you two. He was just looking to talk to someone while you were at work. I remember that he would say how he'd wait for you to come home so that you could fuck him. The language we used was graphic but it was about you two. I honestly forgot where either of you two work. I also remember he said he loved it when you tied him up and had sex. I don't think he did stuff with anyone. He was really emotionally and physically in love with you. And it is part my fault. I'm so sorry, man. :(*

I don't really have anyone I know that I feel comfortable talking this out with.. so what say you Reddit?

Thanks.

I'm not about to come out of the closet to them (I've told my brother and sister, and they were shocked so I'm quite sure my parents don't know, but everyone else in my life knows). I just want tips on how to get out of this suffocating life.

I want to live by myself. I have the means to support myself (I'm finishing university this year and already have a quite well-paying job). I just want to be like the normal Australian families where kids move out when they can support themselves (I'm 23) and not like my stupid traditional parents who want me to get married before they can let go of me. My ideal prospect is to find my own place to rent and find a housemate a few weeks after settling in.

I've not come out to my parents because I'm not sure what their reaction would be. I've recently told my brother and sister, who have also kind of advised against telling them right now because they'll probably try to control my life even more than they try to do now. My brother even gave me examples of my other family members who have basically lived with their lie and got married and had kids etc to please their parents. I am **definitely NOT** doing that. I am my own person and want to live my life the way I want to live it. If I knew they'd kick me out of the house if I came out to them, then I'd have already done this, because it would be an easy way for me to get out, but I know they won't, they'll just try to send me to some priest or tell me it's wrong and I'll grow out of it or something. It sucks, I know, and I wish my parents could be supportive like a lot of other peoples', but I really have to live with the reality of my situation. It also doesn't help that my sister who is 30 and single also still lives at home...

Also, on another note, I'm not the type of person that can just 'up and leave' not caring what they think. I don't want to be on bad terms with my parents. I want to show them a level of respect that they deserve, because they raised me, and I think they did quite a good job of it, even though we have completely different ideologies. I don't want to never see them again, I don't want them to feel terrible about the situation because they both have health problems. But if worst comes to worst then I can and will do that.

Sorry this kind of turned into a rant towards the end but I really just want to hear of some of your experiences if you have a similar situation to mine. I really really *really* need to get out because I seriously feel as though I am suffocating 90% of the time. I'm going overseas in a month for 4 weeks so I'll be away for a while but this feeling will just come back stronger than ever after that.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;OK so my parents are really traditional/religious (i.e. they&amp;#39;re Catholic) and they expect me to stay living at home with them until I get married etc.&lt;/p&gt;

TL;DR boyfriend of 2 years and I broke up in February after I had fallen extremely ill. We met up last night, had a blast, I told him I loved him and he said he loved me, and ended up having sex. Got a text from him this evening saying he didn't want to be more than friends.

A couple months ago, my boyfriend of two years and I split up. Basically, I was diagnosed with a serious illness last year, and had to put my love life on hold while I dealt with that at first. He was so awesome, and stuck by me through it all. Towards the beginning of 2014, I had begun to mentally shut everyone out, including him, and fell into depression because of my illness, which obviously put a strain on our relationship and ultimately led to our break up. Following the break up, I severed all contact with him and went my own way for a while. Last month, I discovered he already had a new boyfriend, but he had been asking a mutual friend of ours about how I've been. I decided that I'd contact him and try to meet up, and we did. It was pretty awkward, and we were both kind of quiet and making snappy remarks to each other, but it didn't go too terribly. After we met up, he texted me saying that he didn't wanna be friends with me, and that we shouldn't talk. Fast forward to yesterday, I found out that him and his boyfriend had broken up, and that triggered something in me that really made me miss him. I've been having suicidal thoughts lately, and I can say I've never been more depressed in my life (I'm addressing this with my doctor tomorrow, and seeing a psychologist) and I've really been missing him, so I told him I wanted to see him. He was very reluctant, but gave in. I went over to his house and we sat outside and talked for a good hour. We were laughing and joking around, like nothing had happened. I confessed that I still loved him, and he told me he loved me as well, but he didn't want to be with me, and told me that he wanted me to get over him. We talked about that for a while and moved on to other misc. things, then he ""jokingly"" brought up that he had considered contacting me before to ask for a booty call, and I told him that I would've been perfectly fine with that. Long story short, we ended up having sex, which I initiated. When we were done, we hung out with another mutual friend of ours that lives with him, and we were all getting along great. Needless to say, after that I was pretty confused about where we were exactly headed.

All throughout today, he was on my mind. The thoughts of being together again with him and all the fun memories we shared together were playing in my head all day. A few hours ago, he texted me and basically told me that last night was a mistake and it never should have happened, and that he only wants to be friends. He said he still loves me, but not like *that*. I was devestated when I read that at first, but then something clicked in me and I guess all of my emotions either turned off or I'm okay with just being friends with him, because suddenly I didn't feel sad; I actually felt relieved. I guess the truth is I really just missed his company as a person and wanted him to remain a part of my life. We are awesome friends and we get along great, and I love him. I just don't wanna ruin anything with him in the future if I, say, have a relapse and start loving him again. Even right now, I'm getting these moments of complete hopelessness and devestation, and I'm not sure if it's because I was rejected by the man that I thought I loved, or if it's something else. I guess I'm just asking if you guys have any advice for me? I really don't want to lose him or remove him from my life. He's my best friend, and basically my family.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey there bros, I&amp;#39;m in a really shitty situation at the moment.

they broke up :(
and the neuroscientist guy had a new boyfriend the following week, that was two years ago and the neuroscientist guy is still in a  relationship with the new boyfriend. 

but the schizophrenic guy told me he wants to get back together with the neuroscientist guy, I told him it wasn't a good idea.

the schizophrenic guy was thinking of living in his car since he can't hold on to his job much longer,he also thinking of just packing his bags and leaving and driving to California to start a new life cause he think that people in his current city are out to get him. ( the last part could be in his head).

Overall I don't think he hasn't much money, So I don't know what to do for him now.

I've been having emotional issues lately and I need help to sort things out. If you hang through all of this post, **thank you very much for helping someone like me**, if not then this was an outlet express my feelings at this moment. So, this past weekend and after 5 years, I walked past the stage to be awarded my 2 degrees. Everyone was happy for me and then we had a party that night. Everyone was congratulating me, saying that they were proud of me, wishing me the best and saying that I deserved it. But inside I felt nothing, I felt empty. I accomplished my lifelong dreams of getting a wonderful job at a top firm and graduating from college with honors, but I felt nothing. I feel like a whiny bitch for saying all of this since I know that many people would trade places with me but I would really think about that twice (lol). Other people around the world are is worse positions and here I am feeling “depressed.” 


Now that I have finished college, I feel like I have no direction anymore. My life isn't structured like it used to be and that scares me. I’m starting to have a quarter-life crisis at 23. I understand I will die some day but I will not accept the concept of impermanence. I understand that life has no meaning and that we are forced to move forward until the time for our eternal sleep approaches. I do not know what my future holds but I am not setting the bar high again in order to not be disappointed.


I know I will excel at my job because I will exert my utmost effort to be successful. I excel at things when I work hard for them (my degree, working out, etc). However I am not looking forward to dating despite my strong desire for companionship at the moment. I have read the horrors about shallowness, racial preferences, flakiness and sex from various sources, plus I’m very needy at the moment. I’m Latino, 5’5, 170 lbs, 24% bf, with acne prone skin and scars on my face and body, along with stretch marks due to being fat, and a kissless virgin. I’m not the first thing that catches your attention nor am I great “on paper” and I get that. What makes it worse is that I am delusional and expect someone to notice me when I don’t put myself out there (**facepalm**). [This is my current motivation motto for working out](http://i.imgur.com/h3RLWVXl.jpg) and I know it will set me up for failure *sigh*. 


Finally my cousin has said to me that being negative is not gonna get me anywhere since it shows outwardly (my demeanor) but I feel like it has been ingrained into my personality. I've internalized all my negative feelings and have become somewhat of a cynic/sarcastic person. Don't get me wrong, my closest friends say I'm sweet and funny but I do have my sarcastic humor or cynical moments. 


I've always worked hard for everything that I have accomplished and sometimes I wonder what it feels like to be given something for free instead of working so hard to get it and then feeling unsatisfied. I feel like my life is always contingent on something else and question when I will truly be happy. All of this together with trying to find a way to come out of the closet is about to drive me insane since I am left with my thoughts more than I would like (no social life). Alright end rant.


P.S. I have tried therapy and loved it, I'm just overwhelmed at the moment.
