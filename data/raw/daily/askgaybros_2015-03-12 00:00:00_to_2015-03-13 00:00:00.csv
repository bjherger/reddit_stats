Long story short here, but my partner and fiance of 6 1/2 years cheated on me last month, and has totally become a totally different person, someone who is completely foreign to me.  From his behavior and his actions and history of anxiety, I honestly believe he is having a manic episode and/or undiagnosed bipolar.  The warning signs are all there: high highs, low lows, reckless behavior, cheating (another sign), unreasonable amount of confidence lately, massive amount of spending, etc.  

Over the course of a month, he is now pretty much ready to move out of our home, into an apartment, to ""spend some time and figure out himself"".  I'm not naive, and I dont really think he ""fell out of love with me"" because I feel that I would have noticed this.  Its only been a month and he is now a completely different person than i've known for this long.  As mentioned earlier, we dealt with something similar when he was diagnosed with anxiety earlier, (didn't cheat but was restless, nervous, paranoid) but no other warning signs whatsoever throughout our entire relationship that would have given some background to his sudden and massive behavior change.

I guess my question is, how do I help someone through this? Don't get me wrong, i'm not relating that ""when he gets better that means he will come back to me"", rather I am worried about him and his mental health and going down a dangerous path left unattended.

Any suggestions?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Everyone&lt;/p&gt;

Basically; im 20 years old; and I had a 20yr old boyfriend of 6 years, he broke up 3 weeks ago. I feel like i should keep trying to get him back; but part of me knows i have to eventually stop trying to get him back. But; i know in the gay community; a long term relationship like this isnt easy to find. At 6 years; i thought i found the guy i would marry; eventually get kids and such. And I know he loved me back; We broke up right after a loud fight over nonsense; We were doing fine before the fight; but it was a particularly loud shouting match; and ended up in a breakup; But i feel it was mainly fueled by the argument; and wasn't premeditated.
To all the guys out there struggling in the singles world; like i am about to face now; Should i give up on this guy and move on? Will i be fine, and eventualyl find a good guy though dating? Or did i happen to stumble across 1:1000000 true love; and should i do everything and anything to get him back; spending months writing sappy letters trying to get him back. I know finding a long relationship like this was pure luck; and i really fear entering a dating or hookup scene.

Im extremely confused about the relationship; Because 1 week after we broke up; we 'stayed friends' and have since been doing multi-hour long skype calls every day while playing video games; and he even invited me to his house to eat pizza and play video games for 8 hours. (and this was 2 weeks after breaking up). But to my slight advances; he acts cold and friendzoney. What should i think? If he actually wanted me out of his life; he wouldn't invite me over for pizza. I just find it incredibly strange that being friends is actually working 2 weeks later; We laugh and have fun. I feel like if it was actually the end of our relationship; we wouldnt still have that chemistry; We wouldnt still have fun together eating pizza chilling in a room for hours on end.
Im not sure what to do at this point though; I need some help from other hopeless romantics; or lonley hearts of /askgaybros/. Do i chase this guy? Do i make a move while hanging out with him? I really fear messing up the friendship we have; But i only see the friendship as a way of getting back together. I would never be happy just being his friend.
my current plan is to wait for the weekend; and if i happen to go to his house to hang out in the 'friendzone'; ill make some sort of move. Considering a letter/comic; im artistic and he likes that stuff.

I still question if this was the right sub to post this in. But;my question pertains to gay culture in a few ways

-In gay culture; is staying friends with exes 'normal' does it ever tend to work? I hear that LGBT exes sometimes stay friends because they dont relate as well to other people.

-In gay culture; where its hard to find the right guy with a culture of hookups; should i ever give up on this guy; or is finding a 6 year relationship this young one-in-a-billion

-Maybe personal experience from gaybros; growing up with a gay partner from the age of 15 gives a close bond; coming out to family together, navigating high school bullying.

-I really wish i had a gay uncle or someone to talk to about this. My parents and everyone seem to see this split as a tiny 'college boyfriend'. But 6 years it feels closer to divorce; So outside advice from people who have been though similar would be helpful.

-Should i give up; And move on? Or do i not even realize how lucky i was; and chase this guy back as hard as i can? Any advice going to really help me as a young gay guy still trying to wrap his head around the complex gay world &gt;.&lt;

Im currently in the stage of considering grindr hookups. But i really need to decide if im done with my EX or not. Im currently too held up thinking about trying to get him back; even though ive gotten plenty of grindr messages; it still feels like cheating.  Would having a hookup even make me feel liberated? Hard at this point while still not having decided if im giving up on my ex....

I've never really told this full story to anyone so I may go into what seems like unrelated or unimportant details. 

**Because I ended up writing a whole novella in this post I'm putting the TL;DR up here for people who don't want to read my life story:**

**TL;DR:** Fell hard for my RA, became really good friends as a result, fucked up and went too far with my feelings and thought I ruined it entirely so I dropped contact with him after school year ended. Fast forward about a year he seems like he's still interested in being friends, and I've lost most of my romantic feelings toward him by now. Should I pursue the friendship or not mess with it? If I do go for it, is it worth trying to reconcile the way I treated him before or just ignore it and try to start clean? I'm very confident that even if I did start seeing him more often again the chances of me falling for him again are slim to none. 

*For the dedicated ones who care to read the full context and severity of my fuck ups. Like I mentioned before, this is something of both a rant as well as giving the actual story as well so it ended up being a really really fucking huge wall of text:*

To give just a little bit of context: at the time this story takes place I'm 18, still closeted, never been in a relationship or done anything sexual with guys or girls, and just starting dorm life in my freshman year of college.

So it's the first week of college and my floor (an all guys floor, by pure chance) was having its first floor meeting of the year. My RA, let's call him Tom, walked in and god dammit this man was hot. Just my luck, right? I get to live on an all guys floor (granted, only a few were even remotely attractive) with a smoking hot RA; living the dream for a gaybro, right? Wrong, closeted little me was a horny motherfucker who didn't know how to control his emotions in high school for the 6 hours I was there per day, let alone full-time in college every day. The obvious chain of events goes down, I develop a major crush on Tom and for a few months nothing really happens. I quickly adjust to college life, make friends, etc. Despite good grades and slowly making great friends, and even starting the coming out process (!!!) I started getting kind of obsessed with Tom. After getting to know most of my floor mates I got to know Tom a little better after being put into a  group with him for a class we had together.

Despite the raging crush I had for Tom I was genuinely becoming good friends with him. We'd start to hang out to do things other than work, got to know each other, etc. In hindsight I realized that the only reason I was as excited as I was about that friendship going so well was because I had the hots for Tom, but that's kind of irrelevant right now. A few weeks pass and the first (what should have been) red flag goes off for me. Basically I figure out Tom had sex with some girl that some other guys on the floor had sex with and *oooh drama* or whatever. Either way, for some reason when I heard that Tom had sex *with a girl* that's when I lost hope that he was gay or would even possibly see me as a romantic interest. But it was more than that, I felt betrayed for some reason, to the point that I wanted to confront him about it as though I were a wife that just figured out her husband was cheating on her. Either way, in hindsight this should not have happened; red flags everywhere with the way I was feeling then.

After that I kind of backed off, midterms had gone past and finals were coming up quick. Nothing really had developed as far as my feelings toward Tom. I was still infatuated with him, but held back the feelings because I started to realize that I was creating a genuine friendship. Although it didn't help that we had hall-style housing so every now and then I'd see Tom walking to the shower in just a low-hanging towel and then dripping wet in the same state of undress heading back to his room...*unf*

Finals were coming up and Tom needed help with math (we were in the same course but different sections). He had a huge whiteboard in his room (he had a single) so he did most of his studying there and, since I was the only one who was really willing to sit down and help him learn the material, I ended up being alone with him in his room more often than not. At some point between midterms and finals I ended up coming out to my family and close friends. Additionally, Tom now had a girlfriend he was really into, and would come to get advice from me. As finals kept getting closer I found myself studying with both Tom and is GF, which was the 2nd big red flag because that pissed me off that I didn't have Tom all to myself during our study sessions anymore. Although it was probably for the better because when it was just me and Tom I would just make things worse for myself by just staring at him whenever he wasn't looking in my general direction. It's also worth noting at this point that I had established that my obsession with Tom was a real serious issue and was ""making an effort"" to deal with it. Apparently taking him out for a walk and telling him I thought he was hot was the answer to that (I had already come out to him before then). Either way despite being fully aware of my feelings we still had those one-on-one study sessions in his room alone. 

After most of my finals are done I still haven't really recovered from the stress and I fuck up. Hard. To avoid dredging up all the  details I'll summarize: I asked him for nudes. Which was completely out of left field and also breaking the boundaries of a comfortable friendship (at least that's what I thought, thinking about it after the fact). Although, he responded less extreme than you would think. Instead of freaking out like a normal person probably would he responded with something like ""that's pushing the boundaries of a comfortable friendship just a bit too far."" as though it was only just out of his comfort zone instead of *really not okay.* Either way, after getting his response and realizing what I just did I panic, thinking I just ruined a friendship. I run into him by chance in person shortly after and apologize profusely. Somehow he just brushes it off like it wasn't a big deal.

With that, the fall semester ends, me and Tom don't really hang out over break, but Spring semester is a little different. Turns out Tom failed a few classes and is now behind and I'm ahead, so we don't have many classes together. I still see him around but we don't hang out as much as we used to, I attribute this to the fact that we aren't studying every night for finals and pass it off. But at this point I've decided within myself that I need to change something about the way I approach my friendship with Tom so I back off a lot. I stop initiating things with him, I don't really hang out with him outside of the dorm much anymore and overall I'm being an awful friend because Tom broke things off with his GF over winter break and he probably needed me to be there for him.

Somehow, as the semester goes on the awkwardness of my earlier fuck up starts to fade and Tom and I are hanging out like normal again. Again, at some point between midterms and finals things start to pick up and then comes brilliant me with fuck up number two. I still have no idea what I was thinking when I did this, but out of the blue a text Tom and ask him how big his dick is^^somuchcringe. Again, totally out of left field, maybe not breaking the boundaries of a comfortable friendship but definitely pushing it hard. He responds, clearly not OK with the question and I fuck up again and kind of go off on him *for not being OK with telling me how big his dick is*. Like...come on me, what the fuck.

At this point I came up with the idea that I wasn't actually friends with him at all and just hanging out with him in hopes of being able to do...you know I don't even know what it was that I wanted from him exactly. At this point I make the wrong decision again and decide that I'm just not going to be friends with him because I'm not actually in it for the friendship I'm just in it so I can use him as my own personal eye candy or whatever it is I wanted from him.

Fast forward to Spring semester the next year (aka now), Tom no longer lives on campus and I rarely saw him around before this semester, and now I have a class with him this semester. He sits next to me and acts like there hasn't been an awkward 10 months of little to no contact between us and starts a conversation like nothing even happened. So I can only assume that despite treating him like actual shit and pushing some crazy boundaries when we were actually hanging out frequently, this guy still wants to treat me as a friend. So this is where I need advice: do you think it would be a bad idea to try to make a proper friendship with Tom now that I don't have feelings for him? If I do go for it, is it worth trying to reconcile the way I treated him before or just ignore it and try to start clean? At this point I don't really have any feelings for the guy romantic or sexual, so it would be a genuine just friends type of relationship if I decided to try and fix things. 

Holy jesus that ended up being so much longer than I thought it would be. This was the first time I really told this story in full to anyone, though. So it's nice to have it out so I'm not dwelling on it. Also, if you read through my entire wall of text instead of the TL;DR I commend you and also thanks for taking the time to read my life story/rant/novella.

He had a huge whiteboard in his room (he had a single) so he did most of his studying there and, since I was the only one who was really willing to sit down and help him learn the material, I ended up being alone with him in his room more often than not. At some point between midterms and finals I ended up coming out to my family and close friends. Additionally, Tom now had a girlfriend he was really into, and would come to get advice from me. As finals kept getting closer I found myself studying with both Tom and is GF, which was the 2nd big red flag because that pissed me off that I didn&amp;#39;t have Tom all to myself during our study sessions anymore. Although it was probably for the better because when it was just me and Tom I would just make things worse for myself by just staring at him whenever he wasn&amp;#39;t looking in my general direction. It&amp;#39;s also worth noting at this point that I had established that my obsession with Tom was a real serious issue and was &amp;quot;making an effort&amp;quot; to deal with it. Apparently taking him out for a walk and telling him I thought he was hot was the answer to that (I had already come out to him before then). Either way despite being fully aware of my feelings we still had those one-on-one study sessions in his room alone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After most of my finals are done I still haven&amp;#39;t really recovered from the stress and I fuck up. Hard. To avoid dredging up all the  details I&amp;#39;ll summarize: I asked him for nudes. Which was completely out of left field and also breaking the boundaries of a comfortable friendship (at least that&amp;#39;s what I thought, thinking about it after the fact). Although, he responded less extreme than you would think. Instead of freaking out like a normal person probably would he responded with something like &amp;quot;that&amp;#39;s pushing the boundaries of a comfortable friendship just a bit too far.&amp;quot; as though it was only just out of his comfort zone instead of &lt;em&gt;really not okay.&lt;/em&gt; Either way, after getting his response and realizing what I just did I panic, thinking I just ruined a friendship. I run into him by chance in person shortly after and apologize profusely. Somehow he just brushes it off like it wasn&amp;#39;t a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that, the fall semester ends, me and Tom don&amp;#39;t really hang out over break, but Spring semester is a little different. Turns out Tom failed a few classes and is now behind and I&amp;#39;m ahead, so we don&amp;#39;t have many classes together. I still see him around but we don&amp;#39;t hang out as much as we used to, I attribute this to the fact that we aren&amp;#39;t studying every night for finals and pass it off. But at this point I&amp;#39;ve decided within myself that I need to change something about the way I approach my friendship with Tom so I back off a lot. I stop initiating things with him, I don&amp;#39;t really hang out with him outside of the dorm much anymore and overall I&amp;#39;m being an awful friend because Tom broke things off with his GF over winter break and he probably needed me to be there for him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somehow, as the semester goes on the awkwardness of my earlier fuck up starts to fade and Tom and I are hanging out like normal again. Again, at some point between midterms and finals things start to pick up and then comes brilliant me with fuck up number two. I still have no idea what I was thinking when I did this, but out of the blue a text Tom and ask him how big his dick is&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;somuchcringe.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Again, totally out of left field, maybe not breaking the boundaries of a comfortable friendship but definitely pushing it hard. He responds, clearly not OK with the question and I fuck up again and kind of go off on him &lt;em&gt;for not being OK with telling me how big his dick is&lt;/em&gt;. Like...come on me, what the fuck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I came up with the idea that I wasn&amp;#39;t actually friends with him at all and just hanging out with him in hopes of being able to do...you know I don&amp;#39;t even know what it was that I wanted from him exactly. At this point I make the wrong decision again and decide that I&amp;#39;m just not going to be friends with him because I&amp;#39;m not actually in it for the friendship I&amp;#39;m just in it so I can use him as my own personal eye candy or whatever it is I wanted from him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to Spring semester the next year (aka now), Tom no longer lives on campus and I rarely saw him around before this semester, and now I have a class with him this semester. He sits next to me and acts like there hasn&amp;#39;t been an awkward 10 months of little to no contact between us and starts a conversation like nothing even happened. So I can only assume that despite treating him like actual shit and pushing some crazy boundaries when we were actually hanging out frequently, this guy still wants to treat me as a friend. So this is where I need advice: do you think it would be a bad idea to try to make a proper friendship with Tom now that I don&amp;#39;t have feelings for him? If I do go for it, is it worth trying to reconcile the way I treated him before or just ignore it and try to start clean? At this point I don&amp;#39;t really have any feelings for the guy romantic or sexual, so it would be a genuine just friends type of relationship if I decided to try and fix things. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holy jesus that ended up being so much longer than I thought it would be. This was the first time I really told this story in full to anyone, though. So it&amp;#39;s nice to have it out so I&amp;#39;m not dwelling on it. Also, if you read through my entire wall of text instead of the TL;DR I commend you and also thanks for taking the time to read my life story/rant/novella. &lt;/p&gt;

Everytime I look at him it breaks my heart.  He deserves better than me.  I never told him I loved him, because I'm too scared that he loves me back.  I feel  like I am only going to break his heart one day.

Today I got fired for keeping a secret from work.  I lied the president, who is a very close friend of mine (practically a second mom),  about my criminal conviction I had when I was younger.  It was a stupid thing to do.  She said she still would have hired me if I had told her and had been upfront about it, but she had no choice now that other people had found out about it and she had not known in advance.  She still wants me to come back in a few months, but for now I have to leave the company.  

I lied and fucked up.  I was desperate and ashamed when I was looking for work. I needed money to pay back my student loans and I was scared of being rejected,  instead of trusting her and believing is someone who had always been kind to me, I betrayed her trust.  I kept it hidden all these years because I never knew how to talk about it, how to be honest about it, so I hid it from everyone.  It just ate at me fueling my stress.

I realized I couldn't keep all of this hidden anymore.  I had to tell people that cared about me.  It was unfair to them to hid it.  I told my boyfriend about it today, and he didn't leave me.  He should have.  I don't think I am capable of making him happy.  I am just a fuck up, and he is almost an angel.  For right now I started selling T-shirts online to bring in some money, which is what I did in college.  

Edit:  Thanks for all the support guys.  It means a lot to me.  I am not sure what I am going to do yet.  I loved my job, and I don't want my skill to go to waste.  I am going to have to take some time how to figure it all out.  I spent all this time trying to build walls around my vulnerabilities, and they have all just crumbled.

I've been 'dating' for about 5 years now. But I have never had a boyfriend. I've been on countless dates, most of them seemed like they went well but got fucked over and lied to. Sometimes it did seem it went bad and there was a mutual understanding.

I just don't understand why. I don't come off desperate. Maybe a bit shy but it doesn't last long. My dates usually consist of getting coffee or lunch. I prefer something where we can talk and get to know each other. I usually always offer to pay because I want to be nice. A lot of guys say Oh I had a great time would love to catch up. Yet of course I never hear from them again.

I understand yes some guys are douchebags and you just have to accept it. But come on. I've probably met at least 100 guys and not one of them ended up liking me? And I get its logical to think ""If 100 guys are assholes.. maybe you're the problem"". But I really don't think I'm that bad. I'm funny, really nice, really smart, great hair and style, no 6-pack but I'm not fat either. I'm no super model stud, but I would say I am pretty decent looking. I do have some low self-esteem but that doesn't show. 

Recently was talking to a guy that I really liked, that I had met on Grindr but he has come to my work before. We had talked about my low self esteem and he understood and said it wasn't a big deal and not to worry. Anyway, he ended up bailing on our first date. And any subsequent plans were answered with ""idk"" or just no reply at all. I eventually broke it off saying that maybe i needed more attention than he was willing to give, but in a i understand and that does not make you a bad person way. That maybe we just aren't meant to date. Then he calls me drunk but quickly hung up because I told him he woke me up (though i told him it was no big deal) So I stupidly assumed we were talking again. He ignores me all the next day. So I told him that he shouldnt bother ever trying to communicate with me as I would not reply. He then told me he only called me because he needed a ride.

I found out on instagram that after 2 days of us not talking he immediately had a boyfriend. As in, they had gone on dates and officially got together. Now, stupid me I admit, messaged him saying how quick it was he found someone but nonetheless wished him and his new beau happiness. (And I honestly meant it) I then found out that the whole time he was fucking with me. He never did like me and never would. Thats why he bailed, and thats why he was always ""busy"". He was seeing this other guy. Oh and that he now works at my work and he doesn't want drama since now we'll be coworkers. 

He was the final straw so now I feel conflicted. I don't know what I want, I'm stuck between these 2 ""decisions"".

A) I am just DONE with dating. All guys are fucking assholes, no matter what I do every guy just plays me or ends up not liking me. So clearly it is very impossible that anybody will ever love me. I don't have any friends (not exaggerating) and don't have any reason to believe I can be liked at all. Deleted all apps, and not going to bother even talking to a guy or check him out because I know he wouldn't like me and I don't deserve it. I'm not worthy of love or any sort of relationship, platonic or romantic.

B) The thing about me is I have a VERY bad day and I hate myself and attack myself. But the next day I get over it. Now I'm thinking I should try Grindr or some other form of online dating again and  try to be patient and calm. (I am very impatient) I mean, clearly I am handling dating wrong because it logically doesn't make sense that ALL those guys were the problem and not me. And maybe just MAYBE this time I can control myself and not get attached too quickly. (I tend to approach every guy with a 'this could be my next boyfriend' attitude which I can't control)

I live in a very small town. There's not really a place for me to go and meet other gays. And again I'm not sure I want to.

I know this gets posted constantly. I know you guys are done hearing this whiny bullshit. But I just don't know what to do.. I always feel like it'd be easier to kill myself. But I know that I could NEVER do that even if I 100% wanted to. So I am not at all needing advice on that because I guarantee I won't do that.

I had generally had decent luck with Craigslist since I am in a very large city that also gets lots of business traffic. Found a post from someone that was coming to town for a couple of nights and was looking for some discrete fun. I liked that he stated ""safe only,"" ""must meet in hotel bar first,"" and described himself as an ""educated twink."" I replied, he emailed back with his number, and we texted, exchanged G-rated pics, and then spoke. He sounded a LOT younger than his posted age of 25 but he assured me that he was definitely legal. He identified as a versatile bottom, and I describe myself as mainly a top. I went to his hotel that next night and met him at the hotel bar. He was even cuter and younger-looking than in the selfie he sent me, but it was definitely him. He got carded, which he said always happens (FYI y'all - he really was 25). We seemed to have some chemistry, so after one drink each, we went up to his room. The room was small but very nice. Three unopened condoms and a bottle of lube were conspicuously out on a bedside table, which I took to be a good sign. He suggested that we take a shower together, which we did. We tumbled into bed and he took charge in a power-bottom kind of way (I like that). He rode my face for a long time and then said that he really needed to ride my cock. No problem. He reached over to the bedside table for lube and started lubing himself up (quickly achieving several fingers at once). While still on my back, I reached over for a condom, but before I could even tear open the foil he had impaled himself on me and I was balls-deep in him in no time flat. While I certainly knew better, I let him keep riding me expertly. He knew exactly how to work it. I started to jack him off but he moved my hand away and said that he would come ""later."" Right then, his ""only purpose"" (I think that's how he phrased it) was to be my ""little cum dump."" So, I obliged. Afterward, he was still rock-hard and asked me sheepishly if I would still be up for helping him out and he pointed at his erection. I assumed he wanted me to blow him. I assured him that I would help him out, just wanted to clean up a little first and recover from that awesome fuck. He seemed happy that I had a good time. We went into the bathroom to clean up, and at one point he came up behind me and started grinding and poking. He asked (more like begged and pleaded) if he could ""do the same"" to me. I had not really planned at all to bottom that night, but he was just so damn cute, and that teen-sounding voice of his was turning me on in a really twisted way, and that hard-on of his was just so persistent - and thankfully only average in size. So, I said OK, but asked if I could lie face-down on the bed since I found other positions to be not-so-great on the few occasions that I bottom. He was very enthusiastic about this position, stating that it was his favorite way to top somebody. I guess ""versatile bottom"" has different meainings to different people, as does, apparently, ""safe only""? We hit the sheets again with me lying on my stomach. He was very gentle and took his time, and was soon able to work up to an increasing pace. It was then that it dawned on me that he was likely barebacking me. I glanced over at the bedside table: the three condom packets appeared unopened. I asked something to the effect of ""Hey, are you wearing a condom?"" His response was along the lines of, ""No, I didn't think you wanted me to? This feels sooooo awesome."" I know that I should have paused things right then, but instead said, ""Yeah, this feels great!"" which was certainly true. He thanked me and kept right on until he achieved his goal. The sound he made when he came was so hot. He laid on top of my back for several minutes afterward, mumbling about how good that had felt and how many days it had been since he had gotten off. The feeling of his heart pounding and gradually slowing against my back was quite a turn on. I cleaned up without saying much. I did ask him, however, why he posted ""safe only"" on CL when he was clearly into bareback. He casually replied that he does that to ""screen out"" people, figuring that guys that are looking for safe only are negative. He commented that he puts condoms out so that the option is there, but that most of the guys he is with don't seem to want them once he makes it apparent that he's open (yes, bad pun noted) to barebacking. He asked if we could meet up again when he was back in town in a few months. I said sure, as my ""What have I just done?"" panic was starting to kick in. For those of you that have worked yourselves up into your own panic about me… chill. I went to my PCP the next day, got put on PEP, and have tested negative twice now (at 3 and 6 months after the events described). I am so relieved to have dodged a potential bullet. Today, out of the blue I received a text from you-know-who stating that he will be back in town at the end of this month and asking if we could hook up again. I was feeling confident that I would now be better able to negotiate a safe encounter, or that maybe he had learned the error of his (our) ways, or that maybe he had forgotten we went bareback, so I replied ""Sure!"" He texted that he would be in touch with a couple of dates. I was feeling OK about things until his follow-up email: ""So cool that you don't have any bareback hangups!"" Do I just bail at this point? Ignore or block any future texts? Anyone have any tried-and-tested pointers about negotiating a safer experience in light of the history that he and I already have?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;﻿A bit over 6 months ago I was in the mood for a hookup with a new twenty-something.

He commented that he puts condoms out so that the option is there, but that most of the guys he is with don&amp;#39;t seem to want them once he makes it apparent that he&amp;#39;s open (yes, bad pun noted) to barebacking. He asked if we could meet up again when he was back in town in a few months. I said sure, as my &amp;quot;What have I just done?&amp;quot; panic was starting to kick in. For those of you that have worked yourselves up into your own panic about me… chill. I went to my PCP the next day, got put on PEP, and have tested negative twice now (at 3 and 6 months after the events described). I am so relieved to have dodged a potential bullet. Today, out of the blue I received a text from you-know-who stating that he will be back in town at the end of this month and asking if we could hook up again. I was feeling confident that I would now be better able to negotiate a safe encounter, or that maybe he had learned the error of his (our) ways, or that maybe he had forgotten we went bareback, so I replied &amp;quot;Sure!&amp;quot; He texted that he would be in touch with a couple of dates. I was feeling OK about things until his follow-up email: &amp;quot;So cool that you don&amp;#39;t have any bareback hangups!&amp;quot; Do I just bail at this point? Ignore or block any future texts? Anyone have any tried-and-tested pointers about negotiating a safer experience in light of the history that he and I already have?&lt;/p&gt;

I never thought my life to be worthy of a reddit post, yet here I am - I finally made an account to be able to ask you all for help.

So I'm really good friends with this guy and I really like him. He's not said a word about his sexual orientation, but I confessed that I like him - we don't keep secrets with each other. He said, ""I figured,"" and I told him I was ok with being friends if that's all that would happen. His answer was really cryptic - ""I prefer friendships, *last time* a friendship went too far and things got awkward"". (*Inside story, the emphasis on ""last time"" was five years ago when had a girlfriend when he was 14*). All my friends agree that the response they expected from a straight guy would be along the lines of *dude I'm flattered but just don't lean that way* etc. etc. so they're all confused like me. So begins the confusion.

He's since travelled back home for a month and essentially our contact has gone from 50 messages a day to 5 snaps in 3 weeks. Meanwhile, I see he's actively liking other friends' instagram posts and facebook statuses, he sees my snaps, but never likes mine or responds as actively as before. By now you're all probably thinking ""just drop this dude and move on"". He's deliberately spacing himself from me - I know for a fact he's not at all busy at home, so he can't use that as a valid excuse. Asking around, he's apparently cut all communication with everyone we mututally know - to the extent that people have turned to *me* asking what's going on, but I dunno either.

So as a friend, I got concerned over the change in frequency of messages and asked him what the fuck was going on. He responded promptly (despite a 5-h time difference) that he was ""just exhausted"" and apologised. Since then he's asked me *otherwise how's life?* (twice) and *what have you been up to?*, along with random comments like *let me know how that event goes*. Nada about what he's doing.

He confuses me. I'm fine being a friend with him - he's awesome, and while I could dream about us being together, I hold no delusions that it likely won't end up that way. I'm also both sad and pissed that a friend would distance themselves, so I asked him what's up in a don't-bullshit-me-tone. Now he's acting all super-strange, ignoring me yet also sending me (for lack of a better word) 'privileged' snaps/messages - in the sense that I'm the only one who he's messaged.

My interpretation is that he's really confused about something, but I honestly don't know. My friends think he's trying to come to terms with his sexuality, as they think he likes me. While I'd be over the moon if that was the case, I'd rather be there as a friend right now to help him deal with whatever is going on in his head. But I'm not sure how to interpret him/his actions. He comes home in a week, and I'm not sure what to do now.

None of my straight friends know, and NONE of my high school friends (Even my best friend) know. By and large, I'm assumed ""straight"" based on my physical appearance and my voice.

But that's not the issue.

Being closeted is probably the greatest source of my anxiety as (I've begun to notice) I try not to act ""too gay"" (as stupid as that sounds), and am intentionally ambiguous about who I date or what I'm attracted to.

But anyway, I need to tell family and friends but don't know who to trust. I feel like if my parents knew, I could gradually come out to more people more easily, but my dad's a homophobe who always ""corrected"", via suggestion, my more feminine mannerisms as a child, and my mom's a nervous wreck about 90% of the time, so there's no telling how she'd react.

But, I feel like a coward, and I feel I'm missing out on life. I'm jealous of guys who are out and proud who can calmly and directly talk about guys, dating, and so on with friends, family, even on Facebook.

I want that. And, considering that I'm about to graduate from college, I hate that I've deprived myself of that.

What's complicating things is that, as I've mentioned to some of you before, my dad's been helping to cover my living costs while in college, to keep my from NEEDING a job. So, I'm unemployed. And, to a degree, I owe my father some money.

What's worse is that I'm going to likely be moving in with my dad for a few months after I graduate until I can save enough to move out to the city in the fall. This was planned, and this is just how things are right now.

But, being in the closet hurts, and it's kind of lonely. I'm lying to everybody I know and love, and I've subdued my emotions to most everyone around me.

So, what I ask for is advice; maybe even a little bit of support for finding a solution to this situation.

However, I was given another option to get a steroid injection treatment which can make the pain go away for a period of time (It could be months or years). Now, I&amp;#39;m only 23 years old, I&amp;#39;m way too young to have a fucked up back. I was told by my doctor that spinal disc herniation is quite common and almost everyone will have it sooner or later so the injection treatment is really not necessary but still I&amp;#39;m worried that it&amp;#39;s gonna affect my sex life so I actually consider taking it even though it&amp;#39;s only temporary. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there anyone that suffers the same condition but doesn&amp;#39;t take the treatment? How much does it affect your life? As for those who don&amp;#39;t have it, what would you do if you were in my position?&lt;/p&gt;
