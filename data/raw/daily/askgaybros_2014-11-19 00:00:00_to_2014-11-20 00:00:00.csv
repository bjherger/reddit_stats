This time last year I was in a relationship on the verge of collapse. Three months ago I began a new relationship, yet I still find myself thinking about the guy I broke up with last year, probably more than I should.

The new guy I'm seeing is great: he has his life together and is generally a really solid person, and I enjoy being with him a lot. But I feel as though I'm not being fair to him, as if I'm somehow cheating on him in my head. I know I still love my ex, though not to the extent that I'd want anything more to do with him. I'm just not the sort of person to cut people out of my life completely.

Does this make any sense? Am I being dishonest with the new guy?

In light of that, I want to ask for some feedback /advice. Here's the story and my dilemma.

I'm in a committed relationship of nearly 6 years. Since year 2 we have been more or less financially bound together, although we have separate checking accounts. Recently we met with a financial planner and wrote living wills, opened ROTH IRAs, and took out life insurance and disability insurance policies. Generally we share expenses. We also own 2 vehicles and a home together. We both have great credit (775+ each) and low debt (except my student loans). I have always thought we are both financially responsible. I am 26, he is 35. We have had our issues over the years of course, but tonight I found out something that just totally shattered my trust in the relationship.

I bought my husband a new phone for a belated birthday gift. His grandma got very sick on his birthday so he didn't get to have the party I had planned for him. So as a sort of consolation for his birthday I bought him a brand new phone from Google that is pretty incredible (the new Nexus 6 phone - and boy is he in looooove lol). Selling his old phone made the cost very small, so it was a good buy for a birthday gift.

We were on the couch tonight and he asked me to set up his Google Wallet app. I went in to set it up and upon checking into the account, I saw some of his recent activity on the Google Play store as it was clearly displayed right on the front page of the app. I saw these various charges for $50 pretty regularly for the past few months for in-app purchases. The last charge was mid-October, and no activity since then.

I asked him what this was about and he said he plays a game on his phone and has been spending money on the game with in-app purchases. I pointed out that the charges exceeded $300 in just 2.5 months time, and he said he didn't realize it was so much, but that at some point he did know it was a problem and he stopped spending money on the game as a result.

I agree that he has stopped, as his billing activity shows nothing since October, and yet it just makes me question everything. He never said anything to me about this beforehand and tonight he mentioned that he knew it was wrong but he did it anyway.

I have been struggling in my business since graduate school and he has been the bread winner. He says he spent the money because he felt like he wasn't getting any recognition or credit for floating us the last few years (financially). I understand, but this secrecy, though not done with malicious intent, is a total trust violation. I can't get feelings of betrayal, resentment, mistrust, and anger out of my head.

I quickly got a boyfriend and we dated for about 2 years. Then I had a 3 month break before getting into my next long term relationship for about a year and a half. That was followed by an even smaller gap between the next boyfriend, that I dated for 7 months.

I decided after that to spend some time being single to figure out what I wanted and who I was.

After a little less than a year, I attempted to seriously re-enter the dating world, but I realized, I have no idea what I'm doing. My last relationships just sort of happened naturally without trying too hard. I don't really know how to ""do"" the beginning parts of relationships. Unless I'm in the long-term phase where we see each other mostly daily and do stuff like watch TV, cook dinner, or attempt to put together an IKEA desk, I'm totally lost.

I signed up for OKCupid and I've gone on a lot of dates over the last year or so. Most of them just don't work out because of their, my, or mutual disinterest, but the few that have gone really well are where I get screwed up.

Once I actually start seeing real potential in someone, I suddenly become a nervous wreck. I'm constantly worried how it's going, and if it's going badly. I don't know how often I should be texting them, if I'm asking to hang out too little or too much, what to do on dates, etc.
I know if I could just keep cool and stay myself, things would probably just work themselves out naturally like they used to. I just don't know how to bridge the gap from first couple dates to actual dating and that causes anxiety.
