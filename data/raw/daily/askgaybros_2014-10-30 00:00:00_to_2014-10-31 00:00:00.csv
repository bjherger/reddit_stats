If you want to be there and are then, by all means, more power to you! I'm just seeking advice for me and I don't perceive myself as I perceive other people.

I recently started college and that opened a big range of possibilities. Big city, my own room, all that jazz. I was promising myself that I will get more into gay life, although I am only out to my lose friends. The thought of Grindr and Scruff crossed my mind. I have installed these apps before, but just for window shopping and immediatelly deleted them afterwards. The horny me would sometimes like to try them out, but the rational me really doesn't. Here is why:

1) I am EXTREMELY paranoid about diseases, especially STDs. And I seriously mean that - if I had a bf, I would ask him to go get tested with me even if he was a virgin. I know it's crazy but I just wouldn't be calm otherwise.

2) It seems like a really good way to get yourself raped or abducted. Have I mentioned that I'm paranoid? 

3) I'm still a virgin and losing my virginity this way just doesn't seem right. Again, not trying to insult anyone, please, do not take it personally, that is just how I would see myself.

4) It would make me feel like a slut, and not in a good way. I live in a country which is not conservative by nature, but where casual sex isn't really ""a thing"" yet.

But it seems I'm the only one hqving these thoughts. I only met a couple of other gays who want LTRs but even they have some fun like this when currently single. Would it be too conservative to just limit my sex life to relationships? Does anyone here have a similiar issue?

**#1**: I've often seen the saying ""do not search love, love come to you"", but what is the fine line between ""searching"" and actually wanting a relationship and being on dating websites? I'm not on any app anymore (I've been in the past), but I wouldn't mind having someone or some dates, but this saying of ""not searching"" often comes back in my mind and I'm having trouble drawing the line.

**#2**: This one is a question that might ask for longer answers. It happens quite often on Facebook that I find some friend's friends attractive, and when I go on their profile (as a curious lonely guy as myself), I find out that they have many friends from Grindr... From different cities (in my area there's like three main 'city/region'). In other words, these guys have friends from all three regions, many from Grindr. I don't know personally any of those guys, but I've seen their profile randomly there and there and I'm able to recognize most of them... And when I see all kind of ""you're hot stud!"" comments on the cute guy's profile picture, it just turns me off instantly, like a deal breaker.
I mean, I'm fully aware that the gay community can be small and people tend to form group of gay friends etc, but I can't help but feel turned off when a guy has many friends I recognize from Grindr from many different areas. My insecure self also tend to just flee away, and it's not the first time it happens. 

At this point I just don't know if I'm the issue or if it's just odd to have such a gigantic friend list of random grindr people where they all know each other?...

Anyway.. I always thought he seemed really cool and followed him on instagram/ watched videos he posted and thought he was really funny. 

So he opens the door and I'm smiling and going in for a hug to greet him and he's just giving me this blank stare... I felt so unwelcome and uncomfortable. I was happy to meet him I had all these expectations about what he was going to be like... and then he was nothing like I had expected, (which that is a whole discussion in itself).

So we talk a little ask how are you, small talk, not 10 seconds into meeting he proceeds to talk shit about the backpack I'm wearing, like ""what kind of grown adult wears a backpack"" .. sorry I like to carry things around with me? 

He was just being so condescending, barely cracking a smile and kept giving me these weird looks when I would joke about something. We did end up watching a movie, but then I just told him i should probably go and I left. 

But i was thinking about it a lot cuz I feel like from him first opening the door I already felt uncomfortable. I don't think I realized how much a smile really does. I know I've always loved it when a guy has a really cheeky smile cuz it makes me smile really big too... 

i think subconsciously if I'm greeting someone and smiling, and they aren't I just take it as a rejection, I'm not happy to see you, I don't like you. Even though that may not be how they're feeling at all.

I really doubt every person I've met greeted me with a smile, I think maybe it was the fact that we ""knew"" each other and were finally meeting that I felt how I did.

It’s a story some of you might find interesting.  I’m very confused and hope maybe someone here can offer a better explanation than I can.

I visited NYC for the first time ever, staying with a gaybro I met on this subreddit.   My time in NYC was typical rural boy tourist fare.  It was during the drive home that something totally unexpected happened.  I was getting the typical grindr traffic typical of cross country travel.  I drive across the country a lot for work and am very accustomed to the grindr dialogs that happen as a result.   I never initiate while traveling but even so plenty of guys say approach.  Typically Ill respond to everyone.  I wont stop for hookups but I have made friends and cultivated dialogs with guys I might be interested in.  

Anyway less than an hour from home I received an unusual message.  “I love you”.  Now I have gotten lots of brazen hookup solicitations, first ever received grindr message was “wanna fuck”.  I have also gotten plenty of very pleady begging.  This was new.  I wasn’t sure what to make of the comment.  Maybe they were just really liked my eyes and the comment was a over the top yet polite indication of interest or maybe it was a crazy person who thinks they fall in love with everyone.  I didn’t know.  I replied by asking by asking if they started every conversation on grindr with “I love you”.  He replied  “No, I only love you (then he addressed me by my first name)”.     

Since my grindr profile gives my first name, knowing this wasn’t odd, but addressing me so formally was strange.  He said he had loved me for “a lifetime”.  

At this point I started to think this guy was just some crazy person.  There profile pic didn’t look familiar and I had no previous chat history with them.  When I asked how he knew me, I indicated he knew me in collage.  This is where I started getting confused.  He knew where I went to collage and what my major was.  I’ve been out of school for over 5 years now.  I live and work over a thousand road miles away from where I grew up and attended school.  Nothing on my grindr profile gives any indication where I grew up, where I went to school or what my major was.  This guy then went on to say that he had secretly crushed on my all through collage.  I asked his name and he provided a first name only.  I honestly have no memory of a person by that name fitting his description.  However my school was large enough that it is very possible there could be individuals I would not currently remember. 

I contacted a few old collage friends with the same major and they said they had vague memories but had very little certainty.  When I told this person that I had no memory of them they replied “ouch”.  They asked to talk on skype and then said they had to go to a meeting.  During this pause in the dialog I arrived home and began attempting to ascertain if this identity existed.  They returned and I began asking specific questions.  I asked if we had any classes together, to which they said yes.  Then I asked what year they finished, and specifically what classes and professors we were in together.  My curiosity was getting the better of me and I said I would talk to them on skype.  At that point, I was blocked by the user.  

So there is a lot in this event that doesn’t add up to me.  For one the grindr proximity indicator placed this guy 450 miles away from me.  Part of the reason I am posting this is that I am not super familiar how this proximity indicator works.  Typically I have found it works well.  I can scroll through my message history and see clusters in places where I have spent time.  I can see distances increase or decrease as I move around.  I realize there are ways to hide your distance (in which case it would not indicated 450 miles) and ways to “throw off” your location so by indicating you are a mile or two from where you actually are.   

I don’t understand how this person could even send me a message.  This happened in the northeast.  A 450 mile radius from my location would include 10s of millions of people and thousands open thousands  grindr profiles.  As far as I am aware a person hundreds of miles away is never going to be able to locate your profile.  There is no way to “search” for a specific person, all you can do (again to my knowledge) is scroll through profiles based on their proximity to you.  Every possibility I play out in  my mind runs into issues that seem to preclude what happened even being possible.  However I may be missing something so I’m posting here hoping maybe someone can offer a perspective I’m overlooking.  

Possability 1:  This persons story is true.  They had a secret crush on my in collage and are just now connecting with me.   If this is true I never spoke to this person.  I have a fairly good memory and can usually recall specific details about interactions I have had with people, going all the way back to early childhood.  That said if I never talk to a person or interact with them they fade pretty quickly.  I know it is possible for a person to remotely become smitten with someone.  It’s happened to me a few times (in both directions) that I am aware of and I suspect its happened without my knowledge.   Even if such a crush is possible I don’t see how this guy would have been able to contact me on grindr.  Other social media sites leave a much more traceable footprint.  The obvious place to look would have been facebook.  The obvious time to try and initiate contact would have been during collage or immediately after.   

Since that time I have left the area completely.  Trying to find my on grindr would be like trying to find a needle in a field full of haystacks and not knowing which haystack to examine.  How can a person who is 450 miles away even initiate a grindr discussion?  Is it possible to throw off the proximity indicator that far?  If he was actually nearby, how did he find me?  The distance between where I was when he contacted and where I live is heavily populated .  Could he have just happened to be along my rout?  This first possibility seems very unlikely to me especially initiating a conversation “cold” ie without a previous chat history, at such a distance.  As far as I know you cannot hunt down a profile in that way, and nobody in collage would even know what to look for.  

I was not out to anybody on collage and never did or tried anything with anybody (seriously not even once).  I don’t see how a collage acquaintance could know I was gay and thus know to look for me on grindr, and even if they did, I cannot understand how it would be possible for them to find me there. 

Possability 2: The story is bullshit and this person doesn’t know me from school.  This possibility has the same proximity problems as the first.  Why would a random person hundreds of miles away decide to claim to be a collage admirer, and how could they make contact from so far away on grindr?  One possibility that occurs to me Is the star or favorite feature.  I don’t ever use this function, but is it possible to “star” a profile without ever talking to them and then later initiating contact even if they are far away?  Perhaps this person saw my profile, favorited it, and waited until I was long gone to initiate a conversation.  Im not sure this is possible, but even if it is, the sequence seems strange.  Also if it was a stranger, how did they know any details about my university experience?  

Nothing in our short dialog or on my profile gives any indication that I even went to collage, let alone what my major was.  There is nothing that even infers that type of information.  

Possability 3:  I am the focus of some hoax or prank that is elaborate enough that I cannot understand how it is possible or what could motivate it.  My past isn’t a secret.  There are plenty of people who know the level of detail this person relayed.  I can’t image why any of them would feel the need to pose as a smitten collage crush.   Nor can I explain how anybody I have interacted with would have the wherewithal to perpetrate a hoax/prank like this.   It seems like a lot of effort to go through for no payoff.  If they wanted to scare me, they could have threatened a lot more, or used more details.  Instead the dialog was terminated before it did much more than confuse me.  The sudden abortion of the dialog seems like either  this was a lover who having felt spurned by the lack of reciprocation (indeed I didn’t even know he existed), or a hoaxer who did not have enough specific information to keep up the deception when I started asking more specific questions.  

I don’t know what happened.  Its very confusing and every explanation I can think of has glaring problems with it.  Im posting hoping somebody here might have a better explanation.  


","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had a bizarre experience the other day that I cannot explain.  It’s a story some of you might find interesting.  I’m very confused and hope maybe someone here can offer a better explanation than I can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I visited NYC for the first time ever, staying with a gaybro I met on this subreddit.   My time in NYC was typical rural boy tourist fare.  It was during the drive home that something totally unexpected happened.  I was getting the typical grindr traffic typical of cross country travel.  I drive across the country a lot for work and am very accustomed to the grindr dialogs that happen as a result.   I never initiate while traveling but even so plenty of guys say approach.  Typically Ill respond to everyone.  I wont stop for hookups but I have made friends and cultivated dialogs with guys I might be interested in.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway less than an hour from home I received an unusual message.  “I love you”.  Now I have gotten lots of brazen hookup solicitations, first ever received grindr message was “wanna fuck”.  I have also gotten plenty of very pleady begging.  This was new.  I wasn’t sure what to make of the comment.  Maybe they were just really liked my eyes and the comment was a over the top yet polite indication of interest or maybe it was a crazy person who thinks they fall in love with everyone.  I didn’t know.  I replied by asking by asking if they started every conversation on grindr with “I love you”.  He replied  “No, I only love you (then he addressed me by my first name)”.     &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since my grindr profile gives my first name, knowing this wasn’t odd, but addressing me so formally was strange.  He said he had loved me for “a lifetime”.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I started to think this guy was just some crazy person.  There profile pic didn’t look familiar and I had no previous chat history with them.  When I asked how he knew me, I indicated he knew me in collage.  This is where I started getting confused.  He knew where I went to collage and what my major was.  I’ve been out of school for over 5 years now.  I live and work over a thousand road miles away from where I grew up and attended school.  Nothing on my grindr profile gives any indication where I grew up, where I went to school or what my major was.  This guy then went on to say that he had secretly crushed on my all through collage.  I asked his name and he provided a first name only.  I honestly have no memory of a person by that name fitting his description.  However my school was large enough that it is very possible there could be individuals I would not currently remember. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I contacted a few old collage friends with the same major and they said they had vague memories but had very little certainty.  When I told this person that I had no memory of them they replied “ouch”.  They asked to talk on skype and then said they had to go to a meeting.  During this pause in the dialog I arrived home and began attempting to ascertain if this identity existed.  They returned and I began asking specific questions.  I asked if we had any classes together, to which they said yes.  Then I asked what year they finished, and specifically what classes and professors we were in together.  My curiosity was getting the better of me and I said I would talk to them on skype.  At that point, I was blocked by the user.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there is a lot in this event that doesn’t add up to me.  For one the grindr proximity indicator placed this guy 450 miles away from me.  Part of the reason I am posting this is that I am not super familiar how this proximity indicator works.  Typically I have found it works well.  I can scroll through my message history and see clusters in places where I have spent time.  I can see distances increase or decrease as I move around.  I realize there are ways to hide your distance (in which case it would not indicated 450 miles) and ways to “throw off” your location so by indicating you are a mile or two from where you actually are.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t understand how this person could even send me a message.  This happened in the northeast.  A 450 mile radius from my location would include 10s of millions of people and thousands open thousands  grindr profiles.  As far as I am aware a person hundreds of miles away is never going to be able to locate your profile.  There is no way to “search” for a specific person, all you can do (again to my knowledge) is scroll through profiles based on their proximity to you.  Every possibility I play out in  my mind runs into issues that seem to preclude what happened even being possible.  However I may be missing something so I’m posting here hoping maybe someone can offer a perspective I’m overlooking.  &lt;/p&gt;

Basically I am trying to date this guy and he has a boyfriend. The guy is amazingly beautiful, he has beautiful piercing eyes and his face is all in amazing proportion (he has a slightly larger nose but his strong jawline evens it out) and he’s slim which I normally don’t go for but he’s just a 10/10 or maybe 9.5 because of the slightly big nose (just being honest).

His boyfriend is like I say a chunky 30 year old bear (the guy I want is 21, so this guy is creepy to be dating him anyway)… Everyone says they are a really bad couple, some guys even told me the big guy has messed him about a couple of times and even hit him, yet he stays with him?

I basically have tried every technique in the book to get this guy but he just won’t cave in (I am good looking, I have an amazing body) He hasn’t seen my body yet which might help?? Haha

So basically he’s dating an ugly old guy that probably beats him up when I am basically saying hey dude come be my boyfriend and he’s just like not even interested.

I know I sound arrogant and all the bad stuff but that’s just the way I come across I am a nice guy (a bit shallow) but I would love him and protect him I would never hit him or hurt him in any way.
