I'll try and keep it short sweet and simple. 

To give a bit of a backstory, I knew I was gay from the age of 13 or so. At that age, I became friends with a guy we'll call M. I was head over heels in love with him for most of my teenage years and it made me depressed, made me do a lot of stupid things and over time destroyed the good friendship we had. 

He wasn't gay and from what I remember wasn't great at handling the way I felt about him and combined with a ton of other messy situations we just ended up falling out after the age of 17/18 or so and never speaking again. There wasn't any real spectacular fallout from what I remember but we were both just not really compatible as friends anymore. I never really forgot about him though and I still think about him every now and then. When we were friends we got on really well and bounced off one another, and if I regret one thing in life it was always that I let things happen the way they did and missed out on someone I really cared about and was an amazing person. 

Anyway, to the meat and bones. It's now 7-8 years later and I was visiting people out of town and checked Grindr and I saw his picture. That moment I felt sick, and anxious and just had a whole mixed bag of feelings. I contemplated what to do and decided to message him. I kinda wish I hadn't because he looked fucking hot and we ended up talking for a couple of hours about how we were getting on, touching on the things that made us drift apart but generally having good conversation. After a while he had to leave to go see someone but he gave me his number and said I was free to keep in touch, and now I don't know. Seeing him on there was an intense feeling, and talking with him made me remember how great he was, I apologised for the way I behaved way back when and he said it wasn't a problem. We both live about 2 hours away from eachother and I visit his city once or twice a year so I said next time I'm there I'll try an grab him. I'm not pursuing anything romantic at all I just would love to meet up, grab a drink and laugh and talk like we used to. Should I keep in touch via text if he gave me his number? I think I'm a bit paranoid he was just being polite. I really don't know what to do with myself. I've been thinking about it non stop and it keeps making my stomach knot.

So, it's been almost a week since I posted asking for help, and some of you guys gave great advice, so I thought I should provide an update… Anyway, here it is…

I met up with my ex-boyfriend today to really talk about what happened between us the other day, and I'm not sure what to make of it… He tried to kiss me twice the last time we met up, and said that he made a mistake in breaking up with me. 

I'm leaving for basic training on Tuesday morning. Well, when we met up he said that the past week has been quite hard for him knowing that I'll be leaving and won't be back in Sydney for almost 3 months. He said that he still wants to be with me and reiterated that he made a mistake in breaking up with me (he broke up with me because of my decision to sign up). 

He started crying saying that he didn't want me to go, because he will miss me so much. He continued by saying that he's fallen for me all over again, and said that he loves me. He also said that he's went on dates with other guys who weren't like me, and going on dates with them made him realise how much he still wants to be with me (not tooting my own horn). 

I knew he cared about me, but not to the extent that he described… He told me that he loves me, which is a massive step in any relationship/friendship and I was taken aback a bit. He's such a beautiful person, and I knew what I was going to say would ultimately crush him. 

I told him that I didn't have any romantic nor sexual connections with him, and that I don't want to commit to someone who couldn't make up his mind (harsh I know). I let him know that I didn't want to be with someone who would constantly change his mind about our relationship and that I wouldn't know what he would think when I'm actually gone and not being able to contact him for weeks/months on end. I also told him that I value his friendship, and that he changed my life for the better, and that I would forever be thankful to him, but that I can only see him as a friend, and nothing else.

It literally broke his heart, but I know it's what's best for me and for my career path. I don't want to be thinking about my relationship when I'm at basic, or eventually when I'm deployed… He started balling his eyes out, and I comforted him with a hug and told him it was going to be okay. I reiterated to him that it was for the best, and that he deserves someone who can commit to him 100%, and I couldn't promise that even if I tried. 

He begged me to rethink my decision and to give 'us' a shot and that's when I said that there is no 'us', and that he made a decision to break up with me, and that he has to just accept and respect my decision, like I did with his. 

He apologised for ever breaking up with me and that he made a stupid decision that he would regret for a long long time. Now at this point, I'm worried because he has a history of depression and self-harm and his tone and demeanour screamed red flags. I told him again that he deserves happiness and that I would be there for him if he ever needed to talk. I said to him that he may hate me for this, and that was okay but that eventually, he will get over me and love someone else, to which he said that he won't be happy unless he's with me and that he doesn't know if he'll ever love again like he did with me…

My mind is racing at this point, because I was so into him and he was into me aswell, but I stood my ground and believe I made the best decision for me. Anyway, the car-ride home was awkward to say the least with him sobbing the whole way home. When we got to his place, I told him that it's probably the last time he'll see me for a very long time. He started to ball his eyes out again and said that he wants to see me tomorrow and be there on Tuesday when I leave, but I said that it's probably best not to (on his part, not mine). We embraced and he only said 'take care' whilst choking on his tears… and that's it… the silence in my car was almost eyry… 

I can't help but think that maybe I was a little too hard in my delivery considering his mental issues, but I stand by everything that I said and believe it was best for the both of us… So thank you to the guys that commented and sent me mail, I appreciate all your support and guidance. I cannot wait to start a new chapter in my life and do a job that I am going to love. 

Thanks again bros, and thanks for listening again. Take care bros! *internet hugs*","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original post: &lt;a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/30quey/soon_to_be_military_guyhelp_getting_over_an/""&gt;http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/30quey/soon_to_be_military_guyhelp_getting_over_an/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

He started to ball his eyes out again and said that he wants to see me tomorrow and be there on Tuesday when I leave, but I said that it&amp;#39;s probably best not to (on his part, not mine). We embraced and he only said &amp;#39;take care&amp;#39; whilst choking on his tears… and that&amp;#39;s it… the silence in my car was almost eyry… &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t help but think that maybe I was a little too hard in my delivery considering his mental issues, but I stand by everything that I said and believe it was best for the both of us… So thank you to the guys that commented and sent me mail, I appreciate all your support and guidance. I cannot wait to start a new chapter in my life and do a job that I am going to love. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks again bros, and thanks for listening again. Take care bros! &lt;em&gt;internet hugs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

First time posting. I'm known to be a pretty stoic guy, and it's not in my nature to write something like this, so bear with me.  This is a long post and if I ramble, well, it's because I have to get this out.  It's not my intention to whine or tell a sob story with this post; rather, it's just a guy becoming reflective at this point in his life and questioning himself, and seeking advice from others.

I'm a 30 year old guy, gonna be 31 in a couple months. I'm from the mountains of Virginia, and grew up in an area that was a mix of rural area/mountain community and college town, since we have two universities and a community college nearby. I'd venture to say I'm luckier than most from rural areas, since exposure to those two largely different worlds introduced me to a range of people from all walks of life and from all over the political, religious, and ideological spectrums, and as a consequence I was able to both come to terms with my sexuality late in my teens and became more accepting of people and their differences and beliefs.  Growing up, I aimed to become a gentleman and a scholar who isn't afraid to fight in any capacity for what he believes in or for those he loves, to become an honest, intelligent man who will go to bat for his family and friends; I tried to become both educated and yet never lose what I was taught throughout my childhood.  I'm proud of my mountain heritage and what it taught me, yet I realize that remaining near where I grew up and only knowing that area and culture can limit my development as both a person and a man.

Nowadays, in my eyes, I'm not at my full potential of who or what I could be.  Part my own personal feeling, part fact.  I graduated with a B.S. in English in May '11 (with plans to go to grad school after taking a year or so off, which I abandoned/held off on because the area of the job market I aimed for took a nosedive in terms of growth/projected hiring, and besides I don't care to add to the already sizable amount of student loans I'm paying on), and it has opened some doors, but a B.S. or B.A. only carries you so far these days.  I moved with my fella of nearly five years from southwest Virginia to San Antonio, TX last August for him to start a promising new job; I recently got a promotion in my current job but it's not a company I care to continue in for an extended period of time.  At this point in my life I've become more reflective and *finally* started to take stock of my life, my accomplishments, and my relationships with family and friends.  While I have some stuff in all these that I can be proud of, I feel an equal (or near-equal) amount of stuff that, to me, is in a half-assed or outright terrible shape.  

I'm tired of my lack of true confidence in myself, tired of my awkwardness and caring a bit too much at times what people think of me, tired of seeing myself as ""lesser than"" and letting my fear of failure hold me back.  Discipline is one area in which I've faltered often: while I have a good work ethic once I get working and focused, I lose a good bit of that once I'm out of that ""zone"".  I tend to be a terrible dawdler as well, which can throw my entire daily schedule off if I've screwed around and not gotten done what needed doing that day or that week.

Part of what I'm trying to do to fix some of my confidence issues is seeking camaraderie with a group (or, perhaps, *groups*) of guys who are both mentally and physically engaged in their ventures, who are supportive and yet expect me to pull my own weight rather than piggyback on their efforts and work.  I've craved camaraderie since youth, but never have felt I truly belonged, especially once several guys found out I'm into dudes rather than girls.  Many of them have come around once they realize I'm able to pull my own weight, that I'm not effeminate, that I have a sense of humor about myself and can cut up with the best of them.  I've only done some sports in high school (ran track, to be exact), but I was never a standout athlete.  It's only in the last few years that I've become aware of sports teams that cater to gay guys, or (as I prefer) have a mix of gay and straight guys.  If I were to go the sports/athletics route, I'd want a group of guys who understand that I'm coming from a background of little sports experience and are willing to provide pointers at least and training at most so I can be a useful, reliable teammate and bro both on the field and off. 

Hell, I'm even considering joining the military this late in life; partly because I want to become a better man, partly to potentially forge lifetime camaraderie with a group or groups, and partly to carry a sense of pride and accomplishment forward into my later years.  I realize it's kind of an extreme choice at this point, enlisting, but hell, I've heard of some folks who went in late in life (late 20s, early 30s) and they really enjoyed it.  I've had several friends in the military over the years, some of who have recommended it to me, one of whom said they're looking for guys like me with my outlook and honesty.  I wouldn't know, as I've never enlisted.  I had several recruiters knocking on my door in my senior year of high school ('01-'02), but I told them I wasn't their man for it at the time, and I wasn't; I had my head up my ass back then and would have made a terrible soldier or officer.  I know this sounds like an excuse as well, but I also felt I would get one or several of my fellow infantrymen killed if we deployed, and having a brother's (or brothers') death on me was something I didn't want on my conscience then and don't want now, though I've realized since youth that is part of the reality of war, that I may have that baggage to carry with me for the rest of my life if I survive one or several deployments.  

An older, ex-Marine buddy of mine back in Virginia who I've talked to some about all this has been supportive and willing to listen, and suggested I should, if I decide the military isn't for me, seek out a gym, since they have their own groups and level of camaraderie.  I have begun working out again and trying to whip my ass back in shape after years away, so that would be good for my development and desire to transform my mind and body, to become more than what I am now.

Not doing a TL;DR summation here at the end, but I will say this: after all this rambling, all I can ask you guys is your advice on what else might be a good course of action for someone who is searching for himself, who is searching for a way to ""prove himself to himself"". Thoughts or suggestions, please?

Guys have always seemed really standoffish toward me my entire life to my dismay but lately since I'm completely out and more importantly since everyone is finally treating it like it's no big deal and being open about it, they're a lot nicer towards me and more engaging. And I feel like a lot go out of their way to include me. Like this one dude kept looking at me every time he was saying something funny. And another dude kept touching me on the shoulder. And another guy giving me intense but friendly eye contact when talking. Are people overcompensating or are they just friendly in the first place? As far as I can tell they only treat me that way. I've always believed that it grosses people out but I think since I'm comfortable and open, and that my friends openly joke at me all the time about it, it might make other people comfortable too.

All my friends are straight guys as far as I know. When friends of them find out I&amp;#39;m gay, usually because my friends always crack jokes about how I&amp;#39;m a cock expert (smh), they get really friendly and comfortable. Guys have always seemed really standoffish toward me my entire life to my dismay but lately since I&amp;#39;m completely out and more importantly since everyone is finally treating it like it&amp;#39;s no big deal and being open about it, they&amp;#39;re a lot nicer towards me and more engaging. And I feel like a lot go out of their way to include me. Like this one dude kept looking at me every time he was saying something funny. And another dude kept touching me on the shoulder. And another guy giving me intense but friendly eye contact when talking. Are people overcompensating or are they just friendly in the first place? As far as I can tell they only treat me that way. I&amp;#39;ve always believed that it grosses people out but I think since I&amp;#39;m comfortable and open, and that my friends openly joke at me all the time about it, it might make other people comfortable too. Is it because I&amp;#39;m letting myself be vulnerable and real? I&amp;#39;m hoping I unlocked the key to easily making friends here....&lt;/p&gt;

I'm on a path. I got resources. I got a job. I got a family that loves me for me. And I got a whole bunch of faith.

I guess my question for you all is this: how can I remain faith in life? How do you keep on walking even if you hit a rock or bump or even building on the way to your haven? I got faith but it is sometimes hard to keep strong. 

People were right when they told me that it does in fact get better. It got better for me. I am away from all of the school bullies. People around me right now are accepting and loving. But how do I grasp onto that feeling and never let go of it ever?

How should I proceed? I told my best friend I'm having these sexual feelings towards men and he was really nice about it and has offered to take me to a gaybar up in Denver.

I'm struggling as well because my whole world view is being rocked, technically I'm a conservative but I'm beginning to understand things differently now and get why people see the world the way they do.

Best brother ever. 

Our upbringing was very strict and religious, and our parents are very homophobic (my mother once lectured me on the wickedness of gay relationships, to name one instance), but I'm glad he's so accepting.

I'm very inexperienced in being gay (24, 0 experience). 

I have a crush on a professor (Mid 30s) who came in once to give a lecture but he doesn't teach at my institution so it's all fine on that front. 

He is gay, and well very attractive (physically and personality) and it is the first time I have really felt it is time/worth me exploring my sexuality further.  

I have met with him on a professional level once since and so have an open professional line of communication. 

How do I progress this further? I'm not  a very forward guy and he isn't outwardly gay (I found out he is gay via Google stalking - yes I know but haven't we all at some point?)

Anyway I saw the old quote that one in ten people are gay. Other studies usually put the number at 2% at most, there is a big difference there. That's not even to say what is considered gay, if the Kinsey scale theory is true then that makes this question even more difficult to answer.

But anyway, I feel like I live in a pretty straight washed world. I'm in the suburbs, so that doesn't help, but for example in my high school class of over 300 only one was known to be gay, another came out as a lesbian years later. Many more I just don't know either way, so I wouldn't say that's it because I don't know them in depth, but this gives the perception of almost everyone straight.

Or like I just went to the gym. There are two brothers there in their older 40s, seem like twins, if seen in isolation I'd totally say they are gay, but they were there with their sons (all very hot at that). So while I still question if maybe there aren't 100% straight, they are at least ""straight enough"" to have  fallen in love, gotten married, had kids, and while I don't know the whole story it's definitely not fair to think they are anything but straight.

So I mean that's what I mean. Meanwhile I pretty well versed in the M4M grindr and tinder scene, and I keep recognizing the same guys over and over. Sure some hide behind blank profile, various ones might project a straight persona publicly and date girls while hiding in the closet, and not all gays are on grindr by a long shot, but you would think if the % of gays is higher than we thought, where are they? I like in the Northeast so it's not a super  conservative area anyway. Yes, the number of gays is near impossible to gauge because of the closet and the likely larger than expected who live gay but don't broadcast it. I know it's all subjective, but what % of guys do you think are totally or predominantly gay? 

**tl;Dr**- Some surveys claim up to 10% of guys are gay, but I'm not seeing evidence of this in my subjective experience. It's not that I  believe or want the claims of it only being 1-2% to be true, but I'm wondering where are they then?!  I feel like gaybros here would have some input from their own experiences what they think about the different claims that either 1-2% or 10% of guys are gay, or have an idea of their own based on their subjective experience.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I realize this question is impossible to answer and totally fluid, and has probably been tackled here before, but I feel like there is a carousel of people who come through here at different times so why not try again?&lt;/p&gt;

Many more I just don&amp;#39;t know either way, so I wouldn&amp;#39;t say that&amp;#39;s it because I don&amp;#39;t know them in depth, but this gives the perception of almost everyone straight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or like I just went to the gym. There are two brothers there in their older 40s, seem like twins, if seen in isolation I&amp;#39;d totally say they are gay, but they were there with their sons (all very hot at that). So while I still question if maybe there aren&amp;#39;t 100% straight, they are at least &amp;quot;straight enough&amp;quot; to have  fallen in love, gotten married, had kids, and while I don&amp;#39;t know the whole story it&amp;#39;s definitely not fair to think they are anything but straight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I mean that&amp;#39;s what I mean. Meanwhile I pretty well versed in the M4M grindr and tinder scene, and I keep recognizing the same guys over and over. Sure some hide behind blank profile, various ones might project a straight persona publicly and date girls while hiding in the closet, and not all gays are on grindr by a long shot, but you would think if the % of gays is higher than we thought, where are they? I like in the Northeast so it&amp;#39;s not a super  conservative area anyway. Yes, the number of gays is near impossible to gauge because of the closet and the likely larger than expected who live gay but don&amp;#39;t broadcast it. I know it&amp;#39;s all subjective, but what % of guys do you think are totally or predominantly gay? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;Dr&lt;/strong&gt;- Some surveys claim up to 10% of guys are gay, but I&amp;#39;m not seeing evidence of this in my subjective experience. It&amp;#39;s not that I  believe or want the claims of it only being 1-2% to be true, but I&amp;#39;m wondering where are they then?!  I feel like gaybros here would have some input from their own experiences what they think about the different claims that either 1-2% or 10% of guys are gay, or have an idea of their own based on their subjective experience.&lt;/p&gt;

Last summer I have broken up with my last boyfriend after a long struggle to make the relationship work out. The struggle was on my part only, and I should have been wiser earlier and have seen that it leads nowhere. After him dumping me several times I finally accepted the fact that I cannot do this alone. Weekend after, I went out to party with my friends. Crazily drunk, I met a guy at about 6 am. Nothing really happened, I was barely standing straight anyways.

Next day, he found me on Facebook. Next week we went on a day. Right from the start I decided I do not want to rush into a relationship right now, because all my relationship started within weeks of knowing one another.

Months came and went, we were meeting on a weekly basis, sleeping, kissing, sometimes having sex. I was constantly telling him not to get attached cos it won't turn into a relationship and I don't want to hurt him. The truth? That was the first time that sometimes courted me instead of me fighting to be with someone, I guess. I just did not know how to behave.

During that time, I arranged a number of dates, but I either canceled them or just gave up before the end of the first one.

Last week, I told him I loved him. I realized I was subconsciously waiting for a better offer, while this one was the best. But is seems the promotion was over. His answer was that he does not want me any more, does not feel a thing, do not really find me attractive any more etc. He told me that it changed on the last weeks because he started actually thinking about it.

I've been a total mess ever since. I know a week is not a long time, but the problem I have in life (or a blessing, really?) is that only love problems move me. Work, studies, family, health: all those things upset me at times, but generally I am really level-headed and I solve those issues without shaking all day, crying all evening and waking up all night. It's only with romantic feelings that I lose it all.

To make it worse, I actually, with tears in my eyes, asked him to give me a chance and try. He said OK, immediately telling me that he does not believe it will work out anyways as he does not want to be with me and does not feel a thing. Since then we've been meeting every other day. He kisses me, he holds me while we are sleeping, he squeezes my hand through sleep... And still, constantly, repeats that he does not want this and it won't work. That there is not a slightest chance for that.

Does him meeting me like this means that deep down, he might think it might work, but does not want to admit it so I won't get too happy too fast? Or am I just being delusional and it has no future since he only does that not to see my cry?

I am grateful to be able to tell someone about that, I hope it reaches someone who could share some wisdom...
