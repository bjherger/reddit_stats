My relationship is great, we both love, care, and are committed to each other. Sexually...of course it's not like it was during the first 6 months to a year into the relationship but it is not dead; from what I understand that's a pretty common thing for most people.


I'd like to know - based on your personal experiences - the pros and cons of having an opened relationship; all the good, the bad and the ugly.
I know all couples have different set of rules such as: playing together, playing separate, 3 ways only, etc etc.

I am not a fan of 3 ways (especially if it includes the presence my partner)...also my experience in that have been very limited and it was years ago prior my relationship however I don't rule them out. 

I am also concerned about really liking to play outside the relationship, make it a regular thing...then my relationship with my BF goes down the kitchen sink...

I dunno...I'd like to hear from people who have been in this situation and maybe by reading some of your comments the whole thing will be easier for me to approach.

He says he's clean and I want to believe him, but I imagine he has been with a lot more guys than I have (because he is exclusively gay while I am bi and have only done oral with four other guys) and has at least one other current semi-regular sexual partner that I know about.

This is a throwaway for reasons that may become obvious later. If you have any other questions for me please let me know and I'll respond. I would love for you guys to help me figure this stuff out or answer some questions I have. This is my first time ever on this subreddit, so I hope this is something that is okay to post here. First I'll start with some background:

Ever since I can remember I've been attracted to guys and girls physically. I've always resented my feelings towards guys because that was always portrayed as something that was wrong and sinful. This is one of the first things that made me resent myself. When I was a freshman in high school, I was raped by one of the other guys in my singing group. He raped me because he thought that I was cute and I could be gay, so I must want him too. This was far from the truth, and it sent me into a spiraling depression and put me even further into self resentment. A couple other things happened, but you get the point. Now, being almost 5 years after the rape, I have come to terms with the fact that I am attracted to men and I shouldn't resent myself for it, I just don't really know how attracted I am to them. The idea of being with another man both excites me and scares me away. I think that kissing a guy and cuddling with a guy that I was super attracted to and just having them there is the hottest thing ever. I think that dicks great.   The idea of helping another guy get off is so arousing and appealing to me. I however, hate the idea of sticking my penis up someone else's butt, being penetrated by a penis, or sucking someone else's penis. This might be partially due to a bit of residual self resentment for these feelings towards other men. All of this brings me to another point: I would love to find a man. To try it out or maybe find some man just to cuddle with and maybe kiss. someone to take it slow with and find out if I really am gay or bisexual or whatever I am. Is there a way I can find someone like that? 

Looking further ahead, the idea of being gay or bisexual scares me. I was raised in a catholic home and always taught that this was the wrong thing to do. My family would most likely disown me or talk to me with great distain. They might even try to send me to one of those ""pray the gay away"" camps. I couldn't handle that. Also with my friends, I know I have friends that would still accept me for who I am, but I am scared that the way that they treat me will change or some aspect of our relationship will change. I don't want it to. I just want to have the ability to be who I want to with everything else staying the same, but I can't see that as an outcome and that scares me.

sorry this post was so long guys. I really appriciate any help you can give or any personal stories, advice, etc.

tl;dr
always been attracted to both boys and girls. Raped by guy friend in high school. sent in to spiraling depression. Questioned what it means to be attracted to guys. Love the idea of being with a guy entirely except for blowjobs and butt sex. Afraid that if I were gay my family would disown me and friends relationships wouldnt be the same as they are. just overall afraid and wondering if I can find someone to help me figure this out.

Main questions for you guys:
How can I find someone who would not pressure me into doing things with them, but would let me explore my curiousities?
How do I know what time would be a good time to come out of the closet if I do have to some day?

&lt;p&gt;sorry this post was so long guys. I really appriciate any help you can give or any personal stories, advice, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tl;dr
always been attracted to both boys and girls. Raped by guy friend in high school. sent in to spiraling depression. Questioned what it means to be attracted to guys. Love the idea of being with a guy entirely except for blowjobs and butt sex. Afraid that if I were gay my family would disown me and friends relationships wouldnt be the same as they are. just overall afraid and wondering if I can find someone to help me figure this out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Main questions for you guys:
How can I find someone who would not pressure me into doing things with them, but would let me explore my curiousities?
How do I know what time would be a good time to come out of the closet if I do have to some day?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for all your support. Sorry if this was too long or if this isn&amp;#39;t the subreddit for this, it was the only place I could think of to get quality advice.&lt;/p&gt;

Feel free to provide me with suggestions or advice on anything in the following situation.

A few weeks ago, a guy from Grindr and I started chatting and texting one another.  I  felt things went pretty well.  He seemed to like my sense of humor and I appreciated that he wasn't just another sex-crazed jerk, but was rather willing to have an intellectual conversation as well as give into corny jokes.  

We decided to hangout at a coffee shop, which was our first time actually meeting.  Again, I thought things went fairly well.  Though I rarely actually meet people from apps and sites like Grindr, if I do the first time hanging out usually lasts about an hour.  We were at the coffee shop for a little over two hours and there was literally very little nervousness or unnecessary silent, awkward pauses.  Some important things that I think I should note I learned from our conversations:  He is extremely involved in social groups through his major as well as his current job and therefore is pretty busy, he is much more social than I am but he seemed pretty understanding and nonjudgmental of my introverted ways, and he is much more adventurous than I but again I thought he seemed understanding and even inviting of me if I wanted to join sometime.  Eventually, he had to go so we parted.  I'm a little weary that I made a few mistakes at this point.  First of all, I wasn't really sure what to do as we were parting ways, so I awkwardly shook his hand and thanked him for hanging out.  I knew that was weird and wrong the moment it was over.   Secondly, I waited until the next day to text him and let him know I enjoyed it and hoped to hangout again; I probably should have done this in person before we parted.  

Anyways, he says we can hangout again and we make plans to go to an outdoor play he's been wanting to see.  Well, the day rolls around and that afternoon he texts me saying he'll be fifteen minutes late.  I responded saying that it was completely fine.  Here is where I made another mistake: I also told him that it was fine if he needed to reschedule.  In saying this, I was trying to be understanding, knowing that he has a pretty busy schedule but I also worry that it could be construed as me not actually wanting to hang out and therefore encouraging him to cancel.  Anyways, he did cancel and said we would reschedule.  So the next day, I texted him my work schedule for the next week and he said he should be able to make something work.  At this point, I started questioning whether he really was interested or wanted to hangout.  I don't know if he actually has or if it's just me being paranoid, but it seems like since then he has been texting me even less and avoiding rescheduling.  I've asked him and he just explains that he's a bad texter, especially when he's busy.  Anyways, I've kind of been telling myself that I'm going to leave it up to him to initiate rescheduling - I feel like if I do, I'm almost being forceful in making him hangout with me.  Plus I felt like telling him I wanted to reschedule when he had to cancel as well as sending him my availability the next day was probably enough.  

It's been a little over a week now, and he hasn't really said anything about rescheduling or hanging out.  We have barely talked at all this week - I texted him last night (Friday) for the first time since Monday morning and it felt like very general chat for a short period of time.  I ended up having a couple of drinks and sending him another text that essentially said that I still wanted to hangout, but if he had lost interest or something I would prefer he just tell me rather than hoping I pickup on ambiguous hints.  

In the end, I know that I've come off as an insecure, clingy baby.  I'm not proud of that.  I also feel like in trying to be understanding of his busy lifestyle, I may have come off as uninterested myself but I'm not sure that's the case.  What should I do?  Give up?  I really hate to give up, because this is the first guy I actually feel there could be something there.  I just don't know if he does.  Am I picking up on the hints that I should be or am I just being paranoid?  I just need some perspective on what other people see happening in this situation.
