Not sure on his level of comfort with gay people etc. as we haven't know each other for that long. I know that he has said to mutual friends that he thinks I'm a top bloke and loves hanging out with me etc. Also snapchats mates the usual bromance stuff like 'drinks with my boy' etc

Last night I was with a special guy friend and we were messing around. I have a small fetish for sexual frustration and teasing so I had him push all my major buttons (kissing my neck/chest, teasing my ass, ect..) all of this without me being able to touch myself.

He kept this up for nearly 2 hours and what happened  as a result to this was the most amazing/frightening thing I've ever experienced.

He did all of it with such intensity that after that long I started to convulse and moan uncontrollably. My face, hands, and upper body started to tingle painfully. My vision pretty much seemed like it was stuck on zoom when I opened my eyes. I felt as if I was cumming and had this pulsing pleasure sensation on my ass hole.

So, my backstory here is that I'm a 21 year old college student and I came to terms with the fact that I'm gay and came out around November. Never had a girlfriend before or any of that (although, I'm not a virgin at this point... that's a different story). However, all this is to say that I'm not sure what I'm doing in terms of dating. In fact, I'm starting to feel like I probably should've started hooking up and having my ""slutty phase.""

Fast forward a bit to about 3 weeks ago, and I met this absolutely incredible guy on Tinder. He's incredibly nice, funny, smart, and just a really great guy. He's also 33. That's not the point. I'm fine with this. I like older guys. The thing I'm worried about here is the fact that he lives almost 100 miles away. Normally I'd just talk and not expect anything, but he's great to talk to and he seems genuinely interested in me. He says he'll visit regularly and whatnot. Cool. He also seems to be at one of those sort of transitional periods in his life, where he's holding onto an easy job just for security, which, while not exactly the same as where I am in life puts him in a sort of compatible range, I suppose? You know what I mean? Basically, I don't feel like the different points in life argument of age differences is a huge issue. However, it is still one of the factors that could at some point come up. I'm young and not finished with school, and I'm scared to settle just yet. I'm also scared of getting that dirty feeling for doing things without him and whatnot. I'm in college and I've been doing me for 2.5 years, and I'm not exactly ready to just quit that, ya know? I don't mean sleeping around and stuff, but if I wanna go to a bar or a concert, I just sort of feel guilty and stuff.

Well, his greatest flaw his huge lack of confidence and self-esteem. He has no reason to feel that way. He has a doctorate and has done a shit ton of stuff and overcame immense odds to get where he is. He insists he's hideous, and I insist his lack of confidence is what makes him that way. He gets playful sometimes and sends me some cute-ass pictures. He's not bad looking, and the fact that he as a person is so fantastic makes him all the more attractive to me.

So, here's the next problem. Over the past few days, he's gotten quite mopey and keeps downing himself. I encourage him and it ends up turning into frustration on my part that he isn't listening. I just don't feel like his constant downing himself is fair to me or him. He's great. Well, today he finally came out to tell me that he's bipolar. This terrifies me. 

We still haven't met, and we're not technically together, but it definitely feels like it's getting serious. However, I'm scared. This would be my first relationship (and I think his, too). Apparently most folks bail on him when he admits that, so I don't blame him for holding it back. But I'm a supportive person, and the distance makes me being supportive difficult. He sort of shuts me (and everyone else) out when he gets in one of his moods. I want to help him, but I don't know how. 

I'm a firm believer in loving yourself before you can love anyone else, but I'm not sure he loves himself enough to be a lover, as much as I want to see him be able to do that. I'm not sure what else to say. Ask away. I get a little forgetful in trying to explain big stuff like this. It's a little overwhelming. I'm basically looking for advice, experience, anything you can offer.

You know what I mean? Basically, I don&amp;#39;t feel like the different points in life argument of age differences is a huge issue. However, it is still one of the factors that could at some point come up. I&amp;#39;m young and not finished with school, and I&amp;#39;m scared to settle just yet. I&amp;#39;m also scared of getting that dirty feeling for doing things without him and whatnot. I&amp;#39;m in college and I&amp;#39;ve been doing me for 2.5 years, and I&amp;#39;m not exactly ready to just quit that, ya know? I don&amp;#39;t mean sleeping around and stuff, but if I wanna go to a bar or a concert, I just sort of feel guilty and stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, his greatest flaw his huge lack of confidence and self-esteem. He has no reason to feel that way. He has a doctorate and has done a shit ton of stuff and overcame immense odds to get where he is. He insists he&amp;#39;s hideous, and I insist his lack of confidence is what makes him that way. He gets playful sometimes and sends me some cute-ass pictures. He&amp;#39;s not bad looking, and the fact that he as a person is so fantastic makes him all the more attractive to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, here&amp;#39;s the next problem. Over the past few days, he&amp;#39;s gotten quite mopey and keeps downing himself. I encourage him and it ends up turning into frustration on my part that he isn&amp;#39;t listening. I just don&amp;#39;t feel like his constant downing himself is fair to me or him. He&amp;#39;s great. Well, today he finally came out to tell me that he&amp;#39;s bipolar. This terrifies me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We still haven&amp;#39;t met, and we&amp;#39;re not technically together, but it definitely feels like it&amp;#39;s getting serious. However, I&amp;#39;m scared. This would be my first relationship (and I think his, too). Apparently most folks bail on him when he admits that, so I don&amp;#39;t blame him for holding it back. But I&amp;#39;m a supportive person, and the distance makes me being supportive difficult. He sort of shuts me (and everyone else) out when he gets in one of his moods. I want to help him, but I don&amp;#39;t know how. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a firm believer in loving yourself before you can love anyone else, but I&amp;#39;m not sure he loves himself enough to be a lover, as much as I want to see him be able to do that. I&amp;#39;m not sure what else to say. Ask away. I get a little forgetful in trying to explain big stuff like this. It&amp;#39;s a little overwhelming. I&amp;#39;m basically looking for advice, experience, anything you can offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tl;dr: talking with an older bipolar guy living 100 miles away. Like him a lot, could get serious, not sure how to proceed or if I even should.&lt;/p&gt;

In need of some feedback from my fave peeps. 

I'm planning on going to Chicago (from the UK) for a few months to visit Second City, take some improv/ comedy classes. Kind of missed out on travelling before uni and becoming a professional writer is a tough gig, so I thought I'd save up, take some time out and just go for it- do what you love, etc...

I'm making my budget now and I was wondering if you could think of anything else that might need covering? Any rough estimates on how much things cost? Never done this before- I'm all for fun and spontaneity, but I love me a good solid plan.


So far I've got accommodation, cost of classes, food, plane tickets, a few hundred labelled ""extra"" (maybe for tickets or fun or whatever), a wad for emergencies... Thing is, it's all seeming affordable with what I'm earning at my crappy office job, so I'm only assuming that I'm missing something, right?


Anything else? I know it's a vague question, but if you've been travelling or stayed somewhere abroad for a while, what do you think you overlooked?

I met a guy recently (really great guy), we went on two dates, and the second date ended with him staying overnight at my place. We had really great sex, multiple times, but even more so, we were extremely cuddly and intimate. We talked about date 3, which we just had last night. As usual we had a nice night, followed by a lot of intimacy. I told him that I was really starting to like him quite a bit, and then he said he needed to ""talk to me"".

He didn't say anything dramatic, only that he was also dating two other guys at the moment, and that I was pushing him just a bit much. I apologised, he apologised, it got really awkward, we talked a lot, but clearly all the fun was instantly gone. I felt like I was now competing with these two other guys, he felt that he'd led me on accidentally. (I should add that we met on okcupid, and although I understand that he could be dating a few guys at once, personally I don't understand why he'd not mentioned earlier that he was seeing a few guys at once.)

He left a little while later. I said I was ""ok"" with things, but after thinking it over for an hour or so, realized that this just wasn't going to fly for me. In the current situation I was just going to be constantly waiting for him to tell me if I was in or out. That just struck me as deeply depressing.  So I called him and told him this. I also said ""look, I don't want to be a dick about this, but I guess in a way what I'm saying is that if you want to date, it's really just going to have to be me at one time.. I can't do this multiple partners thing."" He said he needed a few days to think it all over, and apologised again for putting me in a tough position.

I really don't know if what I did was right or not..? He wondered aloud if maybe he just should have kept his mouth shut. I wonder too, I dunno. He did say that in a strange sense it was *because* he though I had potential as a partner that he thought he should be honest with me about all this.

Any thoughts on my situation? Was I too assertive? Have I doomed it? Should I have just sat back and waited? I really like this guy and I'm very confused. I don't want to prolong a bad ending, that is the worst feeling in the world.

**Edit/Update:** Thanks for all the thoughts so far guys. I did some thinking this morning and it kind of slapped me in the face that as much as I did speak my mind and was 'truthful' to this guy, I wasn't being entirely fair to him. I texted to communicate as much to him, and have essentially backed off a bit, saying that we should just let things develop naturally if they are going to develop. Now I probably look inconsistent, but I'm trying to be good guy. Jeez, no friggin' rule book here... I'm sure there's more to come. What is so difficult is that balance between speaking your mind and being respectful of someone else's mind... wow! Tough one.

It seems petty and juvenile when I think about the situation. But I wrapped my feelings all up in the gears out of care for a guy and now his gears have continued turning. It's crushing me.

James and John have been seeing each other for seven years, since they were 15. They have almost everything in common now, and untangling their lives from each other would be a difficult thing at this point. Now enters Matthew. Matthew starts seeing James, even though James is still with John. This goes on for four months, the whole time Matthew is complaining that James should break up with John because cheating is bad and he doesn't really want to be a part of a situation where he is encouraging it.

After four months, (two weeks ago almost exactly) Matthew gives up. He says that James is a bad person for continuing to promise that he will someday break up with John. He stops seeing James. Here enters our protagonist, me. I meet Matthew. Things go really well. He is honest about his previous situation. I take that as a good thing. Things move quickly, which is rare for me. We kiss at midnight. I catch feelings. We lay next to each other that night and he says ""I have a feeling that some day I'll say I love you"". I am happy. It's been a while since I've been happy.

Monday of this week rolls around. James sees a picture from the New Years party. This prompts him to feel like he's missed out on something good. He contacts Matthew, says he is going to break up with John by Thursday, aka two days ago. Matthew talks to me. Says he is confused. I don't understand- everything he has said about this guy seems to be rotten and manipulative and it hurts me that this is something he's considering. I take the nice route, not trying to convince him but asking questions, like ""He only finally broke up with John after you broke contact with him, what does that say about a relationship with him if the only way he'll do the right thing is by taking such drastic measures?"". 

You can guess the result. I cry for the first time in nine years. He doesn't understand what he's done. He's 17, James john and I are 22. My friends say I told you so. I have several times in the past thought ""None of these guys I meet are making me feel anything. Is there something wrong with me?"" And then the one time I let my feelings go, this is what happens. I was less distraught when my first boyfriend broke up with me. This one hurts.

For context, I'm 19, pretty damn thin and am doing (well, trying to do) StrongLifts 5x5. I've never been an active person, at all, so adapting has been difficult. I'd post this in /r/fitness, but... I prefer the crowd here, to be honest.

So it's been about a year now since I signed up for the gym and, quite frankly, I'm getting pissed off at my lack of progress. I guess I should't really be surprised... I mean, I don't eat enough, I don't sleep enough, my form isn't great and my workouts are inconsistent. I've pretty much completely dropped cardio to focus on getting my weights nice and solid, but even at levels that are so much lighter than most I see around, I still falter. I've gained maybe 2KG this year, have a _bit_ more muscle definition... though my lifts have obviously improved since I started, these things are incredible minuscule compared to the progress I see around me.   

To put this in perspective: after a year of being in the gym - and about 8 months of having a bit more of an idea for what I'm doing - my bench is at 35KG. Still. 3-fucking-5. And my form is terrible. I can't keep my arms steady for shit and just the other week I minor-ly injured my shoulder because I let the bar stray a bit too far forward. And at the moment I'm now having to take a break from squats because I've done something to a muscle in my groin area. And it's been like that all year. Random aches and pains deter and distract me, and I take it all the harder when I have to take another break. This time was supposed to be my 'good' run. I took a break for about 2 months later last year because I got so [demoralised](http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/2d0arg/rant_a_low_moment/) (among other things). 

So my stats are:

Bench: 35KG

Squat: 60KG

Deadlift: 55KG

OHP: 30KG

BB Row: 30KG

Which aren't good at all, really. I've read some people on /r/fitness say they fucking started out higher than this.

I guess I know what I need to do. Start counting calories, start eating 3 meals per day instead of 1, et cetera et cetera. Thing is, even the few meals I actually do like - I just plain don't like eating (or cooking, for that matter). My appetite is atrocious to the point where I can go a whole day without eating. And considering I'm moving out of home in less than a month, this point is really concerning me. I guess I've kind of built it up in my head to be a huge ordeal (counting calories, finding recipes I like that suit my nutritional targets, being able to actually cook said recipes...) and that if I can't do it effortlessly and perfectly, then I can't do it at all. It's a hard attitude to describe, it's a mix of perfectionism, frugality, laziness and apathy. 

Not to mention there's just so much shit to consider... like which specific recipe of which meal will I like, if I can alter a recipe to suit me or if it'll just fuck everything up, which recipe is better value for money, which uses ingredients that are easily accessible and that I know how to cook, which uses cooking utensils I have access to, whether I should worry about eating breakfast and whether that should be a solid or a liquid or a fruit or a cereal, or if I should try for intermittent fasting (and finding out wtf intermittent fasting is and why it's necessary)... To make things harder, I'm (99% sure I'm) lactose intolerant. It's just frustrating as fuck. All that for something I wouldn't even do given the choice. Eating just shouldn't be this difficult. Neither should sleeping. I get it into my head that if I have such a hard time getting these extremely basic things right, then, well... I'm sure you can imagine the rest. 

I've read the /r/fitness FAQ / wiki more times than I can count. I'm subscribed to four cooking subs and I've spent hours upon hours searching for recipes I might like. And yet I still just can't bring myself to care enough to give it 100% in practice. I'm lucky to cook once per week, let alone try a new recipe.  

To be struggling with all this bullshit, as well as some mental health issues and my persistent skin issues is just really wearing me down. I took a gap year last year to sort all this shit out, but all that happened was my mental state worsened and I got complacent. And now I'm moving in a month and trying to be self-dependent and... _sigh_. I don't know whether my whole problem is laziness or depression. Things would be so much easier if I were just normal and healthy. Ugh. But enough self-pity.

So... any insights? I'm sorry it's not a terribly coherent post, but it's late (yay for shitty sleeping patterns) and I'm pissed off. Last time I posted 5 months ago I was in a slightly darker place with the same problems, and all I've managed to do in that time is improve one or two things, make most other things worse and then sweep them under the rug. 

**TL;DR for those who don't want to read through my bullshit:
**
- Lifts are shit, progress is shit

- Eating is shit, don't know where to start

- Sleeping is shit, therefore energy levels are shit. Sleeping patterns are fucked because I go to the gym late because I don't have the confidence to go when other people are there (I know it sounds horribly insecure but, hey, that's me).

- Know what I need to do, generally, but there's so much bullshit to cut through and so much apathy on my part that I just don't know where to start. 

How can I start eating enough when I have such little and inconsistent appetite? Is there an easier way to balance all this stuff? Is there any particular reason why I keep hitting these brick walls (energy and aches/pains wise) at the gym, or is it a result of all this other crap? Is there any way to ease the cooking process to make it simpler and less confronting to dive into? How can I transition from this place of incredible inconsistency to one or organisation?

To be a bit more specific, anyone have any ideas about my groin injury? I'm thinking it's my squat form... apparently I need to push through my heels more, but it seems physically impossible and I always end up driving upwards leaning forwards a bit, which is why I think I'm putting strain on my groin muscle (of course, that could all be bullshit, idk).

I don't really know what I'm hoping to get out of this. I know this is horribly, horribly all over the place, so sorry. Apologies for the length as well.
