Two of the people are close friends of mine and know I'm gay.  Two of the other's think I'm straight as an arrow.  The last, and the one in question, just basically found out today that I'm gay from one of my friends.  (partially at my request, because both my friend and I had questions about his sexuality, all signs point to at least bi but more gay, and I think he's kind of cute, she just happened to be the one working side by side with him this week in their department.)  
 

Anyways, as the night progressed and the guy in question got a little liquored up he started hitting on me, and some of it was quite obvious, almost to the point that one of the two guys that don't know kind of caught on (i'm one of those that doesn't broadcast I'm gay but doesn't hide it either so I'm fine with it).  Example, I stop drinking usually an hour or two before I want to leave, and even then I don't have a ton to drink before that, at one point he it was discussed me being DD and he looked down at my crotch and then up to my face and said he didn't have to work tomorrow.  Anyways I played it off as that I'd be interested but didn't really pursue it mainly because I wasn't sure if it was something he really wanted or if it's just the liquor.  Then when we all got up to leave I asked if he was OK to drive home and he said ""yes"" and then gave me a hug.  The only other hug he gave was to my friend and her husband (as a group hug).  So there's the question, was I stupid for not taking him up on his flirting, or did I play it right and not, just leaving it at a hug?  

 
I know at least one of my friends thinks I should have taken him up on it but my thought process was A) I don't really want someone that has to be drunk to be around me; been there, done that, wasn't great.  and B) if he really wasn't interested but let his guard down because of the liquor Monday (or tomorrow morning) could be kind of awkward.  I'm not saying I wouldn't date him, but I don't think a 1 night stand would be the brightest idea.

TL;DR: Went out with coworkers, one of which was hitting on me heavily but I didn't take him up on it for concern it was just the liquor.  Was that stupid?


Edit: I think I should also point out that he did say to my friend that he wasn't opposed to being with a guy, but just never found the right one.

Edit 2:  Talked to him this morning.  His words say he doesn't remember anything, his body language said otherwise.  I told him if he wanted to hang out as friends then I wouldn't be opposed to the ideas.

I&amp;#39;m not saying I wouldn&amp;#39;t date him, but I don&amp;#39;t think a 1 night stand would be the brightest idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Went out with coworkers, one of which was hitting on me heavily but I didn&amp;#39;t take him up on it for concern it was just the liquor.  Was that stupid?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: I think I should also point out that he did say to my friend that he wasn&amp;#39;t opposed to being with a guy, but just never found the right one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit 2:  Talked to him this morning.  His words say he doesn&amp;#39;t remember anything, his body language said otherwise.  I told him if he wanted to hang out as friends then I wouldn&amp;#39;t be opposed to the ideas.  Tentatively made plans for Sushi in the next week or two (depends on how hung over he is after his halloween party).&lt;/p&gt;

Aside from the age difference we have a lot in common and the last 4 months have been the happiest Ive ever been.

The problem is that I was away out of town for 3 weeks. We had not been official or exclusive, and since I returned he said he's met someone else. I told him how I felt about him, and he said the reason was that he didn't think I wanted anything serious. After a lot of discusion, he then said that he would end it with the new guy.

Fast forward two weeks, and we've had lots of conversations and crying and making up, but he's chosen the other guy - who unbeknown to any of us until right now is an acquiantance of mine.

When we were together he used to say the most loving, kind things, and right up until 2 weeks ago was still calling me babe and sending sweet messages.

I guess, since it's my first realtionship, I wanted to know what you guys thought of the possibility that we'd get back together? Do these things happen? Or is that it? He says he never wants to lose me as a friend, and I don't want to lose him. The other guy is 24.

I've spent all day crying over this. I never thought I'd get so emotional. The worst part is that I know that they spent all weekend together, and have been planning vacations and even met each others friends and families - all stuff we had planned to do but hadn't yet done. Im so sad.

tl;dr: Guy I was casually seeing ended it with me because I didn't tell him how I felt early enough. Is it possible we'll get back together?


UPDATE:
Thank you all for your advice, some of it was difficult to hear but I needed to hear it.
I had coffee with him today, which I shouldn't have done, but since he ended it on he phone I felt like I needed to see him in person one last time. I was an emotional wreck, teary and sad. It was obvious he's already moved on, and spent a lot of time giving ME advice on how to move on, he has obviously lost the emotional connection long ago. His new bf even came to pick him up and I was forced to shake his hand while I looked like I was going to cry, so now I look like a clingy emotional idiot.

We said we'd see how we feel next year if we can hang out as friends. I'd like to, but I'm not ready yet.

I now see him as a fickle 21year old who has intense sincere feelings IN THE MOMENT, but changes his opinions more often than he changes his socks. I wonder how long the new relationship will last.
