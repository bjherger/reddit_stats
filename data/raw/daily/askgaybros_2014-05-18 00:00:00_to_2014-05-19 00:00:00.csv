The day after New Year's 2013 my bf of several months drugged me and cleaned out the house and cash, then took off. No warning. 

Then I lost my job. A week later I was carjacked while moving, lost everything. Literally everything, it was packed in my car. Two weeks after that I wrecked the car I came up with to replace the stolen one. Now I was unable to find a job as I had no transportation, no ID, and no clothes etc. Ended up homeless. 

The saving grace in all this was my current(?) bf. He heard I needed a place, told me to come crash on his couch. We'd never met. 

It was pretty much love at first sight. I dropped a 44oz red slushee on his white carpet, he got sloppy drunk and cried all night... it was a fairy tale beginning. We've been together 9 months and I've never known what it's like to truly love but I do now because of him. 

We couldn't find work this whole time. Not for a lack of trying, but with no transportation in the Midwest we were looked over for most jobs. 

Lost our place two weeks ago, and he moved in with his mom. I wasn't welcome. Like, at all. So we decided I would leave and try to find a nice town with plenty of work where we could settle down and raise a couple cute puppies.

I suggested we open the relationship while I am gone, just to keep it simple. Who knows how long it will take to get settled somewhere. He was **adamant** that we weren't doing that. No way, no how, we have each other and that's enough. I was dubious because I know how horny he gets, but ok, makes me feel better. 

I was gone 4 days before he called crying. He had sucked off some random guy in the back room of a porn shop.

Omg. I felt like I was going to pass out but maintained my calm, asked again if we should open things up. ""No!"" He's just been stressed. Ok... whatever, me too... but I still love him so I forgive him. 

Last night he went out to the club. Then I see all these posts on FB. Nothing bad, just every one is a cute gay boy. I also notice he's ""liked"" every single pic of this guy he used to text constantly, months of pics. He always blew it off when I said it really bothered me how much they talked and how they talked. Excused it by this boy living out of state. 

Well bros, guess who moved back this week. Yep, the boy! The one he's been talking to for months. The one who's adorable. The one who's now there and I'm not. 

I don't see this working. I love him. I know he loves me. But he obviously can't control himself, it took 4 days before a stranger got his dick in him. Like I can believe anything about this guy he knows, especially after hearing ""I never should have told you I cheated!"" when I hadn't ""got over it and dropped it"" 22 hrs later. 

Bros, why is he not letting us open things up if he's wanting to fuck around? Why not break up if you don't want an open relationship but still want to fuck around? Should I even try? I really love him. He's different than the rest. But I'm in another state and this is killing me. What would you do if you really loved the guy? 

Here's the last thing. There's an absolutely adorable guy talking to me here in town. He's made it clear he wants me and he's looking for LTR. If my bf wasnt in the picture I'd be all over that. But I feel like I'm cheating even talking to him. Should I just give it a go knowing my bf is doing the same? 

My guts are twisted, I've felt ill for days. Idk, I just can't think straight at all, help me out, idk with what, just any advice. I have no one to talk to, i know no one here. Just needed to vent. Sorry for length.

Edit* *We just talked, I told him to read this post, and I told him it's either open on both sides with full disclosure or I'm done. He agreed to open the relationship. I'm not happy, since I believe in monogamy, but it's something without losing us totally. Like he said, just because we can doesn't mean we have to. After I get settled where I'm at, we will reevaluate the relationship and see if he wants to move here or if we go on as friends and nothing more.*

One of my closest friends is a beautiful, intelligent, and hilarious girl. Besides our taste in music, we are incredibly compatible. She is becoming increasingly flirty and touchy with me, tonight being the most blatant example thus far - 2 hours of hand-holding, arm grabbing, and head-on-shoulder-resting while we watched a movie with a large group of friends. Now, a part of me enjoyed it - who doesn't love cuddling? Unfortunately, the other part was panicked and anxiety-ridden.

I don't have feelings for her, and I can't, no matter how badly I want to fall for her. Her advances have been going on for a few months, and how I feel hasn't changed. While I'm not certain whether she truly has feelings for me or is just touchy with me (though the whole hand-holding thing suggests more than just a cuddle-buddy right?), it seems like this girl, my friends, and I all want the two of us to become a couple ... but I just ... can't, I'm not wired like that.

It's causing me a lot of internal struggle and pain because ...
1) It shows me that if I were straight, I could be with this gorgeous, compatible, wonderful girl.
2) It reminds me of my internalized homophobia and how badly I want to be straight.
3) It's evidence that this isn't just a phase - any guy would be lucky to be with her. It's forcing me to acknowledge a repressed reality.
4) It makes me want a nice guy to cuddle, hang out, and connect with even more.
5) It pressures me to come out and I'm just not ready yet. I feel like a coward for just submitting to it all.
6) I'm scared my friends will start questioning my detached reactions this girl.

What do I do bros? How do I handle the unwanted intimacy without hurting her or myself? 

I'm going to try and avoid some hang-outs for now and distance myself a bit. However, I can't keep this facade of the naive, unaware guy -my excuse for not reciprocating- forever. I know that the answer would be to come out to her ... but I'm just so incredibly scared, frustratingly hurt, and emotionally unprepared.

Thanks for reading! It's late where I live, so I'll sleep on it for now - writing did help out though.

I suffer from depression (and am on meds and saw a therapist for 4 years but taking a break), but this seems worse than normal.  I am gay and I am out, which I guess is one good thing.  I find myself incredibly unattractive.  I know people say you have to love yourself before anyone will love you; my problem is I am not sure I can love myself.

Not suicidal, but just don't know what the point of going through the motions are.  I keep trying to tell myself it will get better, but honestly I don't know if it will.  I have the sense I'll be alone.  And it's scary.

I guess I am not really asking for advice or anything, but just wanted to share what I am going through.  If you want to share your experience I'd love to hear it; not for advice but just to have a sense of connection to someone.  

Sorry if this is not appropriate venue to say this, but I didn't know where else to let this all out.

I hadn't been laid in quite a few months because I wasn't really in the mood for other people. Then I got chatting to a hot guy on grindr (I had been using it all along, but he seemed different). He was funny and smart and hot and interested in me. A while later he messaged me again and I spontaneously said let's meet up for coffee, so we did, and we ended up having sex. 

Since I hadn't been laid in a while, I was practically skipping the down street on the way home, it was a great release. If that had been the end of it, I wouldn't have been surprised or bothered. But I'm new to the area and he said he wanted to see me again and introduce me to some people. A while later he contacted me again and invited me out to a social gathering. 

I knew it was unlikely that we'd have sex again, because obviously his friends would be there, and things generally don't go that way. I also knew that he had probably been having sex with other people in the meantime, and I had also had sex with someone else. But, at the end of the night, he made out with someone he had just met and went home with them. 

I was crushed. I'm still struggling to just forget about it. I don't even know why, the sex we had was fairly mediocre. I keep going over and over it in my mind and coming up with all these reasons about why it bothers me so much, but I'm not getting over it.

Okay, so about a year ago, I started talking to a guy through growlr. We hit it off almost instantly, however, he lived around 8 hours away from me and he lives in Canada (I'm in the US). So, I didn't really think it would become anything and in a couple days we'd never talk to each other again. But this guy was different, we were both each others' exact types and had so much in common. Naturally we started texting each other and skyping and getting to know each other better. We'd planned to visit one another, but since we're both poor college students, it's difficult. 

Fast forward to now. We've been texting each other almost every single day for a year, never met each other in person, and still really enjoy talking to each other. I'm going to California for the summer and he's all but straight up said he's coming to visit. I'm so excited to meet him and hang out with him in person. I just have a problem.

I REALLY like this guy, like a lot. Though we're not dating or anything even remotely close to it, I feel connected to him on a very real level and it honestly makes me upset if he doesn't text me during the day. He's become one of my best friends and I want to show him a great time if he comes to visit. However, I also want to know where we both stand as far as each other is concerned. Obviously our geographical situations aren't ideal, but idk, I think I'd be very happy with a long distance relationship with him. I guess I want to know if he still feels how he did about me when we first started messaging each other. 

I realize this post is kinda rambly and all over the place, but is there any advice you guys can give me about how to address this with the guy? For obvious reasons, we've taken more of a friend approach to texting, with only subtle things to remind each other that we like each other. I want to tell him how I feel but I also don't want to scare him away because honestly, I've never met someone I've connected with so well before. So yeah, any advice would be appreciated.

That's where the fucking machine comes in...I've only used it three times in the last couple of months (again, not a lot of free time) and the experience has been incredibly intense. The last ""session"" was for about six hours (not continuous, of course) and I came twice. I then had a quicky the next morning and came a third time.
