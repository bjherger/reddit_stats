Most guys here say that they need to get tested for STI's even if theyre in a totally monogamous relationship. 

When I and others have brought up the fact that we can go onto our SO's phones/emails or whatever without asking them people start screaming about privacy and trust issues and all that jazz.  If youre having to get tested in a monogamous relationship it seems counterproductive to not be able to check your SO's phone.  I mean I know theyre two different things.  Your health vs cheating but in the end it comes down to blind trust. 

Id rather have a completely open(not in that way) and honest relationship where there is not even the slightest hint of impropriety.

I'm studying computer science and a company in Austin TX has reached out to me to apply, but I don't know if it's worth my time or not.

 I've grown up in the north east and I've been fortunate enough to never feel ""different"" for being gay. All of the other companies that I've applied to, and one that I've gotten an offer from, are located in New England or are on the west coast. 

My question is, what is it like in Austin? I can't really ask the tech company what it's like for gay guys. Would I experience prejudice for the first time? Or, is Austin really liberal and it'll be just like living back home? 

Thanks for your responses!

So... for the last month I have been dating a guy... A really hot guy that turns me on in so many ways and he seems to get turned on by me too... But we have a problem... 

I've been the top so far and that's more than fine for me (and seems that for him too) but the problem is that he's from a ""old fashioned"" (let's called that way) country/city so he likes to bottom but he's kinda repressed so each time that I have sex with him he is like off and doesn't look to into it... 

But he is hot, objectively hotter than me and if he wants to find another guy he can find it easily so if he still dating me he likes me... Besides I speak with him and I have noticed that he is kinda repressed and that he doesn't deal very well with the fact that he's gay.

So, guys of reddit... Do you have any advice about how to help a guy to be less repressed? How can I help him to feel good with the fact that he likes to bottom in a subtle way?

Surprisingly he says that he's gay (so he isn't in the ""bi"" phase) and he go some times to gay parties so the biggest repression problem that he has is about sex... He doesn't like to show that he is enjoying bottoming even if i know he does...

So I'm currently stomping through the misty and intimidating territory of my first long-term relationship. I'm 21, and although I've had a couple of flings and several dates, it is this guy I have finally overcome the hurdle of reciprocating ""I love you"" etc. For various reasons this was a big step, but one which showed great promise

Unfortunately, the relationship is semi-long-distance as I study at University a couple of counties away. We saw each other every 2-3 weeks from the end of the Summer vacation. Oral sex aplenty on these weekends, but we only had anal sex once when he came up for my birthday (I bottom). He pushed for it, enjoyed it then.

Since then he has shown decreasing interest in sex. I wanted to have a repeat of the anal episode, but he was disinterested. This is cool, I don't mind someone having preference for oral. But we haven't done it since.

I'm now back for Christmas for a good 5 weeks, which I see him maybe 3-4 times in between his work. He's shown very little sex drive and I worry I have done something wrong. Even to the point when he invited me over to stay at his dad's house when he was home alone - you don't get many opportunities like that! When i confronted him about it (kindly obviously) he just stated he was happy with cuddling and didn't see the need.

Maybe we're just differently matched, but it seems so different to the randy sod I quite enjoyed at the beginning. Still love him, but this conversation just gets awkward to bring up. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good day,&lt;/p&gt;

3 weeks ago I got a positive Elisa test result. 
Then I got a negative Western blot. 
Almost a week after that I got a negative p24 antigen test. 

I was told I was most likely negative but to repeat the western blot to be sure in 3 weeks. So I did. 

It came back today indeterminate.

Where does that leave me?? 

In the intervening time I've still had this virus, going on 6 weeks now with week 3 being the acute period where I was bed ridden. 

My doctor ran heaps of bloods and it came back postage for low grade hepatitis. I'm immune to b so we're waiting on second day tests to determine a or c. 

So there's definitely something going on. 

Could hepatitis be screwing with the Western blot? Or should I start preparing myself for a positive result, and assume this is the window period? Should I get a follow up p24 antigen done? 

The infectious diseases clinic rang after the Elisa and said they would have done a full viral load test but for the p24 coming back negative, they even decided I was now low risk and probably a false postive. 

How does this new indeterminate change things? 

Man I'm so I've this and need some advice :(

I'm 17 (almost 18) and live in a really small town in Ireland. Population of around 3000, everybody know's everybody. Yeah, it sucks. I am in my final year of school and have big exams coming up in June. Leaving Cert, for those who are familiar with it.

I moved to Dublin this summer, had a part time job and was staying with my aunt. Life was so good. I had been texting this guy (same age as me) who I met on twitter and then we met up. After a few weeks of us going out to each other, he asked me to be his boyfriend. I knew I would have to move home at the end of summer but I didn't care, I really liked him and he really liked me so I said yes. We had the best summer ever together and spent most of our time with each other. Keep in my mind my family don't know i'm gay at this stage, only my close friends.

After summer we broke up for three weeks but we both hated it and came to a conclusion. Despite the distance, we WOULD make this work. That was August, it's no December and we're still together. I have gone to see him a couple of times and told my parents I was going to stay with my friends who I met over the summer etc.

Anyways, yesterday I decided to tell my mother I was gay. She told me she already knew, and had known for years. She cried and said as long as I was happy she didn't care. She told me she loved me. My dad was even better, he hugged me for the first time in so long and also cried, which I hadn't seen him do ever. 

Today, they sat me down and told me they think I should wait until summer to come out fully (facebook, people at school, cousins, etc). I don't understand them and they clearly don't understand me. They told me they want me to focus on my studies and that this relationship is a distraction. They said me coming out will have consequences on the whole family. They said my sister may not take it well (she's a year young than me). They said I could become a target for bullying at school, which will also affect my studies. I can kind of see where they are coming from with the studies thing, but the rest I feel is just to hide the fact that they don't other people to know yet. They told me they know they cannot make me do anything, but they really want me to do things their way.

It really bothers me because, the main reason I told them was so I could come out to everybody. I don't care about being a target for bullying, I know nobody will bully me in a heavy way, and anybody who says shit to me about being a faggot etc, well that's a major problem that they have, which they should try to solve. I mean it's 2014, yknow. Also, I really want them to meet my boyfriend. I want him to be able to come down and stay at our house, and I want to go and stay with him. I love him alot and although it is about it, it's mostly about that fact that i've spent the last few years hiding who I truly am, and I am really tired of doing that anymore.

What do you guys think I should do?

I've not been diagnosed with BDD, and I'm not saying I necessarily have it, but it's very similar to a problem I have. I'm a fairly skinny guy. I'm 5'11"" and weigh 147 lbs, so my BMI is normal. I don't have a ton of muscle, but neither do I have a ton of fat and at times, especially when I stretch a little, you can see my ribs.

However, whenever I look in the mirror, all I ever see is fat. I'm not forcing myself to under eat, and I don't purge so I don't have an eating disorder. But over a period of sixth months, I lost 20-30 pounds while gaining about an inch in height. I think I may be unconsciously forcing myself to eat less, and I feel much more guilty if I ever overeat, which I haven't done in a long time. Also, at times, whenever I'm feeling full, even if I've just drunk a lot of water, I'll feel this overwhelming urge to go walk on the treadmill or do some sort of exercise. I've had friends tell me, whenever I said I shouldn't over eat, that I'm ""too skinny"" to be watching my weight.

My mom is worried about my weight loss, and I haven't told her that it might be because of a mental disorder because I don't want to worry her further. I'm thinking of maybe talking to psychologist or something whenever I go to college about it, just to see if I actually have BDD.

I also tend to look at myself in the mirror a lot, which I know is a sign of BDD, and I like pulling my shirts in such a way, that it accentuates how thin my waste has become, but it always feels like it isn't enough. I think the worst it's ever hit me was when I realized that when discussing anorexia and bulimia in AP psychology, I was actually considering what a good idea they may be.

I'm a 16 year old closeted gay guy.  I really feel as if my standards are too high right now.  I don't find a lot of men very attractive at all.

I'm really just not a fan of androgynous features like super sharp jawlines and high cheekbones, stuff like that.

I was thinking about coming out but I realized shortly afterwards; it really wouldn't make a difference to me right now, because I simply don't find many people my age or even a bit older than me attractive.  The worst part is, I wouldn't consider myself that attractive which makes me feel like the men I actually like are out of my league.

I have this friend, we will call him Andrew. He and I are really good friends. He is the type of guy that you may assume is gay; however he has never stated that.

Andrew and I communicate a lot using FB and I’ve noticed the last few weeks the bar that pops up on FB saying “people you may know, 1 mutual friend” has been a lot of gay guys half naked, the mutual friend for them all is Andrew. 

Now this doesn’t bother me at all, however if Andrew is still in the closet then I’m sure he doesn’t want me or anyone else to know! 

I went to his friends list and noticed he has it blocked (obviously he doesn’t want others to see who he’s friends with).

 My question is this. What do I do? If I can see it, then I know others he is friends with can see it as well, and if he isn’t ready to come out then I’m not ready for him to either. 

Should I tell him, should I show him what I see and what other may see as well? Should I leave it alone? I want to tell him, however I don’t want to mess him up emotionally. Coming out as gay is life changing and I would never want to hurt him in any way. 

Also is this a glitch with FB? I would assume that if you had your friends blocked then it shouldn’t show anything to anyone.

We went on a few dates, hung out a lot, and then had sex. About a week later, we made it official and essentially spent every moment together when we both either weren't at work or school. We lived ten mins away from each other, He worked full time and I'm a full time student with two part time jobs. We spent every night together since we had made it official, and he even said ""I love you"" three weeks in. I said it back, because I really did feel it. I know its extremely cliche, but I seriously thought I had found the one. We had so much in common, we liked the same things, our relationship was on fire, and I was the happiest I had ever been. Fast forward two weeks.

He got extremely distant. The sex stopped, he didn't really want to hold my hand or any of the other cute coupley stuff anymore, and the communication broke. From the beginning, we had told each other everything. Our past, when one of us was jealous, any issue that came up we talked about it then and there but all of the sudden that stopped. He closed up and I was very confused and hurt. 

We had a serious talk about this about a week after he disconnected. I come to find out that his ex (his first love) had texted him apologizing for what had happened between them (nine months ago) and that he just wanted to make things right. We talked about how that made me feel and how the distance wasn't helping the relationship, and he agreed to stop communication with his ex because all it did was bring up feelings of sadness, insecurity, and hurt. (His ex had cheated on him and felt him without really an explanation.) Things were okay for a few days, and then the distance happened again. His ex texted him. Looking back, He had blocked his number when the first incident happened and told me that he was texting him off someone elses phone, but he really just unblocked his number. We tried to talk about it again, we just need up arguing and he said he needed closure from it and that he didn't have feelings for him, he loved me, and that the only feelings he had were sadness and anger. We agreed to work on things because we both felt very strongly about one another and what we did have before was great. 

We go out last weekend and he gets sloppy drunk. On the way home, we were talking about how he got mad when I talked to someone I knew from school who was at the club and he ends up calling me his exes name during the conversation. I asked him why, he said he didn't know, it just slipped out, but that he was sorry and really drunk. I drove him home, he asks me to stay with him and to talk about the night, and he ends up spilling that he had been texting him for a while and that he just really wanted closure because he didn't want to lose this. He fell asleep and I checked his phone. There were texts to him saying tell me how much you care about me and that ""I care about you so much"" and that he couldn't stop thinking about him. I was essentially done with the relationship at that point, I felt so hurt and angry that I woke him up and told him I was leaving. I left because I said I couldn't be in a relationship with someone who still cared about someone else like that and that wasn't ready to give 100%. 

We met up the following day to talk. He said that he was sorry, he felt so terrible about himself for hurting me and that he was going to work on the communication and distance. We made up, we both felt like the fire was back, and I thought everything was good. 

We went to dinner again and it felt like the same thing. He was distant, he wasn't really paying any attention to me, I felt alone in the relationship again. When we got home, he went to take a shower and his iPad rings, its his ex on FaceTime. I got really suspicious and looked through his iMessages and after we broke up the first time he had texted his friends saying he still loved his ex and that he loved and cared about me too and that he didn't know what to do. I ended it right there again, and he said it was best because he was hurting me and he didn't know what he wanted or what his thought were and that he wasn't ready for a relationship. We met yesterday to give each other out stuff back, it was very emotional and it actually ended good. We said we missed each other, that he wasn't ready for this and that he shouldn't have gotten into a relationship with anyone when he wasn't over his ex, and that he just wanted me to be happy. He said he was going to figure his emotions out, work on himself, and to see what he really wanted. He also said he didn't want me out of his life. I told him thats healthy, I need someone who can give 100%, and that if I'm still single or want to date when he finds himself maybe we can pick things back up but I'm not going to wait on him.

But I miss him so much. I feel like I am going to end up waiting on him and that by that time he might realize he wants to get back with his ex. I feel like him keeping me in his life is just so when he realizes what he wants whenever he can just get back together. Every time I miss him, I remind myself that he feels the same way about his ex that I feel about him now and it kills me. I want to get back together with him, but I know that it wouldn't be a healthy relationship and I deserve 100%. 

So I guess I really don't know why I made this post, I guess I just wanted to tell someone. I still care about him a lot, and I still love him. He texted me ""goodnight :)"" last night and I couldn't keep it together. I asked him why, its so soon, its confusing to know what you want and he just said he wanted to keep each other in our lives. I don't know, I'm confused, hurt, angry, sad, excited for the future, glad I can find someone who can make me 100% happy, and then sad again. How do I deal, what do I do. I don't want to end up killing my future relationships by not being over my ex like he did with ours. I really just want to text him and tell him how much I miss him, that I know he wants this, because I can tell he does want this. Just not right now.

Not really sure where to ask this question, so I figured what the hell?  My boyfriend and I have been going out for almost 10 months.  Things are amazing, and I have zero complaints.  But I do have a question.

About 4 months in, we stopped using condoms.  Both of us got tested before hand, and I got blood-tested for the entire spectrum of things as part of a wellness test a couple months back.  We're both negative for everything.  Our relationship is 100% monogamous, and I have no reason whatsoever to think that isn't the case.  

But there's been this nagging feeling in the back of my head that comes up every once in a while something like 'If I'm having this much bareback sex, I need to get tested.'  Am I being paranoid/crazy?  I mean, if it was just for my own mental health, I could just go get tested and that would be that.  But I kind of want to ask the BF to get tested as well.  Is that ridiculous?

One year is kind of my max-out in terms of relationship length (although I hope this one is a lot longer) so part of this is just I've never been in a relationship this long where we didn't use condoms.  Uncharted waters, and all.

They may be too jaded themselves by all the crap to be able to let me in and get to know me better.
