Can we all agree this isn't always the case? I remember receiving the same kind of support and kindness from friends and the community alike when I finally came out myself, but things barely have been better since then. If anything, they might've been *worse*. I can point out why:

* Sometimes, it feels better to stay inside the closet than to date jerks and learn the hard way that not everyone is willing to make you happy like you are (was?) willing to make them happy too. All in all, I'd rather still have a heart than break it completely by meeting cold people that approached you just because of your sexual orientation.

* One of the most incredible things is having that awesome, overwhelming support from friends, but not all of them may agree with it and you might eventually lose some people you though it was important to you. Of course, this is all meant to happen if you do come out, but it still is a harsh thing to get over with.

* Maybe you're stuck middle-way like me: Your friends know and support you, but your family still don't. Sometimes, this middle void is even worse. But let's assume you were corageous enough so even your parents know: OK, now you've got the pressure to make them believe you're able to be happy that way without feeling shaken when above-mentioned jerks show up, or else you risk making them believe you're sad just because you're gay. Weird, right?

* You might sometimes get involved in things you're not even aware about or don't even care about. Say you've made some gay friends ever since coming out. Some of them might be that pro-homosexuality type and drags you into discussions you don't even feel like participating. On the other hand, you might be the pro-homosexuality kind of guy and might find it surprising that some of your friends are content and confortable about just being gay without having to ""fight for their rights"". It's a clash of interests either way and that hurts friendships if carried along for too much time.

Ok, maybe I went overboard, but I tried to hit all possible bases. At least in my opinion/perception of life, coming out doesn't equals to a way leading to happiness. *Or* maybe I'm doing something wrong or having a twisted way of perceiving something.

But what about you? Do you agree that coming out may lead you to happiness? What's your story?

I am not a law student, I have not read the laws, and I do not know the validity of any of the claims. What I do know is that in Arizona we had a similar type of law trying to pass last year and it was my impression that it was written in a way where not serving a gay person would be really difficult to legally pull off in court. I remember reading an article by a law professor at ASU stating that it was meant for something like a Christian taxi driver being uncomfortable driving a Muslim person to a religious establishment. Again, I don't know the validity of this, but I recall reading that the wording was such that there needed to be a fairly strong argument for why the act was breaching what was religiously comfortable.

That being said, I have no idea what the recent bills state, and all I have read has been media claiming this is horrible. I wanted to see if I could facilitate a discussion about what this really means or if we are all being a bit extreme.

Also, my two cents, if a flower shop didn't want to serve me, fuck them. I understand the slippery slope, and I don't think discrimination is okay for employers or people who rent out places to live, schools, etc. But most establishments where you are buying a service already have the right to refuse service, and it's their loss.

My balls are also kinda smaller, too. Overall, I feel like my genes are turning out to make a gay man who's dick isn't up to par with his peers. I also realized that I'm not even sure I have moves when it comes to topping; I hear it's about how you use it, but when I think about that I don't really use it any other way other than to slide in and out of an asshole. I'm vers, and have been fucked by a bigger guy who was around my size downstairs and a vers top and I felt a little underwhelmed. Now I just feel inadequate. I feel like I drew a shorter straw and like I don't know how to please a bottom. Sometimes, in missionary, it feels like as much motion I give to the ocean there is still not a lot of movement (though I try hard to do better with that). All these things make me view my dick as average-small.

In summation I feel too small in the basement and it's affecting my confidence. Does anyone have any tips for better topping, advice for feeling better or words of encouragement? Is there any chance that at 22, my dick has yet to grow?

I've always had a bit of a love/hate relationship with gyms, over the past few years I've gone for a couple of small spells. I'd never really understood it until I saw someone post on reddit (lurking, woops) that basically said stop looking for motivation to go to the gym and just make yourself go, which made me change how I looked at it and (as if it wasn't obvious) realise I actually had to put in some hard work. At the time I was also unemployed so it gave me something to do and I went to the gym about 4/5 days a week for 3 months. Then I got a job again though and somehow managed to stop going but I realise now I miss what I had. The only thing though is that I'm never sure if what I was/am doing was/is the right thing for me, I basically worked off of a plan given to me by one of the guys at the gym and sort of stuck to it all the time because I didn't/don't know what else to do.


My routine was this:

Warm-up //
Cross trainer

Cardio //
Treadmill: 15 mins (1 min walking, 1 min running etc.) /
Bike: 15 mins /
(sometimes) Rowing machine: 1000m (100m slow, 100m fast)

Weight Machines //
Crunch machine: 3 x 10 @ 90lbs /
Converging chest press: 3 x 10 @ 110lbs /
Shoulder press: 3 x 10 @ 75lbs /
Leg press: 3 x 10 @ 140lbs /
Lateral pulldown: 3 x 10 @ 110lbs



I'm male, 6'0 and 150lbs so I'm not particularly fat but I do feel a bit chubby round the edges. I know that I want to trim that down so I'm a bit more lean and also build up a little bit muscle as well (though not interested in going to extremes). Basically what I'm asking here is should I try moving forward with that? Or is there something else I should do instead?

I appreciate any help I can get, I feel a bit clueless when it comes to this.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;(x-posting this in the hopes of more advice)&lt;/p&gt;

I've dated other guys, but he is my first serious boyfriend. These past few weeks I've noticed some suspicious behavior and decided to check a gay dating/hook-up website we both used to frequent before we met.  Sure enough, he was on it, contacted the fake account I was on, asking for pictures and potentially meeting for a coffee date. Later on I confronted him in person.

He broke down and said that he hasn't been feeling attracted to me for the past 6 months. He still loves me, but the sexual attraction is just not there any more. He tries so hard (no pun intended). He doesn't know what's wrong with him. This explains his performance in the bedroom, which I've attributed to stress. He also would masturbate rather than have sex with me, but I figured he just wanted a release since it was after a long day (I've done the same) and he still had work to do at home in the evening.  He was wanting to see what other guys were out there, and he was very tempted. But he swears he would never cheat. I believe him, I think.

However, in all other aspects of our relationship, we both agree that it's been pretty damn good.

So, we made the decision to split up. I told him I still loved him. But I can't be with him if he feels that way. He still loves me, and he agrees. Our break up was very very peaceful and we discussed issues at length in a calm and rational manner. We concluded that it was for the best since we are both at a turning point in our careers - I am hunting for a job and I can now include other geographic regions now that I don't have to consider him. 

The thing is, we still live together until our lease ends in a couple of months. We still sleep in the same bed. No sex (so far). It's a very weird situation. There's no other place in the house where we can sleep comfortably separately. I think I'm ok with it. And I think he is too. Though I find it odd that we don't cuddle anymore.

Today, though, he confessed to me if breaking up is truly the right thing to do. And I say ""I don't know, what do you think?""  After discussing some more, I start breaking out in tears and he goes ""maybe, we should get back together. So you don't get sad anymore."" 

I told him to stop saying shit like that. I continued, ""I'm more than happy to get back together. But you shouldn't get back with me out of pity. You have to WANT to be with me and WORK on the issues you have. You said you're no longer attracted to me, how can you change that? Think about what you say. Don't give me false hope. Take some time to think about what you want and then get back to me.""

So I've been noticing a trend with guys I've talked to since coming out 1.5 years ago.  I have never been in a serious relationship, although that is something I would like in the somewhat near future.  I have been noticing that every time I begin talking to a guy and get close, something inside me pushes away.  It's like I either: lose interest (for no explainable reason), find something about them I dislike to validate breaking things off, or get a random case of FOMO where I feel afraid that I'm missing out on something better or someone that I fit perfectly with.  This is something I used to do with girls in high school before I even was aware of my sexuality.  The frustrating part, is that I feel like I have let a lot of great guys slip through the cracks because I clearly have some unresolved problem.  I really cannot explain why exactly I feel this way, but the only conclusion I have been able to come up with is that finding a way out is a defense mechanism out of fear of opening myself up.  I have had a lot of instances in my life where I have put too much trust in individuals only to be disappointed.  If this is my problem, I honestly have no idea how to begin to work through it.  There's a guy I've been seeing for about a month now who lives about 2 hours away.  He's seriously the whole package, sweetest guy I've ever met.  And I know I want to continue to explore it and see where it goes, but I am suddenly losing interest in him for literally no reason.  I keep thinking that maybe I'm not into the distance, but I have always believed that if I really like someone, the distance wouldn't matter.  I just feel like this sudden loss of interest isn't due to distance, but it's due to my fear of vulnerability.  I really want to change, because I want to have happy and healthy relationships in my life.  I'm obviously not expecting to find Mr. Right or ""the one"" anytime soon, but I realize I never will if I don't start working on this problem.  I also understand that I may need to stay single for a while to fully work out these issues, which to me, is the most important thing right now.  If any of you have gone through this, or have any sort of advice or anything, it would mean a lot to throw some my way.

I live in the Midwest. I hate the cold winters here and how everything looks so dead for half the year. I basically go into a depression every winter and come out of it every spring. I don't think I could be happy here like that even if my family situation were perfect. 

I'm also gay, and my parents are very homophobic. My dad  reminisces about how he used to beat up gay kids in his high school and laments that kids don't do that anymore (I'm not exaggerating).  My mom would probably be more accepting, but she also is against gay people and really wants me to have kids. My parents told my sister and I when we were 11 (gay marriage was becoming a hot social issue) that if we were gay they would kick us out. 

I ended up with a full ride scholarship to a state school so I thought it was sensible to stay instead of moving then. I'm really starting to regret that but I have too many units to transfer. As soon as I get my degree I want to move to Los Angeles. I've already made some pretty good gay friends there via Facebook. 

I'll have a biology (another reason why I hate everything being dead looking here for 1/2 the year) degree after 3 more semesters. ~3.6 gpa. 

I've never lied and said that I was straight to anyone, but hiding that I'm gay has basically consumed my life. I have extreme anxiety talking on the phone or even going in public for fear that people are going to figure it out and it will get back to my parents (small town). So I don't have any work experience yet except for 1 (maybe two if I get one of the ones I applied to this summer) internship. 

I think this is going to get better once I move and am out because I can talk to the few people who I've told I'm gay on the phone and even FaceTime them. So my main problem is that I'm going to look really bad on paper as far as my résumé is concerned for awhile. I will force myself to deal with the anxiety and at least get a  job at a store or something this summer if I don't get an internship. This will help me save money because I have virtually no expenses. 

Can someone just give me more perspective on the things I need to do to make this work? How much money to you think I should try to save before moving (obviously more is better but a reasonable figure would be really helpful)? How do people get jobs in new towns without in person interviewing for them? I'd ideally like to have one before I commit to moving. 

I really have to make this work, because I feel so trapped and unhappy here. Moving to LA is the one happy prospect in my life, but I don't think I have enough worldly experience to make a good enough plan to make it work. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

I just need to vent, and get some other perspectives. **tl;dr** at the end. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, I have this friend. We've known each other since we were 13 (which makes it about 10 years now, I'm 23), and we've become very good friends over the years. We both came out as gay when we were 16, we've both struggled with getting in touch with other gay guys, and with getting into relationships over the years. In secret, I've always had a liking for him. Whereas I've had crushes on several people, including another friend I've written about here, his is the only one that could possibly be reciprocated since he's gay. So he's been kind of special to me. 

&amp;nbsp;

When we were 18, we had a trip to France with some other friends. While drunk and sharing a bedroom with him, I admitted to my liking him. His reply was that he thought of me as a very close friend, but not in a romantic way. I was okay with that. Later during the same trip, however, we both got shitfaced drunk, I had a blackout, and apparently ended up blowing him. Not proud of it, but it happened. Whatevs. 

&amp;nbsp;

Since that time, we've maintained a close friendship, and we've gotten onto the subject of relationship several times. He's always maintained his stance of liking me as a friend. I've never had a problem with that, and have moved on. Since France, I've grown, sexually and mentally, and have been actively dating with a couple of people. He hasn't, and I remain his only sexual experience to date. 

&amp;nbsp;

Recently, I begun dating a guy I really like. When I told my friend this, he became... weird. Quiet. I didn't think much of it until the day before yesterday, as we were hanging out at my place with some other friends. We'd just had a couple of drinks, when he became... rather emotional. And touchy. Kind of clingy too. If I hadn't known any better, I'd say he was flirting with me. Which is weird, as he doesn't usually do that. In addition, he continually expresses that he wishes he was more like me... Which, to me is silly, because he's wonderful enough as he is. 

&amp;nbsp;

I'm at a point where I don't really know what's happening, or what to make of this. His behavior is normal in all other instances. I still like him a lot. There's nearly nothing I wouldn't do for him, but I honestly don't know if he's more into me, or if he's just jealous or what. Any ideas?

&amp;nbsp;

**tl;dr:** Long-time gay friend (both gay), always wanted to just be friends. Now I'm dating another guy, suddenly he's acting weird and flirty. Don't know what to make of it.

Update 1 

https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/31arkg/update_had_sex_with_my_friend_while_on_holiday/

So something just happened between me and my friend which came out of nowhere, he called me again yesterday and asked him if I could come over to his house. He mentioned about what happened on the holiday and I told him to let it go and forget about it! But he was different this time, he was more open about talking about it, so I went over and he was sat on the sofa, looking at me as I sat down next to him. 

He smiled at me and then put his arm around me, he asked if I was a good friend and I said yes, and I said that I'm very supportive of him, but I was still a bit awkward about what was going on, he was never like this before. We talked about my bisexuality and I told him that I have seen people and have experimented with them, and he was happy for me and wanted to hear all the stories. 

So I told him and I was proud to tell him and then his hand touched mine, he mentioned that he has been thinking about it for a while and we talked about it more, he talked about how he was dealing with his sexuality and then he kissed me. It was weird because of how he has been dealing with it, but I went with it and kissed him back. He took me too his bedroom and we had sex again, almost like we did on the holiday.  

Afterwards we were lying on the bed, talking a bit more about his feelings and how he dealt with them. It was great talking to him about it, but after I felt like it may affect our friendship if something goes wrong and the next day he says that it was a mistake or something like that. It was fun, but I'm worried!
