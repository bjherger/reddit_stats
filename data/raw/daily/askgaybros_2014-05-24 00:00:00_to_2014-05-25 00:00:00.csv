My phone has no pass code lock. Apparently I put too much trust in people.

I came into the room as my dad was just leaving the house, and he said I had a missed call. I look and it was this guy I've been seeing, but before his missed incoming call was an OUTGOING call just before. No one else was in the house. My dad called him.

I called him back, he said he answered the first call with ""Good morning,"" then the call ended. My dad hung up.

My last text to him from the night before said, ""You make me so happy. Sweet dreams (kissing emoji)""

I'm in disbelief at the moment, and idk what to feel. Dad is vehemently anti-gay. I know he knows, and he knows that I know that he knows. lol. Oh, and I'm supposed to go on a trip with him next weekend. Plus, I'm in the process of moving back home temporarily. My timing is impeccable.

Wish me luck bros. I'll keep you posted.

Update:

I haven't noticed any change in my dad's or my mom's attitudes or behavior, everything seems to be pretty normal. Neither of them have even said anything. Right now I feel pretty indifferent, although I'm still annoyed about the whole privacy thing. 

I finished moving all of my things to the house, and they keep bugging me that I need to put all of it away in the extra room that used to be my sister's. Right now it's all taking up space in the garage. I'll take that to mean I'm not getting kicked out. So I've got that going for me, which is nice.

I'll update again if anything else happens.

Sorry for the wall of text but I could really use some help. My boyfriend and I have been in a relationship for many years. I love him and he loves me, and we're both sure that we want to spend the rest of our lives with the other.  nevertheless, ever since he got promoted at his company a couple of years ago our sex life has suffered. We almost never have sex anymore now, and when we do it's because I initiate it. The past 6 months we have had sex 3 times, and none of them were particularly memorable. It feels as if his heart is not in it , not the way it was before. We have talked about this many times before, with me being careful to explain how I feel about the situation. I understand my boyfriend's current job is very demanding, and that he gets very little sleep during the week. He also has to travel all over the country, at least for a week out of every month. He's always exhausted when he comes home, and in the weekends all he wants to do is sleep. He has admitted that being so overworked has esentially killed his sex drive, and I'm trying to be understanding but it's getting to the point where it's really affecting the satisfaction I get out of the relationship. I know that relationships are more than sex, and I'd be willing to settle for a few great times every now and then, but the way things are now just makes me feel like sex with me is a chore to him and the fact that it's always me initiating sex sometimes makes me feel as if I were asking him for a favor. Again, I've told him this, and each time we agree to try harder to make sure both of us are happy, but in the end nothing changes. I've started to think that maybe it's because he doesn't find me attractive anymore. He says that's not it, but if it's not then why isn't he making more of an effort to work on this? The thing that bothers me the most is that even though I know he is extremely tired by the end of the week, at least once a month he will go out drinking with his friends Friday or Saturday nights in order to relax, even if it means staying up all night and getting even less sleep during the weekend. I just don't understand why he is willing to dedicate an entire night to chilling with his friends and not even one hour for sex with me. I guess I would just like to hear from someone who has been in a similar situation, who maybe would give me some advice. I'm starting to worry because, for me, it's getting to the point where I'm sick of jacking off at night on my own and I've started fantasizing about what it would be like to have sex with someone else.

Lurked here for a while, it's a really cool place. Seems a shame my first post is so negative!

I was hoping someone with a similar experience might help me (or anyone with an opinion really). I've been with my boyfriend now for just over a year and over that time we've only really had one problem, sex.

I should give you some context. My boyfriend is a little older than me, early thirties and I'm late twenties. I'm his first relationship. He says he's bisexual, but his sexual history before me has just been a couple of slightly drunken/awkward sounding encounters. So I started this relationship knowing he has an unconventional romantic/sexual history and there would be some issues there.

The sex at first was understandably difficult, but the problem is, it hasn't improved at all. Sex is very much something that *happens* to him. I make all the moves, tell him what to do etc. He doesn't seem to get anything out of it. He won't have anal sex either way, doesn't really seem to enjoy giving head, or receiving it. He's never once came (and I really, really have tried). Basically our sexual interactions just end in him jerking me off, and that just bums me out now.

We've talked about it. I struggle to try and strike the tone of expressing my concerns without freaking him out, but it's difficult because he's very sensitive and gets defensive. He says he feels bogged down by my expectations, but I don't know what I can do about that. 

The thing is, I understand and have had similar feelings to him (feeling sexually inadequate), but I worked through them, whereas he doesn't seem to be trying. We've talked about getting professional help (you can get free sex therapy in places in the UK), but I haven't pushed that.

I really do love him, and the relationship otherwise is great. But I'm at the point now of giving up. Has anyone else experienced this? Do you know of anyone who has dealt with sexual insecurities and how they did it? Or do you think this is hopeless?

I made an awesome gay buddy whose a good hearted guy about 8 months ago at work. We spoke via text everyday and most of the day for a few months and hung out at least 2 or 3 times a week. I've been going through a rough patch with some depression and anxiety issues so it felt nice to have a good friend to take my mind off it all and confide in when I just felt like I couldn't handle the crap life throws. We would confide in each other and I grew attached. Everything was starting to feel pretty good again. He's a best friend for sure, and he's said he feels the same way.

As of Feb I think the new relationship energy faded on his side, so he no longer has a desire to speak every single day or hang out as often. Nowadays we hang out maybe once every other week. Granted we see each other at work 3 days a week, but we don't really get to chat much or do anything fun. He also has gotten busier at work, and i know if i brought it up that's that he'd say.

Still, even with all the possibilities that could explain it I just can't help but feel that there's maybe something I'm doing to mess this all up. Maybe I'm too needy or too clingy. I guess I'm also scared that I need him a heck of a lot more than he needs me. I also can't help but feel that he's too nice to say anything if I am causing any damage or being ""too much"" to deal with. 

I can't help but feel frustrated with him in all this, since I really miss talking to him daily and hanging out often. I don't want to take it out on him either and I've done a decent job of not doing so I think.

I'm extremely socially adept, to the point that I cringe when others do something awkward or fail to read a cue. Outwardly, I'm always friendly, sympathetic, and great at feigning interest.

Inwardly, I'm basically an elitist douchebag. No joke is too soon. No topic or person is off-limits.

The feeling of being alone sucks, we all know it, felt it, been it. Alone. Right? 
Everywhere we look, we see what we want. The feeling of... not being alone. So i pose to you my question. Why am I alone?

Everywhere we look, we see what we want. The feeling of... not being alone. So i pose to you my question. Why am I alone?

I'm going to try to make this quick, yet with necessary back info...

I am twenty-one. Grew up in Los Angeles in a big-tight knit family. I have a twin brother, and a sixteen year-old sister! When I was younger and started to realize about my sexuality, I understood it was not ""the norm""

So I always repressed my feelings, and emotions. I thought I would eventually get over the way I felt. That never happened.

Flash forward to this year. Now I can legally go out to bars and maybe meet similar people? I was optimistic. I'm really not conceited at all, but I was constantly hounded when I would go out. It feels nice in the beginning, but got annoying because it becomes a distraction to actually finding someone your attracted to, physically and mentally. 
Then this happened... On my way out of a club in West Hollywood, I locked eyes with another guy from across the dance floor. I'm reserved and shy, so I don't know what got a hold of me... but I claimed him and he became mine. He was an out-of-state student, and we ""went out"" or ""saw one-another"" consistently until he left L.A.
Leo-Aries. Fire &amp; Fire. Every-time I spent time with him, it's like time stopped... Not only was he one of the cutest guys I'd ever laid on, but more importantly, we connected and were on the same wavelength.
I can't even describe how good it finally felt to feel the things I did for the first time, that many of my straight-friends went through so carelessly in high school and early college. Not hating. I just feel like I treated this with way more care, because I guess I was waiting for so long to finally feel these things... I didn't want to mess anything up? 

Sorry if that went too long, but I need a little advice...
I really want to come out to my family. I want to be able to share such a special time in my life, and to finally not have to hide all I do in the shadows.

P.S... My sixteen year old sister knows. I'm scared to see the shock on the faces of my Mom, Father, and Twin-brother. Should I simply come out, or will it be too much to share both?

We celebrated our one month yesterday and we just had dinner, nothing too special. I've been happy for the most part dating him, there haven't been any major issues. But sometimes things pop up that bother me and they are starting to bug me more and more. 

A few examples to get the point across. I used to smoke weed a lot more often, but lately I smoke few and far in between because it makes me feel dumb and messes with my anxiety. Well he smoke from the minute he wakes up, before he goes to work, during his breaks at work, and right after work with friends. He can blow through an eighth in 2-3 days. Like I don't care if he smokes, but he uses almost all of his money towards that and it just feels like he has a high reliance on it. This kind of goes in with that I feel like he has 0 ambition. He isn't in school, all he does is work and come home and smoke/eat. I've asked him what he wants to do with his life and he never has given me an answer. 
I'm a pretty skinny, fit guy. I try and be careful about what and how much I eat. But he on the other hand could care less, and it's starting to show. I keep saying we need to try and hit the gym together but always get an excuse in the end. Finally, I kid you not we have sex everyday, sometimes multiple times a day. That may sound great, and it was for a little while but now I feel like all I'm good for is buying him alcohol (he's 20) and sex. If I turn him down, he gets all dramatic and upset about it.

Like I said, usually the goods outweigh the bads. He's pretty sweet to me, and let's me know how much I mean to him etc. And I usually reciprocate that BUT I can't get all of these negative things out of my mind...

So what do you guys think? Am I being too sensitive to this stuff? I know some of it isn't a big deal and I need to learn to accept that may just be how he is. Is he using me? Is he a keeper? Should I maybe consider other options? I like him quite a lot and don't necessarily want to break things off but at the moment I feel pretty used and like I'm dating a loser :(","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay I&amp;#39;ve posted a few times about this guy I have been seeing.

Initially, the two of us met at Uni through friends. I wasn't attracted to him in the slightest. Anyway, a couple of weeks pass and our friends suggest that we all go out for dinner/drinks/whatever. After most had people left, we ended up getting into quite a deep conversation. We found ourselves being able to connect to a significant degree. After that night, we ended up talking over Skype pretty frequently. I still wasn't interested romantically but somehow, he was incredibly easy to talk to. Conversation could flow with ease for hours at a time. One late night I reveal that I'm into guys, and he completely throws a curveball and tells me he has (very strong) feelings for me. At that point, I still had no feelings for him because I had my eye on somebody else. That somebody else ended up rejecting me. The first guy then asked me if I wanted to try as long as we took it slow. 

Given that we had talked so much, I figured there was something there that was worth exploring so we started seeing each other. My feelings have since grown for him from nothing but I'm not sure if they're genuine or if I just want to be in a relationship because I've been feeling lonely. I feel that objectively speaking, we're not a good match and it's a fact that's always present at the back of my mind. We have very different world views and when we're not together, I find that his personality can be quite abrasive and lacking in subtlety. At the end of the day, he's just extremely different from someone that I usually could see myself with. 

He's completely infatuated with me right now. He tells me that he misses me a lot but often, it can feel very corny and shallow. He sends multiple texts/calls throughout the day however I'm not sure how I feel about them. I admit that it's really sweet but it can also be suffocating. He's also started referring to me as his boyfriend (although only in private) and he seems to keep wanting me to put a label on things. I've talked to him and we've both agreed to take it slow but ultimately, he feels what he feels and it seems unfair to him for me to string him along while I'm not completely committed. Further, there is a minor point that the physical attraction is not really there for me. He's not a bad looking guy at all but I just..didn't see him like that.  

At the same time however it is important to mention that my own feelings towards him are building, I miss him when he's not around and the feeling I get when he looks at me, I just know that he believes in me and is there for me unconditionally - and that feeling, well it's like a drug. It says a million words without having to utter a single syllable. Still, there's a lingering thought in mind that he isn't really what I want and to be honest, it isn't making me happy. We have a definite emotional connection but for lack of a better phrase, I'm just not in love with him. Still, I'm scared that if I break it off now, I'll have missed out on the possibility of something great. 

Overall, I'm not sure if I should keep going with this and see where it goes or end it before it becomes messy. My feelings are all conflicting each other and I'm just kinda all over the place at the moment. 

Any advice is deeply appreciated. 

**TL;DR:** I've been seeing someone for a little while now (a month) and I'm not sure if he's right for me or if I just want to be in a relationship because I've been alone for too long. My feelings are growing but at the same time, I feel suffocated. Most of all, I can't help but feel that something is 'off' - it feels way too difficult.

She also, after I questioned how she would feel about it, said if it were another girl she would be all HELL NO but with a guy she&amp;#39;s not afraid of him leaving her. She also added an addendum of if at anytime anyone wants out, it&amp;#39;s over. Period. Still not sure what I&amp;#39;m going to do, but leaning towards not doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
