He was tall, handsome, nice, gentle, and we had a lot of things in common. We dated for a little bit, and we decided to go into a relationship.

He was 24, I was 19, and there was things he wanted to do I couldn't. Like go to clubs and drink. 

Then there was sex. He told me ""No sex until we know when its ready.""

He lives at his dad's house and I live at my parents house for school, so sex was difficult. We never had it and we never communicated about it. 

For the next two months he went silent on me. Barely texted me and when I asked him to hang out, he was either busy or with friends. Obviously having no time for me. 

I suspected things were amiss, it was a feeling, a strange urge in the back of my mind. All of the sudden new names were popping up on snap chat.

But, because my dumbass self trusts too easily, I didn't dwell on it too much. 

Flash forward to thanksgiving break. 

My friend at Oklahoma State tells me he sees my boyfriend on grindr. His relationship status single, his age wrong, with a shirt off. 

Not looking for friends.

I texted him and asked him why he had one and the only reply I got back was ""and...."" And a snapchat of him leaving an apartment complex with a smiley face. 


Am I that stupid? Did I really just let some good looking guy in my life and fuck me over emotionally because I believed in trust? 

How do I go forward? 

I want to meet him and just talk to him and ask him why. But then again, I want to punch him.

Title says it all. I'm not sure if I should download it or not. I'm being such a horndog these days it's not even funny anymore. I'm sort of becoming desperate, porn and my hand is not enough anymore, I want a real person now lol. So the thing is, that I want to start a slut phase now since ""dating"" apps have not worked the way I wanted and it seems like no one wants to date me either. 

I also don't want to be a virgin anymore and wanna have sex so bad (my body wants it).  I feel bad telling guys on these apps I'm a virgin as I'm scared to what their reaction might be. Some say it's cute and other say it's nice since I'm not a little ho fucking everybody. But it also makes me feel bad when I'm talking to younger guys who already had sex or to guys who I don't really find attractive but have gotten more action than me (SORRY that sounds very douchey).

It also seems like guys my age are tired of hookups and are looking for something more ""stable"" and you could say that I haven't started to ""live"" life. So basically it seems like everyone has had sex at least once except me and that bothers me. A lot. And I want to change that.

I know that I've said that I wanted my first time with a fellow virgin but I guess that is like finding a needle in a haystack so I might as well give up on that ideal/fantasy. A relationship would be nice but that seems like a lot of work and to be honest I want some pleasure now. I think about it like this, okay what if I do get into a relationship with someone and they're not a virgin? That means I just wasted my time waiting and could have had fun sooner.

I don't want to live my life in regrets anymore so I think I might jump in the pool this time around. Any advice? What to look out for, etc?

Ideally I would want to hookup with someone also looking for their first time, how do you put this on your profile (virgin4virgin? looking for a guy who to do it for the first time? lol idk)

I recently posted this question on [AskFeminists](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/2nmxyd/is_the_romantic_shhh_actually_sexist_and_abusive/).

**********

&gt;You know when you see in movies that a really romantic scene is being set up with music and everything, and the girl starts saying something which is vaguely like ""we can't be doing this"", and the guy puts his finger to his lips (or sometimes even her lips) and smiles and very softly goes ""shhhhhh..."" and then usually they start making out?

&gt;I was just thinking, do you think that kind of gesture is actually really sexist or inappropriate? Considering that the man is essentially silencing the woman, often when she's mounting some kind of objection, could / should we see this type of seductive gesture as a form of abuse (both in movies and real life)? Isn't it the same thing as some of the lines that PUAs use to defuse objections and get to sex (like that guy who just got banned from the UK used to smile and quip ""irrelevant!"" when a girl told him things like ""but I don't know you"").

&gt;I've been trying to think of contexts in which this type of gesture could be used harmlessly, but no matter which way you turn it, it's still a form of silencing the woman (besides, if you concede that, then you can also use ""context"" to justify the lines of PUAs). The only way it could be acceptable would be as part of set pre-determined role-play, like as part of a BDSM scenario or something along the lines.

&gt;Finally - and might as well - have you ever had a man do that to you? How did you feel / react?

**********

Somebody mentioned doing this to partners of both sexes and it suddenly struck me that the question might sound very different if you're discussing the gesture in terms of a man-man rather than a man-woman relationship.

So I'd like to ask your opinion - do you think the ""Shhh"" is abusive and/or sexist, and is it (equally or differently) inappropriate in the context of gay relationships?

PS: I hope this is the right reddit for this type of question - if I'm in the wrong place, apologies and can someone point me the right way? Thanks!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone,&lt;/p&gt;

The only way it could be acceptable would be as part of set pre-determined role-play, like as part of a BDSM scenario or something along the lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally - and might as well - have you ever had a man do that to you? How did you feel / react?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somebody mentioned doing this to partners of both sexes and it suddenly struck me that the question might sound very different if you&amp;#39;re discussing the gesture in terms of a man-man rather than a man-woman relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;d like to ask your opinion - do you think the &amp;quot;Shhh&amp;quot; is abusive and/or sexist, and is it (equally or differently) inappropriate in the context of gay relationships?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS: I hope this is the right reddit for this type of question - if I&amp;#39;m in the wrong place, apologies and can someone point me the right way? Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

Well actually I don't think I could actually say I lost it because I couldn't even get it in. This guy gave me my first blowjob and we've hung out a few times over the last few months and out of the blue he tells me he wants me to fuck him and I told him I've only had sex with girls and not guys so I might be nervous and he said he doesn't care and he wants to be my first so I agreed because he is the exact type of guy I'm attracted to. So I go over his house and he blows me and I was rock hard and started rimming him and I go to take the aim and as soon as I get the condom on I go soft in a matter of a second. It just went downhill from there and I couldn't get it up, he tried sitting on top of me while I jerk him off and still nothing. He kept telling me to relax and that I'm trying too hard which just made me more nervous. Finally we just decided to frot and it was HOT and he came all over my chest and I came all over his balls and ass. I asked him if he wanted to try again this weekend and he said sure and then he told me that he thinks I'm really hot. So it doesn't sound like I blew it with him right? I feel like an ass because I kept apologizing and I probably sounded really annoying. I also got a blowjob earlier that day from someone else (I just started exploring my gay side so I'm going through that ""slut phase""), so maybe a combination of that, being nervous, under pressure and the fact that I really like this guy is what took a toll on me. I just don't get it cause now I'm thinking about his hot body sitting on top of mine or when I was slapping his ass with dick I get really hard, why couldn't I get this hard when it was actually happening? I really hope it's better the second time we do this, even though I did get some really hot frottage out of it.

Also, sorry for a wall of text.

So last night, I got into a discussion with my religous mother about if being gay is right. She believes being gay is a choice. She's also against gay merriage, and every time it's passed she says ""this country is going to pot."" She says she likes everyone and doesn't judge, but she said it's wrong. Her argument was, ""then what is sperm used for? Not to be wasted in some guys ass! That's why there's vagina!"" 

After discussing, she was coming around and she said she wouldn't judge and that she loves me no matter what. I asked her if she would support me if I was, and she said ""I would just want you to be happy. It's okay and I would still love you."" So I told he that I don't want to worry about liking anyone because I might like both, and I don't want to be labeled as either. I just want to be me. She said that was fine and hugged me. She then told me I was the best. I replied, ""I'm so glad your so understanding of me being bi. I was really scared to tell you."" 

That's when it went down. She glared at me and looked half scared. She said, ""you're gay??!"". I replied, ""I like both."" She replied, ""I didn't think we were talking about you!"" She started to get upset. At this point, I'm like *shit*. She was in a really good mood so I thought it was okay to tell her. If I knew she was going to act like that, I wouldn't have been ready yet.

She cried. She said it's wrong and kept crying. I told her that she needs to stop and not worry. I even reminded her that I have a date with a girl Saturday night, and shed didn't calm down. She said, ""why would you choose this? I mean, how do you know?! You've never had sex before! I think it's because of your depression. We'll get you help and you won't be confused anymore."" The she kept crying and said, "" I have no family!"" 

(note: it's just me and her. My dad died and we don't talk to other family. That comment really stung). She then said, ""you're not a sissy guy!"" I then yelled at her that she's ignorant.

I started to cry, and I told her, ""But mom, you said you'd still love me and everything would be okay! You said you understood! Will and Grave is your favorite TV show even!"" She stopped crying and started thinking about it. She said, "" it's a funny show and I like making fun of them because they're gay!"" I then threw all of the nice stuff back in her face thy she said a moment ago. She the said, "" I just want you to be happy."" 


So today she acted like nothing happened. We went to run errands and whatnot. Everything was normal. We love people watching and say stuff like, ""look at her/him, they're hot."" We do this to pass time and whatnot. So today We were at a store and this guy looked incredibly flamboyant. I told her that my gaydar went off. We talk like this all of the time (I promise we're not shallow. We're just bored people.) she shot me a fuck-you look then it got quiet. So later, we were at another store and I said, ""that guy is hot"". Like I said, we do this all of the time. She replied, ""don't ever say that about a guy again."" I reminded her that this was nothing different, and she said not to. I then asked (probably shouldn't have), ""So what will you do if I bring a guy home?!"" She said, ""We'll worry about that road when it gets here."" She was upset. I told her she was being unreasonable (for being upset) and I didn't want to have to repress anything around her. She replied 'fuck you'. 

So now I'm here. It's gotten incredibly awkward between us and I dont know what to do. She's all I got and the majority of my family has either died or moved all around. I'm about to graduate school, but I'm in no position to live on my own. I'm 19, and plan on going to community college. 

How can I get my mojo back with my mother? She's incrediy hard headed (part of the reason some of our family has nothing to do with us) and she refuses to change. But she is my mom and my best friend. She's helped me so much with my medical issues.
