What do you do when your straight BEST friend outs you to a lot of people? I thought he would know to keep it a secret (I live in a very homophobic country). I thought he was a very good friend, a soul-mate or something. I think he is depressed, because he's talking about suicide and sad things, says he is unsure of what is happening to him. I just started coming out to some of my other good friends, and I am getting a lot of love from them. I texted my best friend, that I came out to my other friends, but he told me not to talk about 'gay' things with him. He says he accepts me, but doesn't want to hear about it.. What kind of acceptance is that? I met with him and told him that his behaviour seemed a bit homophobic to me and he apologized for being a bad friend. Anyways, we just graduated from High-school and I was supposed to live with him in another city, because he has a flat there. But on the last day we have to move, he tells his grandmother about me, about my sexuality, about how I smoke and so on. Of course, his grandmother tells his parents and then I get a call from them that I won't be living with my friend and that I should take my belongings from there. I call my friend, and ask him wtf happened. He tells me that he doesn't know what he is doing and wants everyone to leave him so he could easily kill himself. He tells me that I should only live with other gay people. I feel like shit. Now all of his relatives know about me and I feel.. naked. I thought I knew him. Now a month has passed and I found another place to live. We have never contacted since, but judging from his facebook feed, he seems ok. I don't know what to do. I still think about him and I want to help him and make sure he is alright, but at the same time I can't forget what he has done.

I feel awful,  broken, incomplete.

I don't like attention.

I started a new job recently (last few months, basic service job) and I was immediately drawn to one of my co-workers. He's really cute, funny, we have a lot in common and we got along great, but, he has a boyfriend of 7 years.

Last month I found out he broke up with his boyfriend, and I was pretty excited. He's been casually dating people since they broke up, which I can understand since he just got out of a pretty serious relationship.

Here is where it gets a bit tricky...
We had a staff night out the other night and I got kinda drunk. Ended up walking him home and we made out. While we were making out he told me he wasn't looking for anything serious. I really like this guy and I don't think I could settle for a one night stand or a casual fling, I've been single for a long time and I'm ready for a relationship.

Well we left it at that for the night and we texted a bit and he told me how much he values our friendship and he does't want to hurt me blah blah blah...

So, he obviously finds me attractive since he made it pretty clear that he wanted to take me up to his apartment, he thinks I'm funny, cute, a great guy...

Should I hold out for him and wait until he's ready? Is he just friend zoning me in a nice way?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;OK so a bit of backstory.&lt;/p&gt;

My ""boyfriend"" is 17 a freshman in college and works 2 jobs. We basically live together and when I say basically meaning he stays at my house every night but still pays his grandma to live there. I can confirm he has 2 jobs and goes to them when he says he does. We've been together for 3 months and have seen each other practically every day. Now. Might I mention, he actually isn't my boyfriend. Sometimes he says he is but he hasn't asked me out. I have tried to ask him but he says we don't need a title. For now. I like him a lot as he got me the job I have now and has given me the motivation to go to school, he's the only person I've ever felt this way about. I don't know many people where I am at because I am from somewhere 500 miles away. 

Now before I get Into the cons I want to mention he is there for me and is with me all the time, i think he can be very nice and sweet at times and others he just doesn't want anything to do with me. Keep in mind this is someone who I care about a lot and I believe he cares about me too, but something here just isn't right.

He's using grindr ALOT, the same site I met him on and when I ask him about it he just says I can't control who he's with and he can't control who I'm with. He says he's just using it because he has gay friends on there but Im. Not sure. He's secretive about his phone as well. Also he says he's on grindr barely yet he's on there everyday 

He's kissed his friend in front of me before. 
This was a night we were really drunk and I hadn't known about it until I asked his friend when he passed out. He claims he didn't know about it and apologized a lot.

He won't have sex with me. 
We began having sex in the first few weeks we were together but now says he doesn't like to have sex? Could this be because he is finding pleasure somewhere else.

He is sort of disrespectful.
I do a lot for him. His parents are out of the picture as his mom is a drug addict and his dad is well Idk. We go to school together(he doesn't have a car) I do his laundry and feed him. Take him to work and allow him to use my car to go to work sometimes. But he doesn't appreciate it a lot of the time. He calls me fat even though I wiegh less than him and he likes to make fun of my appearance. Or just gets Ina grumpy mood with me. At one instance I can recall him saying how better his life could've been if he were still with someone whom he had been engaged with....

So I met this guy on POF with the hottest profile pic, and it says he's a bit older than me, a waiter, and lives in the same city. He messaged me first, thought I was attractive, I messaged him back. I'd never have thought that a guy that attractive would be into me before. In the end, we exchanged numbers and switched to texting.

Texting turned into sexting after he send a few suggestive pics. I was sorta suspicious at this point, because I asked for a pic of his abs, and he didn't respond [warning flag]. So I tried reverse image searching a few of the pics he sent me, but nothing came up, so I figured maybe it was just a fluke.

He finally sent over a full body pic of his real self (after sending over two pictures of ""his"" muscular arms), and of course he wasn't the dreamy hunky guy I thought he was. (If only.) Much too old and overweight.

(In hindsight, he kept asking me if I was ever into older guys when watching porn. \*sigh*)

The worst part is, he now has pics of me (none with my face, thank god. I'm not that stupid) that he can use on the next person.

Ugh, at this point I'm not even mad, just annoyed.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry, this is just a rant since I have no one else I can talk to about this.&lt;/p&gt;

Has anyone ever dated a couple? It's been on my mind lately as something that I'd like to explore someday, and I'd love to hear from y'all about your experiences, either here or privately. 

Where did you meet? 
How did you find each other?
What was the dynamic of the relationship like? 
How did it work out for you?
How did your friends and family react?
Anyone in a long-term relationships with more than one guy?

I've talked to a few friends about it and they've been super supportive. I guess I'd just like to talk to someone who's got some personal experience on the matter. 

Thanks in advance!

The first time we hung out was at the end of August, and we grabbed a beer together. We had great conversation and I thought that we clicked. We grabbed dinner the same week, and I picked him up. I didn't pay for him though, but one of my guy friends said I should pay since I invited him. I didn't take his advice because he dates girls, so I just assumed that he didn't know what he was talking about. I regretted not paying.

I can't remember when this happened, but we texted back and forth about how neither of us know what we want since we both just got out of a long-term relationship. Mine was 7 years and his was 4 years. We just knew that we liked hanging out with each other. We met up four other times after that for either grabbing drinks, meeting at the movie theater, or eating dinner. 

He came over last night so we could eat takeout Chinese and watch a movie. My couch is super long, so there wasn't really an opportunity to make a move. He was laying down under a blanket, and I sat upright at his feet with a different blanket. I tried to move my leg or hand close to his feet, but I'm not sure if I made it obvious enough what I was doing. He never really reciprocated. The movie ended, and I asked if he wanted to grab a drink with some friends of mine. He declined and said that he had a busy Friday, so that was understandable. I just sent him a text asking him if he wanted to grab drinks downtown, but he has yet to respond. 

Did I miss the boat in trying to make a move? Am I being friend-zoned? Should I try and chat with him about it via text or is this a conversation better suited for in-person? How do I bring it up? Do I just say, ""hey, so are you interested in being more than just friends?"" How do you make a move on a date? This is the first time I've been single since I was 19 (I'm 26 now), and I don't really remember how to make a move outside of my twin bed in the dorms or drunkenly on the dance floor of a nightclub.

However since I'm talking about a guy I like, I thought i might as well ask here since there seems to be no /r/askbibros subreddit.
    Anyways, there is a guy that I really like at school. I have a huge crush on him, but I'm an extremely shy person. I decided tough that if I do want to date this guy and maybe even move onto a relationship, then I just have to suck it up and talk to him. I can't just wait around or else nothing will happen!

I drop some hints but I feel that maybe I just need to actually tell him... Jesus I'm rambling....

To give a background on all this I might a guy on Grindr (I know, I know). We've met up 3 times: first time we went for a walk and drive and ended with me giving him a bj. Second time we met for coffee and third time we I went over to his to have a bit of fun because he was going to work in another country for 3 weeks and when he was getting back I'd be on holiday. 

So I message him when I'm on holiday, just asking how he was etc. it did take him 8 days to reply and when he did he apologised for replying so late and then we agreed to go for coffee. When I messaged him on the Monday for coffee it turns out he had been called back to work again in Wales. He told me he definitely wanted coffee when he got back and then asked me to check in with him and let him know how I was getting on. I found this strange, and sorta thought well maybe he does really like me. Anyway I text him and he doesn't reply, honestly this was no biggie at all because I really had nothing to say to check in with him and I did wait a week since we last texted. 

Anyway, on Tuesday the 9th of this month I messaged him on WhatsApp asking when he was home. I don't know what is wrong with his WhatsApp but when you message him only one tick appears which means his phone is off or he has no service and the message is on WA's servers and hasn't reached his phone. On the 11th he messaged saying 'Hey man, still in Wales :-( back week after next. You back in uni yet, how's the studies?'. Honestly I thought this was nice, and a bit strange. As I've got know him he doesn't text like this so I was sorta thinking ok he must like me. A guy actually messaged me when I was on holiday asking when I was home and I wasn't that interested in him so I was just like 'I'm home Tuesday :)'  

Fast forward to Sunday there. It's early and I'm on Grindr and he appears in my grid (he never does, he's actually just a bit outside my grid) so instead of being a normal person and using that to my knowledge, I messaged him ""I recognise that torso! :p glad you're home"" and... nothing. No reply. At all. Ok, now is the time I will add that he isn't a big texter, someone who can go a few weeks without messaging his friend's. Whatever, plus he's forgetful which I witnessed first hand when we had coffee. And I do know torso pics get a lot of messages, he's probably forgot. I left it and messaged him last night around 5:20pm. With his What'sApp being weird he technically didn't receive the message until 3:00pm today. He hasn't replied, but also he hasn't been on What'sApp since 3:16pm so for all I know he had to message something important and hasn't read my message yet. I know it's early days still, and if he hasn't replied by Monday then I'm done, but I just feel dejected, disappointed and hurt. Possibly on the verge of tears for some strange reason and I don't like it. I went on Grindr there and he must be in city centre cos he's appearing in my grid so hopefully he sees me and remembers (not gonna hold my breath on that one). 

I just feel lost. We both weren't looking anything serious, granted I have started to get feelings but it happened so gradually that it was different than other guys. He was really nice and genuine, he didn't want to do anal just yet which felt good because I felt he was pressurising me into doing anything. At the start of this month he did want to get coffee when he was back and now that I've said about it I'm getting silence. It sucks. Though for all I know he might reply by Monday but again that's not something I'm gonna hold out on. 

I'm writing this here because I know if I don't I'd probably message him on Grindr and ask did he get my What'sApp or just ask him how he is. He did tell me once that if I ever seen him online and wanted to talk to him and should do and that he would be easy going enough to reply and not be annoyed at me messaging. But still, I don't want to turn into a clinger :S 

I should also mention he's 31 and I'm 21. What I really liked about him was he told me he doesn't go under 26 but with me he felt I was mature and that I didn't seem 21. Finally a guy liked me for me. 

Sorry bros for this rambling wall of text, I could probably give myself solid advice but I just feel 'eeeehh' right now :/

Edit: Just want to add a few different things. While I was seeing him I was seeing others so I wasn't clinging to the fantasy of him, I was putting myself out there for either dates or fun just to explore and not get tied down. However, with him it got to the stage with myself that if he wanted something serious I'd of probably said yes but on the other hand I am totally happy being single and enjoying being young. I know I'm young and not getting my hopes up but to say this is probably the complete and under end of me and him is probably not the case. I will also add though I know he doesn't owe me anything to reply and that he is a very busy man so he probably will. Just at this minute I feel very doom and gloom.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just want to straight up apologise for rambling.

I'm looking for some advice on how to go about making other gay friends. 

Little background: I'm 26, living on my own in upstate NY. I grew up in a very conservative Christian house and was forced to go to a college that expels anyone who is openly gay because I was 17 and naive. So I wasn't able to come out until I moved away after college and became independent. 

Current situation: I still don't really know any other gay guys as friends in real life. Partly that's my fault for being introverted. I've met up with a couple guys I met online that are into similar stuff that I am but no one that lived close enough to really be a real life friend. I've also never had a boyfriend or sex before, which I totally want, but that's another issue.

What I've tried: I made profiles on a couple gay apps like grindr and have been trying to connect with guys in my area. I generally get ignored 75% of the time, get told something like not interested 20% of the time, and the rest chat a bit but have always stopped chatting well before agreeing to meet up to hang out. I have had offers to meet from a couple guys twice my age and I've even tried that but it's kind of hard to connect with someone that much older as friends, plus I'm not really attracted to them sexually which is mostly what they want from me.

So, any advice is appreciated. Also if any of you are in the NY capital region and wanted to chat and maybe get to know each other, let me know!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi guys.
