I had stomach troubles, he had trouble maintaining an erection, and because of my stomach problems he couldn't get in me because I couldn't relax. Cue embarrassment an awkwardness.

Cut to Wednesday night. We tried again. I did a looooot of prep work. From showering and getting water up in there to fingering myself. I managed to get 3 fingers in (but that still wasn't enough). This time I tried to ride him. I managed to get him all the way in! We went slow and it did hurt at first but then all the good feelings took over. We switched positions to missionary.

Just recently I came across a few sources suggesting that young men, such as myself (19 years old), should probably receive an HPV vaccination. Being somewhat of a paranoid STI-phobic person, I feel as if getting the vaccine will put me at ease. I have only had one sexual experience, which involved someone a bit older than myself, was strictly oral, and was a couple months ago.

So, today, my stress has reached a high point. This morning I visited the doctor's office to get a yearly check-up and some blood work done. During my appointment I asked for my immunization record. I just assumed that it would show whether or not I had be vaccinated for HPV. Well, it didn't. I wish I would have spoken up to my doctor about it. Argh! For some reason, I am assuming that I have not received the HPV vaccine since it is mostly targeted at the female population. Can you get your blood drawn and be vaccinated in the same day?

Anyways, now I am conflicted. I would like to be vaccinated, but I'm not out to my parents, or anybody for the matter. While I am not opposed to the idea of coming out to my parents, I'm not sure I want to at the moment. I don't think my parents would react adversely if I told them, but I know the gay label and all the bullshit that comes along with it would be practically tattooed on me. My original plans entailed coming out when I was truly sexually active.

I can't help but wonder if I was just scared to ask my doctor today. Had my doctor asked me, ""are you hetero, bi, or homosexual?"" as one of the standard questions, I would have mentioned that I am gay. But I have never actually told someone *by my own will*, ""I am gay,"" so maybe that is what held me back. The realities of just how difficult coming out can be hit me hard to day, really hard.

Getting back to the point, being that my parents manages my medical visits, what would you guys recommend I do to get vaccinated? I feel as if I have only three options:

* Wait another year to visit the doctor's office, with some testicles this time. **Con**: Closer to age cutoff.
* Come out to my parents. Explain why I want an HPV vaccine. **Con**: Am I ready to come out yet?
* Call for an appointment. **Con**: Will probably show up on the insurance record.

I'm all ears, just hold my hand as you tell me :/

I apologize for this wall of text.

So I recently got hooked on the Tinder app and have been chatting up some guys / meeting a few in safe public places. I have stated upfront to many of the guys that I am looking initially for friends but that if something does develop that I would not be opposed to something more casual / committed.

One of the guys I recently went on a date with really hit it off with me and initiated the conversation on Tinder. We talked for maybe a week before meeting and we seemed to really click well / were flirting with each other. So I decided that it would be ok if we met in person.

So when we were trying to decide what to do when we were to meet up, he mentioned that he wanted to go to a musical but I told him that, since seats were expensive, and I am a college student, I could not put down $100+ on seats when it probably wouldn't be the best setting to get to know a guy. So he agreed and we decided to get dinner at an restaurant instead.

Now this is where the real story begins and I will need advice at the end.

So I propose that we go to this restaurant that is farther away than he would like to drive (35-40+ minutes), so he tells and I choose somewhere closer (~10-15 minutes). He picks me up, we go to the restaurant, have a good time, chat a lot and I thought that we really clicked. Afterwards, he decides to drive me to a dessert place (which is 40+ minutes away, which I thought was unusual since he didn't want to drive that far for dinner) so I go, we get dessert, and end up sitting for 1.5 hours in his car in the parking lot talking.

Drive back takes over an hour and for some reason I needed to use the restroom so we stopped at this apartment. We talk for maybe 3 hours and its around 2-3 am. So by this point, I am not sure if he is interested in pursuing anything, so I slyly ask him and he responds ""what do you think?"". So we start becoming intimate and I spend the night but we don't have any anal sex, just oral sex and cuddling and that was ok. I go back the next day and we agree to keep in contact.

Now here is where the confusing stuff starts. Later in the day after I got back, he texts me and says that though he really likes me, he doesn't see us in a serious relationship and apologizes if he lead me on and offers that we stay friends. Now I tell him that I understand that he is a very busy person at the moment (applying for dental school + working 2 jobs + competing in a sport) and that I understand if he doesn't want to develop something because it would be too much time / doesn't want the pressure of making a future decision if a relationship if also involved.

He texts me 2 days later telling me that after thinking about what I said, that he was wanted to ""remain platonic, for now"", which I thought was a reversal of his previous statement that he would not want something romantic to develop. He tells me that he will talk to me the next day.

So the next day I ask him how it's going and he doesn't respond. I ask him later that evening and he tells me that something traumatic happened to him the night before and that he wasn't ready to talk to me, or anyone else. So I apologize for bothering him and proceed to maybe text him 1-2 times a day just telling him that I hope his day goes well / hope he gets better soon. This began on Thursday.

So by Saturday, I text him and ask him that if he wanted me to stop contacting him that all he needs to do is say so and I would stop. He texts me back much quicker than usual (~30 minutes vs. the usually 5-6 hours) saying that it is not like that and that he is going through a rough week. I apologize and tell him that I hope he gets better soon.
This happened on Saturday.

I continue to text him 1-2 times a day, similarly telling him I hope he is having a good day / get better soon. On Monday he begins to talk with me again, albeit not a often as when we were texting on Tinder (I have his # by now) and we probably have our longest conversation in a week and he is much more joking now than earlier in the week. So I keep conversation, trying to still keep my distance until he is ready to talk more.

By Tuesday (almost a week after he told me something tragic happened to him), I learn that not only did he have food poisoning but also that some tragic event did happen that I did not ask about, since I didn't think it was my right to know.

Now, he told me he needed to talk to me the week prior after he told me we should remain platonic for now, but since he got sick / tragedy arose, I understood why he would have put off talking to me. However, since I don't know where he stood about what would happen, if anything between us, I didn't know what to believe. Some of my friends said that he was playing me, others said that if he was playing me, he could have easily gotten sex on the 1st date and been done with it but he didn't.

So I asked him if we could meet face to face when he had time since I wanted to talk about things. I didn't think that this was too demanding of him.

So my question is: was / is this guy interested in me? Am I being too clingy texting him 1-2 a day or is this ok? Is he trying to let me down easy without hurting me and doesn't want to say so? What should I do? Should I stop talking to him, wait for him to come to me, or continue to try to meet up? I know that my version of the story is biased / it's hard to convey in writing. But I would like any advice that can be given.

Note: I am very new to dating so I don't have a lot of experience understanding guys motives / actions when it comes to expressing interest in dating and I don't generally know the best etiquette for contacting a date after having a good time.

Thanks for your advice!

Edit #1: Thanks to everyone for your advice! I think I am in a much better place now and will not contact him and wait and see if he responds. If he doesn't in a few days, I'll delete his number and move on and hopefully learn from your advice / lessons.

I know that my version of the story is biased / it&amp;#39;s hard to convey in writing. But I would like any advice that can be given.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: I am very new to dating so I don&amp;#39;t have a lot of experience understanding guys motives / actions when it comes to expressing interest in dating and I don&amp;#39;t generally know the best etiquette for contacting a date after having a good time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your advice!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit #1: Thanks to everyone for your advice! I think I am in a much better place now and will not contact him and wait and see if he responds. If he doesn&amp;#39;t in a few days, I&amp;#39;ll delete his number and move on and hopefully learn from your advice / lessons.&lt;/p&gt;
