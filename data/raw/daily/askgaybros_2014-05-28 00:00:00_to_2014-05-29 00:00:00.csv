I moved to Chicago about 8 months ago with my best friend, a girl who confidently identifies as a lesbian. Since moving here, we've put ourselves out there, socialized regularly, and established a rather large group of acquaintances and friends. A majority of these group is gay men, and my friend often feels alienated and like she doesn't quite fit in, simply because she is a lesbian. I know that this is a confirmation bias to some extent, but I also can't pretend to know that I 100% understand how she feels.

I've reaffirmed to her that she has a beautiful personality and people love her and love spending time with her. People genuinely find her hilarious and fun to be around. The fact that she has surrounded herself with almost primarily gay men has really gotten to her, and she feels like Chicago isn't ""right"" for her.

While I can never understand her experience as a gay woman completely (I compare it to my straight male friends never entirely being able to fully understand my experience as a gay man), I continually do my best to help understand and listen. She genuinely feels like there is 1 lesbian for every 200 gay men in this city, and I don't blame her. Gay men are very visible in this town, and the same can't be necessarily said for gay women, at least in the areas we most often find ourselves.

I do know that Boystown is a very gay male-centric atmosphere, and that continuing to go there will only continue to make her feel isolated and alone. Ever since one of our conversations several months ago, we've made an extensive effort to explore new areas of the city and not limit ourselves to Boystown. In exploring more lesbian spaces, she now is self-conscious that she is in these spaces with a ""big group of dudes,"" and doesn't know how to approach lesbians who are often in groups of 5 or more. I can't say that I wouldn't be intimidated by that either.

She has struggled with depression for several years, and she does put on a brave face for 95% of the time, but every few weeks has a breakdown and reaffirms her unhappiness in a not-so-pleasant way. I know professional help is in order, but she refuses to believe that that can help and that anyone can understand how she feels. This seems like a textbook ""helpless"" symptom of depression.

Here's where I need help:

(1) How do I convince a depressed person to seek professional help when she denies that it will help her? Are there any LGBT-specific therapists in the Chicago area that anyone can recommend? Short of staging some sort of intervention, I don't know how I can get her to talk to a professional.

(2) How do I help her find lesbians? I don't have the greatest familiarity with lesbian spaces how to integrate into those circles. It does seem that lesbians seem to socialize much differently than gay men, and I can't quite put my finger on it. Does anyone live in Chicago and have a lesbian friend in a similar situation? Let's meet up.

Thanks in advance for all of your input!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m hoping there&amp;#39;s at least one other person on the internet who knows and/or befriends lesbians.&lt;/p&gt;

Tony and I spent some time discussing everything and I was quite surprised at the solution he proposed. He says that he feels bad for letting it come to this, and that he is sorry for making the revelation awkward. The conversation got pretty deep pretty quickly...

Tony and I started reminiscing from the very beginning when we met in 9th grade. I remember seeing him for the first time and it was lust at first sight... 

I never even thought he would talk to me, being the ""fat and ugly"" kid as I was teased growing up, but when I approached him and heard that he was listening to [my favorite song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yvGCAvOAfM&amp;feature=kp) at the time, and I insisted that we should hang out and exchange music sometimes. We hang out as homies for a few months and ended up skipping a lot of school days to hang out at his house. One evening his parents cooked us dinner then they went out to the movies. We were hanging out alone later that evening, playing Tekken 5 (haha) when suddenly we ended up in a makeout session... then the inevitable... we were both shocked! So here we were, two hormone raged 15 year olds going at it. Tony is only the second person I've ever had sex with, while I was his first.

After that happened, we talked about how we should keep this a secret because of our cultures and fear of family rejection (we're both from Carribbean island where homosexuality is punishable.) So we agreed and have always just kept it at that. We had mutual ""classmate friends"" but no one knew that we hang out so much outside of school too. We were both in the [IB Program](http://www.ibo.org/) so between all the school work most people didn't find time to socialize outside of classes. 

Anywho, we seriously just never talked about it beyond that, and we never had any issue with our situation, and never discussed it further. We just kept up the FB status while still hanging out in high school. In college, he went the ""party frat boy"" route while I went the ""nerd programmer"" route so the friendship part just kinda fell apart due to our new groups of friends. We still hooked up several nights out of the week but never really talked outside of that. Still no issues though. After graduation, he got a great job offer in Oregon and told me he'd still be visiting about once per month. Still no issues. 

For about a year this all worked out fine, until yesterday when he came to visit and I saw the wedding band. We spent today together and talked about the situation. Here's the shocker... Tony has been madly in love with me since 9th grade. I felt like I was reading a reddit post when he told me how scared he has been for holding back these feelings, and how scared he is to tell his family. The visits were never for work, he only came to see me and made up other reasons to be here so as to keep things discreet. **He wants to tell his wife everything.** He wants to tell her about our 9 year fling and that he has feelings for me. He wants to handle the situation very amicably and just get past this and get it off his chest. He even called his parents (who have always seemed to love me) and told them everything about us today. 

Can I just pause here and say **wtf, reddit?**

I really do like Tony and I think he is a sweet guy. We have been nothing but sweet to each other and friendly and caring since the first day we met. I am still in shock that I'm even a part of this, and that he professed his love for me. 

I asked him to take another few days and think about everything. I certainly need time to process. I guess I'll update you guys after we talk some more... and I am still very sorry that I am in the middle of this.

**TL;DR** - I found out that my FB of 9 years is now married and has a kid. I questioned if we should continue and he broke down with the truth... he has always had feelings for me and would rather risk losing his wife than to lose me.

I kept losing my position with the toy and eventually had to finish by jerking off, finishing with a sub-par orgasm. Is there a better position than being on my back? Should i get hard before I start? This is the best subreddit I could think of for the question. Could you help me out?&lt;/p&gt;

If you can't be bothered reading the thread, just know that I met a cool (bottom) guy and we've been dating for a couple of months now.

The following is a follow-up to the last thread, which some of you might like to read. Otherwise, you can skip to the question at hand and just address that. A big thank you to the guys who are/were supportive of me, and an apologies to John2Nohj, who I probably should have listened to but didn't. Oh well, we fall so we can learn to pick ourselves back up or some shit like that.

Our relationship is essentially long-distance. Even though I'm in two locations on either side of Melbourne, it's never close to him, so essentially we only see each other once a week, and since he lives at home with his somewhat-disapproving parents he can't have me over and mine is ""too far"" (an hour) to drive to. He occasionally comes down to near where I am for work for a few days but this is once every couple of months. The last time was when we had just started dating.

We haven't had sex yet and this has begun to adversely affect the relationship. You may remember that he asked if we wanted to go exclusive very early on in the relationship, which I was more than happy to do because I don't really get a lot of action anyway since I live in some very small/close-minded towns ~~where people do not appreciate my hotness~~. Two weeks ago he called me up and tells me that he's struggling to fight his temptations and that he wants to go open again because he's not at a stage with me where he feels he only wants me (heavily paraphrased). 

Naturally I was hurt, but in many ways I can see where he's coming from and initially told him I couldn't agree to it because I wouldn't be able to handle it. A few days later I came around and decided that maybe it wasn't such a bad idea given that I'm a virgin (lol) and haven't really had a chance to explore myself yet. So last week we had a nice long chat about the whole thing and we agreed that we'd moved the relationship along far too quickly and that half the problem is our differing attitudes towards sex. He seems to be legitimately worried that I might turn out to be a bottom as well, which in hindsight is not very fair because he has never really asked me about what I want to do. He came up with a lot of other stuff (e.g. ""you're too young to be looking for a relationship"") which sounded reasonable at the time but on further consideration sound like excuses so that he doesn't feel as bad about screwing other guys.

This isn't really the issue that I wanted to address though--it's all old news to me. I knew that he was a super horny guy, I knew that he was slow on the relationship side of things and I knew that he was very cynical of guys like me who actually still believe in romance--but what do I know? I'm only 21. Apparently. I'm still into him despite all this, but I have had to learn very quickly that the dating scene is kind of shitty in this regard. I don't want to break up with him (yet), and there's no love lost--it doesn't actually change the way we do things since I still see him the same amount and we still like each other. It's weird. We have such respect for each other that even if we did break up we'd have no choice but to stay friends because we get along so damn well. At this point we're like FWB, but... emotionally? Relationships, as I was continually warned, are much more complex than I'd previously thought. I digress.

**Now, here's my problem.** I want to give the whole hooking up thing a try. I have always insisted that it wasn't for me but fuck it, if we're in an open relationship I might as well. I have issues, though--I actually find the whole process of ""I'm horny, wanna fuck?"" a massive... turn-off. Unless the guy is insanely hot, if that happens I instantly lose interest. It's as if suddenly it's too easy, and there's no challenge. I don't have to work for anything and that really just kills it for me. There's no build-up, no tension, and I can't think of anything more boring that that. I'ave realised that for me, at least for the moment, sexual attraction is something that grows after getting to know someone a little bit better. Even with my boyfriend it began with a more emotional attraction and I didn't really want to fuck him until quite a few weeks in, which led to some, er, ""physiological"" problems on my end when we tried to after our second date. I always thought that it was me being sentimental and overly romantic but what if it turns out that that is what gets me going?

Is anyone else like this? Am I just the weird guy who literally has to date people to get hard? I have to, at some point, bring this up with my boyfriend because we agreed that our openness should only extend as far as physical, but what happens if I can't fuck unless I go on a few dates with the guy? Could it be called cheating, in that sense? What about the guy I'm stringing along, then? Should I tell them that I'm not interested in a relationship even if I go on dates with them? That doesn't seem fair to other people and in some ways it feels like I'm just doing this to get back at my own boyfriend which makes me feel like a shitty person.

I feel like that is where our relationship is heading but it's hard for me to tell if he feels the same.
