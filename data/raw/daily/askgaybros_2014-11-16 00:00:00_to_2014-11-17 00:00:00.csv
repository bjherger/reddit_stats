So here's the deal. I have a friend, lets call him Joe, who is about 22 years old, never been with a boy or girl, and he is questioning his sexuality. A few weeks ago, before I knew he was questioning, I confessed to him that I had a crush and proposed we get to know each other more. Unfortunately his prompt response was to put me in the friend-zone. 

Such is life.

But I digress. Onto how I learned about his questioning of himself. A mutual acquaintance that we both worked with at one time ""randomly"" decided ask him flat out if he was gay the other night. I use the word ""randomly"" loosely because this guy, who is an ignorant ass, likes to meddle. In fact, a year ago he thought it was appropriate to ask me, a gay male, to find out if Joe was gay and then tell him once I knew. Of course i told him to go fuck himself because I'd already known him long enough to know that he at one time tried to convert a mutual gay friend straight

Needless to say, I don't like this guy, but again, I digress.

So Gus, the name I'm using to refer to said acquaintance, asks Joe if he is gay via text, and Joe, who I mistakenly thought was smarter than to trust this douche, told him that he had never been with anyone and was confused, feeling that he needed to try both before he knew which he preferred. He ended the confession by asking Gus not to tell anyone, little did he know that Gus was at our work speaking to another mutual friend and the first thing he did after getting his answer was spill the beans. Said friend, who is my best friend and knows how much I like Joe and that I confessed feelings for him recently, immediately informed me of the admission and all the details that led to it. 

MY conflict is this: I feel like Joe has a right to know that other people know about his secret, but I'm worried that the timing of my confession of feelings to him and the subsequent questioning of his sexuality are so close that he may think I had something to do with it all. This would be particularly bad since for me since, now that I know he is a little into guys, I'm kinda hoping that in the future I might fight my way out of the Friend-Zone (I know. fat chance, right).  
He knows that I'm definitely not Gus's biggest fan, but it is just insanely coincidental that just one week after I ask him out, someone that both of us know would ask him if he is gay. I feel like that makes it seem as though I was talking to Gus about my feelings and put him up to finding out which isn't the case at all. I haven't spoken to Gus in months because I can't stand the guy.

On the other hand I know that, for me at least, outing someone in the lgbtq community on terms other than their own is an unforgivable crime. **No one** should have that power taken away from them. **No one** should be pushed from the closet before they are ready, and so I feel that he has a right to know that someone is doing exactly that.  
Am I right? Should I tell him? And if I do, does that make things look bad on me? The friend-zone thing is a joke. He wants to be just friends and that's fine I'll get over it, but I feel that if he thinks I had something to do with his outing in some '6 Degrees' kind of way, he won't even want to be friends any more.  
What do you guys suggest I do?

**TL;DR:** Someone who recently friend-zoned me is being outed. I think he has the right to know but don't want him to think I had something to do with it since it's occurring so shortly after my confession of feelings and the culprit is someone we both know. Do I tell him or do I leave it alone?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Guys!&lt;/p&gt;

met him a few years ago. fell in love. still love him. we moved in together. i had a drinking problem and no direction in life. he got me sober and helped me finsih school. my family was/and is forever graeffteful to him for that. they love him. so do i. 

but i met this other guy back in februrary. he was an idiot. but he got me to mess around with him. i don't blame him though. i've taken full responsbility for my own actions. anyway. we messed around a bunch of times. there was no emotional connection. it was purely sexual, which i thought my bf would understand if he ever found out.. but he didn't. he never let me explain.

i literally haven't spoken to him since the dayhe found out. you guys here told me that it was all my fault and I agree. it is all my fault. and i still feel guilty about it all. and you all told me there was nothing i could do. and that hurt me so much.

last week, i found out that my ex moved to new york city a few days after halloween. it was always his dream to move there. 'm happy for him, but i had imagined us moved there together. but i am happy for him. and i know i'll never have him back. he's living his dream and here i am at home alone. crying and drinkin.

he cut me off completely when he found out. the last worst i said to him was ""let me explain"", but i couldn't because our friends kept me from getting into the apartment. i never got to explai an anything .f

so let me explain here: he was my world. he was perfect. and i thought I could find someone to satsify me in bed elsewhere. my bf was a bottom, but he never let me do any of the thigns i wanted to do. he found certain things ""demoralizing"" but hey turned me on. and so i found ayounger guy who would let me call the shots in bed. and i took it too far.

i'll never fogive myself for this. he brought order to my lif.e. he took care of me. but I thew it all away. and now he's out there in nyc living his life and it brings me to tears how happy i am for him. but i miss him too. and i know he deserves someone who'll never cheat on him and i hopehe finds that guy some day, but man, i miss him so much.

and i've started drinking again and my brother kicked me out of his house because of it. and the one guy who was my core is no longer there.

 a few weeks ago, iw anted to kill myself. i was mostly depressed because I relapsed and started drinking again, but also because my guy. MY guy was gone. and i knew i fucked up so badly and there was no fixing it.

anyway, i've gotten enough hate from you guys. i know i fucked up. i know I was fully to blame, bu

I found /r/gaybros around this time and it quickly became one of my favorite subs. 

At 21 I realized I was transgender. After months of confusion and hating myself I 
started taking testosterone blockers and estrogen. If I could pick and choose the effects of hormones I would, but that's not the way it works. For example boobs and the sexual side effects are unpleasant for me. It's worth it for me though. Honestly I have no idea WTF I'm doing I'm trying to make the best decision with what I know at the time. 

At this point I identify as non-binary which for me personally means that I feel gender fluid. Some days I dress more woman, some days more man; with all sorts of variations and combinations. I would LOVE to just be one or the other. But I get dysphoria (a state of unease) about myself and my body if I put myself in a box. It can be really difficult, even more so with shitty people who make nasty comments. 

I don't hold it against guys who aren't attracted to me. I'm not really a gay guy anymore even if I dress as a man or have facial hair. But I would like to continue to be a part of gaybros and I wanted to see how people felt about that. Thanks for reading.

I can say I am in that situation right now, though it is mostly venting and letting some things off my chest. 

First of all, some background. It took me a while, but I've finally started coming out to people close to me, and correcting people when they assume I'm straight - I am bi. 26, getting a PhD in Chemical Engineering, mostly keeping to myself, usually my perfect night is reading a book and drinking hot cocoa. I've been with guys before in kink parties, but never had actual msm sex - or more specifically, never topped nor bottom. Anyways, most of these situations have been meeting with people with the purpose of the party, nothing beyond that. Also, clean, check every three months even when I haven't done anything (last time I had any sort of hook up was in May, and yet I still go every three months, god bless student insurance). 

However, this has made me very, VERY inexperienced in the dating department. And while I haven't had a problem with it before... I've been fancying someone for the past three months. New student in the department, gorgeous (and I mean REALLY GORGEOUS), funny, nice, cultured, I mean, the whole deal. He's gay - he's on Grindr and his instagrams he tags all his pictures with instagay so no doubt about that. I think I started crushing on him when I met him during the welcome hike we do in the department (Colorado, so it's like mandatory to hike around). 

So, what's the problem? Well, I don't know how to talk to him, how to approach him, and when I try, I panic. No, really - just yesterday he was sitting alone in the cafeteria doing homework, so I had the perfect moment and segue to just go talk to him and ask him about his homework and all that and... I panicked. I ran back to my laboratory (which, with a broken foot, looks funny). I know I shouldn't be afraid of talking to him since he's actually a nice guy, he even says hi when I say hi if we run each other in the hallway, and even smiles when he does so. 

I know part of the reason why I panic is because well, I've never had dates with guys before - even on grindr I am mostly to meet people and network, but this is the first time I've wanted to get to know someone in that matter. I know another part of the panic is the fact that I feel, well, inexperienced in all the aspects of being gay (read sex), while he is very well out and about. 

I even know what's the problematic portion of my thoughts - why should I care how experienced I am or he is, if all I want to do is get to know him, right? Well, like I said, I'm behaving like a high school kid with a crush. 

I feel like banging my head against the desk or something. 

TL;DR: Cute guy in the department, me crushing on him, I don't know how to approach him, end product is me acting like a high schooler with a crush.

I'm 22 and fresh out the closet (still not out to my family, but close friends know and I'm much more comfortable with myself). That means I'm now dating, which is great since I've never been in a relationship before.

A couple of months ago, I met a great guy at a bar. At first, I was a little uncomfortable and worried about getting too serious, but now I'm really really into him and the relationship and I was pretty happy until recently. We've been on a few dates in the past couple of months and everything seemed to be going great, except recently I've been sensing some distance. Last week, I texted him to make plans and he didn't respond, like at all. I tried calling, no answer. So I figure he's busy, it's ok, and I chill out with the messages for a bit.

The next day, I get some good news so I want to tell him about it, and he finally texts back saying ""that's great,"" or something terse, and completely ignores the question I asked him the day before about making plans. Again silence for a couple of days, he won't initiate communication, it's all me. I haven't been obsessively calling and texting, just once a day and if he doesn't respond, I just wait, but sometimes I get nothing in return.

Now, I really like this guy and it's my first relationship and we agreed to be ""boyfriends"" a couple weeks ago and everything was going great prior to this silent treatment, but I'm so frustrated. I don't want this to end, but I also don't like that he's been ignoring me like this for the past week. I'm a little worried he wants to end it by just ignoring me, and that's not really fair. I'm just totally confused. Has anyone had a similar experience?

TL; DR: first relationship with a guy, everything seemed to be going great, but he's been ignoring my texts and calls recently, is it over? Is there anything I can do?

I&amp;#39;m a little worried he wants to end it by just ignoring me, and that&amp;#39;s not really fair. I&amp;#39;m just totally confused. Has anyone had a similar experience?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL; DR: first relationship with a guy, everything seemed to be going great, but he&amp;#39;s been ignoring my texts and calls recently, is it over? Is there anything I can do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit&lt;/strong&gt; Thanks for the responses. Now I feel really dumb and sad, but I&amp;#39;m sure it&amp;#39;ll pass eventually.&lt;/p&gt;

Pretty sure I have no gaydar after avoiding every single guys gaze for the past decade or so of my life, so I have no idea how to tell who is looking and who is 'looking'.

And before you suggest going to gay bars, there is only 1 in my city and as far as I know it's extremely camp, not what I'm into at all.

I just feel at a loss, and a bit confused as to why there seem to be so few many gay guys on these dating apps when my city is quite large.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I only came out late june/early july, but I&amp;#39;ve literally had no luck finding anybody.

After months of procrastinating I finally said something to my GP about my mental health. I still have to go back and discuss it (and some test results) with her at length, but I'm still fairly oblivious about it all and I'd appreciate some feedback. 

She gave me the choice of (a) antidepressants, (b) a referral for a psychologist or (c) doing a 'mental health care plan' with her. The last option doesn't seem like it's worth it for a few reasons, so it basically comes down to therapy versus antidepressants... though I still have some reservations about each of those as well.  

Since I have a blood test on Monday to see what my brain's up to, this might be a moot point since I might end up needing medication anyway. Overall, I'd prefer the medication since it's easier, but I seriously doubt it'll solve any of my problems (which are numerous) and it could have unwanted side effects. On the other hand, therapy is expensive and I have a lot of trouble with speaking clearly and expressing myself. I could barely accurately describe the symptoms of my cold to my GP, so I don't know how I'd begin describing my list of inner grievances with a stranger (or if it'd even help).

I'm still not sure how I feel about the whole thing. I felt a bit invalidated by my GP when she immediately jumped onto self-harm (which, while I do think about it occasionally, I don't rate as a big problem) and gave me the number for a crisis hotline instead of following up or giving feedback on my description of my mental state. Can't a guy have mental health issues without cutting himself? She went into more detail about my cough / allergy medication.
