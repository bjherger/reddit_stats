So there is this older gay guy I was talking to on Grindr. He was very, very close to me distance wise so he had to be in my parents neighborhood (in the suburbs). We started talking and he mentioned he was married and had several kids, I told him I don't mess around with guy who are partnered unless their partner is okay with it. His wasn't but we kept talking because it seemed like he needed a friend. 

He told me he came out to his wife ten years ago but she wouldn't let him leave, but after ten years he has finally worked up the courage to file for divorce. What sort of advice and support can I give him? What are some good resources for him/his wife/his kids? My instinct says to let it run its course but he has no other gay friends and will be fighting an uphill battle with his family and could use some support. So if you have been through a similar experience I would love to hear from you. He is much older as well, I am 25 he is 47. 

tl;dr - An older friend is coming out and going through a straight divorce, how can I be supportive. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey! &lt;/p&gt;

It was great, but I eventually put an end to it because even though he was a wonderful guy, I just didn’t find the male body all that attractive and he was looking for a more serious relationship. 

   I’ll speak plainly; I don’t really find the appeal of being penetrated, nor does penetrating a guy measure up to vaginal intercourse for me. It’s not bad or a turn off, but I find myself more attracted to women physically. 

   But all these years later, and numerous years of dating, sex, and a few longer relationships and it still counts as the greatest relationship I have ever had. He is by far the most caring and empathetic person I have ever met and I feel that I really do love him. I did then, and I do now. I suppressed this feeling for years over my dismissal of sex, but as I’ve gotten older I realize there is way more to a healthy relationship than just sex. 

   I just have not been able to find anything like that with women as I have the exact opposite issue with my heterosexual relationships. I find women physically attractive and enjoy sex, but I just cannot bring myself to get emotionally invested. I don’t know why, and I’ve spent years trying to figure it out.

   This brings us to now. The guy I mentioned is still around, and we are still close friends. I still feel that I love him and our relationship was great, and recently he has said the same to me. I suddenly realize I want this; I want him. I don’t find men in general attractive, just him. I admitted this to him and we talked for a while and he also admitted that he has not found a good long-term relationship either because he is still in love with me. 

   I eventually put forward the idea of starting a real relationship and he is allowing me some time and space to figure this out. I really want this to work but I know denying him sex over my fickleness isn’t going to work out in the long term. I admit I am also quite uncomfortable with the idea of being openly gay, which is going to have to happen to make this work. 

   Writing this out helps, but I am wondering if there is anyone else out there that has felt the way I do about a particular person and if you were able to overcome your sexual peculiars for them? How did your relationship end up?

I'm 24, gay, and a pretty well rounded individual. I have dated a few guys here and there and had one serious LTR from 17- 19.
I never really ""got"" social networking and although I have few people really close to me, and I think they they use Facebook..I just don't see the point in FB/Twitter/Instagram whatever. I have only heard bad things about it and I don't have that many people to keep in touch with just a few close friends. I have family abroad but they're elderly and simple and wouldn't know how to use anything more advanced than a touch-tone phone.
I just got an smartphone for the first time in January and it's cool to be able to do GPS and computer without using a GPS or Computer. I have also been wanting to meet someone so I downloaded some of those apps like Growlr, and OkCupid (deleted Grindr because I'm not skinny and hairless and felt uncomfortable) and I have been talking to some guys, and hit it off. We exchanged numbers and they will text me or whatever, but I don't really like doing anything more than simple conversations via text so my standard answer is: Hey man, I really don't like to text it's too impersonal so if you wanna get to know each other better give me a call.

Most of the time I will either get a call, or a positive response like ""right know I'm on the bus but I'll call you when I get home."" But in the past week I have had 4 guys tell me that it is wierd or creepy that I want to talk on the phone without knowing them. My thoughts are that, I wanted to talk to you because I WOULD LIKE TO GET TO KNOW THEM, that's the point. It's a lot easy to form a connection with ion someone when you hear their voice as opposed to just words on a screen. And I also don't like the long drawn out text conversations all day. It's easier for me to just call someone after dinner and chat for 10 minutes or whatever then to be in constant contact all day.
Also, I've got the creep thing because I don't use social networking. I was called wierd and accused of having something to hide and antisocial. I'm not antisocial at all but I guess I'm old school. My process with a guy is more like ""let's have a chat for a few and see if we are compatible"" and if that works out let's get coffee tomorrow after work/school and see if we click in person. Whereas, it seems most guys (even LTR oriented guys) seem to want to just add you on social networking, text throughout the day and then maybe come over or something after texting for a week. That sounds like a drawn out waste of time and terribly antisocial to me. 
I have a gut feeling that wanting to talk on the phone and get coffee is more ""normal"" than having texting chats and tumblring and twittering each other anyways. I am not going to change but I wouldike to know if you think I am wierd, and would be turned off/scared. I live in Queens if that matters and usually only try to talk with guys around my age (18-30)

Tonight I came out to one of my best friends, and it was pretty terrifying. I wasn't sure how he would react, but he ended up responding with ""a lot of people around me turn gay. Must be my ridiculously good looks."" I laughed my ass off and was glad that he answered in his own classic fashion. I told him I hope nothing changes, because he's one of my best friends and it would suck if anything bad happened, and he said he feels similarly and would say the same thing (again, a great response! He's NEVER emotional, so I was surprised to hear that).

However, after our conversation I feel.....embarrassed? Guilty, maybe? I started thinking about it and I think I feel kind of...""lesser,"" or ashamed about being gay, which clearly is a HUGE red flag. It's very difficult at times for me to admit I'm gay, and I get VERY worried about people treating me differently or reacting to me in some way. Or thinking that I'm going to hit on them automatically. And maybe they will automatically think of me as effeminate? Not that there is anything wrong with that--it's just not me.

How do I get over this? Is this all internalized homophobia? I was raised Catholic in Texas, so it wasn't the most friendly place.

The other thing is, although I've never gotten a boner from a girl that I can recall, I still somehow think that MAYBE someday I'll just be straight. Even though I know it's probably not true. I do think if I found the right guy though that I would be ALL over him.

I got injured at work a while back and have been going to physical therapy for a few weeks (nothing serious!) and at one point my therapist told me i could have my wife help me with the exercises. I didn't think anything of it and just corrected her. Shortly after this interaction, she very awkwardly tells me that she thinks marriage is between a man and a woman and that 'absolute relativism' has taken over and no one has morals any more. 
I didn't really know what to do other than to tell her that I was glad that people didn't agree with her any more and that her comments were demeaning and belittling. She used the rest of the appointment to grill me on why I didn't believe in jesus. I tried to change the subject but it was impossible. I only have another week or two of pt and i dont want to prolong it by rescheduling but the more i think about what happened the more it upsets me in a really deep way. 

does anyone have similar experiences like this? I hated that i felt so powerless but all i could do was continue to be polite to this person who was disregarding the most sacred relationship in my life


for anyone wondering, im a longtime lurker who has never made an account... never knew how easy it was
anyway any comments or anything are really appreciated



EDIT:

a lot of people are asking if its a private practice, im pretty sure that it is an outpatient facility connected with the hospital, it has the same name. it might be run by a private physician though,im not really sure how things like that are run. 

i did end up calling and asking for a new therapist and asked who i could speak to to file a complaint. they scheduled me with someone more in charge than her (seems like she might be a stand in while one of the physicians is on vacation). I spent way too much time agonizing over this and i had a way worse reaction to it than i expected to. i definitely feel like i made the right decision in speaking up and i really appreciate what everyone had to say, it helped me put it in perspective.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;a little backstory: from pennsylvania, got married when the ban was overturned. we&amp;#39;re both ~25&lt;/p&gt;

Afterwards it was just about babysitting,  making sure he wasn't hooking up with guys without telling them. He had lost all care for his well being and others. As a group we tried to brave the storm. but we had just buried one and had not even mourned him. After constant negotiations, arguments, even fights. One by one we started walking away.

So after meeting and hanging out with him and my old roommate as a group for like a week, and me texting him but him never really initiating the texts, he went away for 3 weeks for work.  I only texted twice during that whole time period and they were short and for legitimate reasons, and not too pushy. 

So the question is...I know he's back in town and it's a matter of days before I go over to hang out with my old roommate and inevitably he will be there.  What's the play here?

I have two somewhat related problems: I have enormous difficulty relating to and connecting with other gay men, and despite not being closetted, my romantic life remains pretty much totally separated from my normal social, academic, and professional life.

Some background: I've been in two actual relationships with guys, neither of which were widespread public knowledge (in both cases, by their choice, not mine). Most - actually, all - of my good friends nowadays are straight men, who know that I'm gay; in fact, most of them are more willing to talk about my sex life than I am. 

My problem is that I identify with, enjoy the company of, and (to be totally honest) am more attracted to my straight friends than any gay man I've ever met - and a lot of straight men I know (but obviously not my close friends) would be a lot less willing to maintain a friendship with me if they knew I was gay. So, I'd rather keep my sexuality to myself and miss out on the million-to-one chance of a relationship than roll the dice and ruin friendships.

Some disclaimers; I have a terrible gaydar, so I tend to assume a guy is straight unless his hair is dyed every color in the ROYGBIV spectrum, and concequently I'm very hesitant to engage anyone romantically outside of something like Grindr. As far as I can see, there are two different tacks for approaching this: I could become more open to flirting with people I'm not 100% sure are gay, or I could try to modify my preferences so I enjoy the company of ""gay-er"" men.

I have no clue how to do either of these things. Help?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is basically a two-part question.

Sorry for the novel. So I'm a self-proclaimed hypochondriac and a naturally anxious person so this may just be me overreacting, but I'd love to get some advice. So I met a guy and we went out on a date. Long story short, we had sex and in the heat of the moment, I didn't put a condom on (I topped). I know that that's stupid, and in the future I will definitely be more careful. Now, I'm trying to weigh the pros and cons of PEP in my mind to see if I should start treatment or not. I am still within the 72 hour window. I know topping is lower risk, and additionally (this may be the only time I'm thankful for my performance anxiety) I didn't top him for very long because I couldn't keep it up. I'd estimate no more than 3-4 minutes of unprotected topping before we just gave up and blew each other instead. I also asked him his status and he said he's negative, but has had unprotected sex with one guy since his last test, but said that the guy he had unprotected sex with also said he was negative. He also agreed to get tested but can't go until tomorrow. I know that he or the other guy he had sex with could all be lying so I'm taking that with a grain of salt. So overall, I think that my brief unprotected insertive anal sex with a self-reported negative partner is pretty low risk overall, but I would really be devastated if I turned up positive in a couple months when I knew I could have gotten PEP within the 72 hour window. The downsides of getting PEP for me though is that it's expensive and I can't afford it without insurance and I'm on my parents' insurance plan...and they don't know that I'm gay. Furthermore, unfortunately I know that they wouldn't support me being gay and if they found out this way I have absolutely no clue how they would react. And I've also heard that PEP side effects can be pretty bad. So, really any advice or words of encouragement anyone has would be really helpful. Thanks for taking the time to read bros!
