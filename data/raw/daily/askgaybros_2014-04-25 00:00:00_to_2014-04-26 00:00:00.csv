Meet him (call him V) in January 2014, both instantly fall in love, have this awesome honeymoon period, everything about us complements each other. Our preferences, choices, plans for life co-incide miraculously. 
2. March 15th, his straight roommate (call him A) walks in on us. This roommate has been pesky throughout and would call him on every one of our dates. And since we're in India and in the closet, he'd have to come up with an excuse. This time he tries to handle it and somehow convinces that we were just hanging out.
3. March 21st - he tells me that his roommate (who he shares a bed with - which is common among straight guys in India) is gay, and is his ex boyfriend - FOR FOUR YEARS (while we haven’t even been together for three months). And even though they haven't had sex in like a year, they stay together like best friends. I'm shocked and tell him he has to leave him instantly or we're off. He asks if I'd accept him completely if he leaves his ex. I say I'll let him know later. He says he can't leave him right now, needs time. Effectively leaves me. The most painful few days of my life follow. Can’t sleep can’t eat can’t think can’t work.
4. March 24th - Meets me at my work and says he’d like us to be together soon. Says he loves me only, but his ex needs to be eased out of his hard situation. I say the ex has to leave the same day, or we're off. Again he says he's sorry, but his ex needs his support at the moment. So rejects me. 
5. Mar 28th - A (his ex) calls and asks if I'll accept V once they separate, then he'll leave us alone. I give no answer.  
6. March 29th - V says A has left. And that he's feeling really sad. Messages me - ""I know I caused you to cry so much, I'll be with you forever."" I go to him the same night, we fuck but immediately after that I feel anger and pain. I distance myself, don't let him touch me, he tries to assuage me, but I can’t get myself to even look at him. This goes on till morning while I'm distancing myself and he soon stops trying to physically draw me back. By morning we begin to talk and I ask what he's feeling. He starts crying about how insensitive he's been TO HIS EX in the past few weeks. We try fucking again but he says his rear feels like it's burning so let's just help each other without anal. Goes to the toilet to wash, stays there for half an hour, presumably to talk to his ex. Later admits that he didn’t let me fuck him again because he didn’t want to have sex. By afternoon he says he’ll make a decision.  Will let me know by evening. (after ""I'll be with you forever just the previous day""). 
7. Brings him back the same day. Tells me he'll get back together with A. I'm devastated again. Now I couldn't work the whole of last week.. I'm new on the job and still on my probation.
8. I request him to meet the next day. (I'm still ashamed of that) He comes. We talk. He says he loves me only and his ex and him just kissed when they met but didn't do anything else. Two days after that we meet again and make love and he says he'll get back to me. 
9. The next day doesn't message much. The day after, ignores my calls. On forcing a meeting. We talk for an hour, where I practically beg him to get back together. **BTW his ex is older, his first boyfriend, used to cheat on him, tried to get married to a girl once, leaving him for the dead but it didn't work out**. I explain how made for each other we are. For the first time rejects me on my face.
10. This time I decide it's over. I call old fuck buddy home the same night. The next few days are hard again, but better than before. Since for the first time he broke up on my face, so I felt a form of closure and feel he's unworthy of being loved the way I loved him.
11. Aprils 8th: Two days after that he requests to meet. For the first time I yell at him .. tell him what a piece of shit he is, and explain how much I loved him. **He hasn't yet apologized properly.
12. April 12th: I’m less of a zombie in the office. Trying to salvage the lack of productivity off late. Slowly I'm beginning to feel like I may be able to live without him. He asks to meet again. Says he’ll ask A to leave. This time he’s sure this is what he wants.
13. April 14th: Says A has left. Wants to meet. I say okay let’s meet. In the evening calls off the meeting, saying he has to work late.  The next day doesn’t contact. When I call, says his grandpa expired so he had to leave. Doesn’t even have the courtesy to message me when he knew I was waiting for his message. (this is kinda typical of him lately, waits for me to be compelled to message him). Says he’ll message the next day. Doesn’t. I call the next day and ask who he wants to be with. He says me. Then I ask why don’t you contact. He says “I thought you’d be at work. Was gonna later.”. 
14. April 15-25: We have been talking on the phone and messaging, he was supposed to come to meet me, but says his dad detained him for his grandfather’s funeral customs. Cancels again. 

I don’t know what to do with this. I still love him (progressively less), but I’ve been hurt tremendously. I lost 6kgs (like 14 pounds) in the past month. I’ve been sleeping like 3 hours a day. I used to sleep at least 8 earlier. I don’t know if he’ll change his decision. He’s not apologized in person properly. I don’t know if he deserves my complete devotion. I don’t know if I should ask for proof of commitment. I don’t know if I should just break off, which itself will be super hard to do. What should I do?

&lt;p&gt;TL;DRI thought my feeling for my best friend would have died after years of burying them. Since then he&amp;#39;s gotten married. Should I bring it up with him?  &lt;/p&gt;

I'm a college student at UNCC who came out a few months back. My friends all accepted it decently, which I feel blessed for, but sometimes they surprise me.

On first appearance I don't dress any differently than any other bro, with two notable exceptions. I really like flowers in my hair during the summer months, and I like to paint my nails on special occasions. I didn't think this was a big deal, but last week I had a presentation and went for a black suit, dark blue shirt, black tie, and black nail polish to finish the look I was going for. Three of my class mates, and two of my friends later that day all gave me reactions akin to ""What the fuck did you do to your nails????""

I know it's my body and I'm free to decorate it as I choose, but should I expect this kind of resistance to something I consider so trivial? Does it bug any of you guys to see bros in nail polish?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey bros,&lt;/p&gt;

We go out for lunch the other day and as he is swiping through his phone, what do I see? Grindr. ""Well, thats cute"" I think to myself and I mention it. He says it's like porn for me in that he uses it to jack off. I tell him that its not the same, porn requires no interaction, I just watch it, jack off, and Im done. That's an app for hooking up. He tells me he just uses it for friends and because he is just interested in whose on. 

This ended up bugging me all that day, yesterday, and today. I just can't bring myself to trust him now and yesterday I grab his phone for him and theres a text from someone in his phone that isn't a saved number. I don't know his password and I am just not someone to go through someone's phone. Trust is one of the biggest things in the world to me, easily a make it or break thing for me. 

I want to so bad, but I just can't trust him now. What do I do? This isn't just a casual relationship for either of us, we have long been making plans to move in together and really build an awesome life. Am I just being paranoid (though I think I am more than justified) or what?

For the first 2 or 3 months everything was going good but then it all changed. Basically, I've done everything I could to be nice with him (lend money (which was a really bad idea I know), help renovate the house of his aunt (it's where he lives), helped out at his mother's house to stack wood for winter, paid for pretty much everything when we went out, etc.) and when I try to think about what he's done for me, I just can't come up with anything except that he cooked for me on a few occasions ( I paid for the food). My birthday was a month ago and he totally forgot about it and somehow it hurts to know that I've done all those things for him and he can't even think about me for that one day. Ho I should add that I haven't seen him since the weekend before that too, though we talk by messages every day. What I don't understand is that to anyone arround him be it friends or family, he's there and he's the first to offer help but when it comes to me it's just a whole different guy. I do believe him when he says that he care about me but the thing is I think he just believes his own lies. I tried to talk with him a few times but I always get the same answer ''you're assuming things, it's your anxiety that make you think that, etc.'' and I'm getting sick of it. So here is the problem, I don't want to be alone. I just want things to work out but it seems that talking with a wall is gonna get me more answers than talking with him about anything serious. He owes me arround 1000$ and I'm afraid to leave him and never see that money again. I know I was stupid to put myself in that situation in the first place. I just don't know what to do anymore, should I just suck it up and keep hoping things will work out? Or just forget about the money and move on?
