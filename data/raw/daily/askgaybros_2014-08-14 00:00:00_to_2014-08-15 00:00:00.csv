I've always been very insecure about how hairy I am. I'm not even that hairy compared to like bears or something. Just arms, legs, butt...but its kind dense and fairly dark (esp cuz I have pale skin). Peach fuzz on chest. I am so insecure about it that every time before I hook up I feel the need to get rid of it. As you can imagine, this makes things not spontaneous. Also, I'm tired as hell by the time I'm done cleaning my butt hole and shaving every inch of by body. OCD right? I'm also Asian so whenever I do hookup, I feel like the guy pretty much expects me to be completely smooth. Im afraid that he'll be like ""ew wtf, you're so hairy get out""


I don't even know why I'm like this. I think its cuz back in HS, all the cool,popular guys I had crushes on were relatively hairless and the guys I thought were gross were super hairy. Back then body hair used to bother me so much, I couldn't even watch a porn scene if one of the actors had a beard or a mustache or chest hair. 


Now I'm able to find hairy chests and stuff attractive (cuz gay media has decided to bombard the world with images of hairy men as the standard of beauty/masculinity I guess) but I'm still insecure about my own body hair...wtf is wrong with me? I havent worn shorts in like a decade...that's how messed up I am.

Last year, my straight crush at the time heavily encouraged me to watch Good Will Hunting last year with him, because he thought Will Hunting had some resemblance to me. Turns out that I related so much to him that it has been the only movie I've ever legitimately cried through. Not just holding back tears, but full-on sobbing.

Just two months earlier I had come to terms with being gay, and I managed to come out to my best friend a month later despite our busy schedules and long distance. At the time, I was struggling with who I wanted to be and essentially lost the identity I held during high school. I think watching the movie finally got me back on track.

My best friend, when I mentioned this earlier to him, asked, ""What makes it so relatable?""

My brief response: ""A lot of things. First, about being naturally talented and having potential to be great but maybe not the constant motivation and desire to achieve it. Also of pushing people away from me before they have a chance to hurt me and completely abandoning most of the people I knew before college.""

Oddly enough, I instantly saw an analogy of the relationship between Will Hunting and Robin Williams' character, the psychologist, and the relationship between me and my straight crush. Most of our insights came in our early friendship as extended metaphors, and we helped each other with the unique and individual problems we each faced.

From the movie I realized I needed to take more control over my life, and that first meant changing my major so I could work toward the future I wanted. If I wanted to have the best life I could imagine, I thought, I could be the only one to catalyze the process. I also finally made a conscious effort to make myself happy with my personal life, instead of waiting and saying everything will come to me eventually. In short, I strengthened my friendships and took a trip to visit several of them this summer, something I would have never imagined myself doing even a year ago. I was extremely nervous as I had just come out to them a few weeks prior, and had not seen them since. Thankfully, my fears were instantly dissolved. Both of the friends I had newly come out to, including my former straight crush, greeted me with hugs, which I awkwardly accepted.

Along the way, I've been told that I'm funny and a cheerful person to be around, qualities I didn't realize I had until I had a chance to reevaluate myself. The biggest part of figuring out who I wanted to be had to have been discovering various aspects I didn't know about myself.

I haven't been in any relationships before, and before this experience I hadn't done anything even remotely sexual with a guy. 

I've always been a huge sentimentalist at heart, probably to a fault, and have tried in vain to find the ""perfect guy"" for years. But recently I was starting to feel like I've been waiting around for nothing; that I've been stopping myself from having fun/experiences that are healthy and normal. Many of my friends (gay guys) are very sexually active and independent about it, and I was starting to feel like I was really missing out by comparison. 

A few weeks ago while I was on Grindr, I let myself be forward and flirty/sexual for the first time ever - and surprise surprise things started heating up with one of the guys (he's 34 and lives reasonably closeby). After about a week, he was keen to meet up, and one night I finally succumbed to temptation and went back to his house. I was nervous as anything, but determined to give it a shot - and that night we ended up having sex. Immediately after, I was overcome with the realisation of what had just happened, had a shower, and pretty much left soon after. I've been feeling depressed since.

He was a nice guy about everything, and the experience of sex itself wasn't a bad one, but I am so regretful for throwing away my virginity on a one night stand with a guy that I didn't even know. I know at the time I thought I was ready and wanted to be sexually active, but in hindsight I feel like it's been a huge mistake that will stay with me forever. It's made me realise more than ever that sex is something that I need an emotional connection for - but I feel really terrible, like I can't pursue anything romantic with guys anymore. 

I know virginity is just a concept - and I don't judge others for their sex lives - but I feel like I've built myself up for years as a romantic and someone who searches for love, only to throw it away on one night of disconnected sex.

We've been dating for about 3 months and are still pretty crazy about each other, it's great. He's hot, thoughtful, nice, fun, confident, etc., and I couldn't be happier for the most part.

He's older than I am (he's 29, I'm 22) and has a lot more relationship experience- he's still friends with all 3 of his exes, including his last boyfriend who he was with for 6 years (let's call him John). John and my boyfriend are still very good friends- before my boyfriend met me, they'd still hook up from time to time as well. John even still visits my boyfriend's family on occasion. I met John a couple weeks ago, and he was perfectly friendly to me; we got on well enough and it wasn't awkward at all.

Today I was skyping with my boyfriend (I'm visiting home), and he tells me that John tried to hook up with him. He assured me that he would have never done anything, he only wants me, and that he told John firmly (again) that he's with me and won't be hooking up with him anymore. I believe him, that's not the issue. 

Then, I just said something along the lines of ""That's a shame, I'm gonna like John a bit less now."" Then my boyfriend said ""No don't blame him, it's complicated"" and started defending the guy, saying that John's is still attached to him and that John just wishes that my boyfriend would keep being ""open"" like him (they broke up because John wanted to open the relationship and my boyfriend didn't). I said I don't see how that makes trying to get my boyfriend to cheat as any less of a slap in the face to me, and he just asked me to drop it. I did just drop it, because we'd been having a nice skype up to that point and I didn't feel like interrupting it with a fight, but I've been seething a bit ever since.

It just annoys me that he just wanted to shut me down while voicing perfectly reasonable animosity toward someone that tried to get him to cheat on me. (In retrospect, it annoys me that he just asked me to drop it when I was clearly still pissed.) He expects me to keep being buddy-buddy with a guy who clearly has no consideration for me; he meets me, shakes my hand, and two weeks later is trying to fuck up my relationship. Aside from the personal offense, it just does not reflect well on his character. It's all well and good with me that my boyfriend is able to be so close with his exes, but that's contigent on his exes not acting like assholes...

I want to bring it up again because I don't feel settled on the issue, but I don't really know what to say or what it will accompish. I don't expect him to end the friendship or anything. Besides, maybe it'd be healthier in the long run to just forgive and forget since there was no harm done (and I sure know how hard it is to resist my boyfriend...). But I do figure that at the very least I would have appreciated if he heard me out instead of just asking me to drop it.

so I dunno, I guess I'm just asking how you guys would respond to the situation.

edit: thanks for the advice guys, I've cooled down and typing it all out made me realize it's definitely nothing worth starting a conflict over... at the end of the day, it's no harm no foul and holding a grudge toward a good friend of his isn't doing anyone any favors.

I know what you're thinking, ""oh, stereotypical navy guy!"" I havent actually had gay sex yet. YET. i say yet because im leaving room for future possibilities. I had my first ""fling"" with a shipmate a couple of months ago. He was my friend and what i like to do with friends is joke around a lot being the funny person that i am. I used to act gay around him. Sure enough dude thought i was actually gay. I didn't find out he was gay until he showed up at my room one day and was like ""hey wanna have sex?"" he used to say that a lot, i thought he was kidding. One thing led to another and he kissed me. However, we only ended up making out because I was still reluctant about my feelings sexually towards him. To this day we remain friends but nothing more because i told him i wasn't ready for anything yet..... Fast forward 5 months, I'm in my room and some friends drop by, my one friend, Brandon, and the other whom i never meet before. Well Brandon leaves to go hang out with some other people, leaving Smith alone with me. Brandon is gay. I've only known he was gay for about 3 months and I've know him for almost 6. He told me one day when we were working out. He was talking about his ex and was like, "" my ex used to hate being on top"" and i was like ""wouldnt you crush her if you were on top though"" he quickly corrected me, ""my ex was a guy"" I said HER and it was actually a HIM lol well that's enough of that. so back to my story, this guy a never met before, we'll call him Blackness cuz he was black, and I were in my room chilling and talking, making basic conversation and crap and he goes ""I have a question for you"" and I catch on at that moment that he was gay aswell. So, I say alright shoot, even though i already pretty much know what the question is gonna be. One thing led to another and we end up at his place. Long story short I sucked him off and he started to suck me off but i couldn't get hard and it was really embarrassing so we just started making out and shit again and then i sucked his cock some more. I had a couple hickeys the next day and my command was cracking jokes all damn day for it XD We continued seeing each other for like 3 or 4 days before i decided we were moving too fast.

Terms are weird.) and I went on a break at the beginning of the summer. He was dealing with some personal issues in the wake of a difficult spring and needed some space to focus on himself. We're both college students and have been away from our school and subsequently each other since May. We've been keeping in contact regularly since and are on good terms. 

Last night we were on the phone and he asked what it was going to be like when we see each other again. I said I'd like to try to work things out and maybe we can take things slow and rebuild our relationship. He said he didn't know. He loves me very much and I love him too, but he feels like he might not want to be in a relationship right now. We talked for a long time and I can't remember a lot of what we said, but I got the impression that he doesn't entirely know what's going on right now or what exactly it is he wants, and doesn't want to string me along waiting for an answer I might not like/might not get.

It's very confusing, I'd never really thought about the possibility of being mutually in love with someone but not being together? I'm not doubting his logic or intentions, he's a great person and I have no doubt that he's just trying to do what's best for both of us. And I certainly don't want to push him to make a decision he's not going to be happy with.

We're hanging out Saturday and neither of us really knows what to expect. I'm not going to kiss him or try anything intimate. I'm not even entirely sure what my question is, I guess I just would love any kind of wisdom you guys might have for this situation.

tl;dr- Boyfriend and I have been on a break for 4 months. He's not sure whether or not he's ready to get back together and we're hanging out again saturday. I don't know what to do?

Thanks in advance for any comments!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My boyfriend (ex-boyfriend? Terms are weird.) and I went on a break at the beginning of the summer. He was dealing with some personal issues in the wake of a difficult spring and needed some space to focus on himself. We&amp;#39;re both college students and have been away from our school and subsequently each other since May. We&amp;#39;ve been keeping in contact regularly since and are on good terms. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night we were on the phone and he asked what it was going to be like when we see each other again. I said I&amp;#39;d like to try to work things out and maybe we can take things slow and rebuild our relationship. He said he didn&amp;#39;t know. He loves me very much and I love him too, but he feels like he might not want to be in a relationship right now.

I'm a 40yo gay dude. Met my dream man a few months ago and we have been hitting it off well. The cool thing is that he is truly a giant, meaning a very big, tall, strong, awesome person. And proportional. Way bigger &amp; thicker than anything I have previously known. I love his unique body and it's a lot of fun. He is also a 100% top and I am like 80% not a bottom. But with everything else being great, I want to be able to please him.

I have been working with a gradual kit of ""openers"", mostly in the shower, but if I'm working with size 1-3, he would be like a 7. We have also tried various positions but it's still not progressing as fast as we hoped. Lots of lube as well. The most successful we have been together was when he was lying on the bed, I was facing him, and he slid me down over the top. I probably got around 3/4 of the way, but with the movement it just got to be too much.

BJs are also a problem unfortunately as he makes me gag when it touches the back of my throat (he gives great head though). So right now, if we are to complete, it's mostly handies, but even then there is an imbalance because I cum a lot faster than he does. Sometimes he has to finish himself. I have heard that larger guys can tend to take longer than us regulars.

I'm afraid that he's starting to think I'm a selfish lover, and that maybe he's not as into me since we don't get off together. I don't know. Any advice?

Me and my boyfriend have been dating a while now and have had a pretty fun sex life so far mostly bj's hj's and he loves it when I eat his ass but our attempts to have penetrative sex so far have been well....  failures.  We have a problem, or rather two problems.  Firstly I wasn't exactly born with the biggest equipment (5in) - there's a running joke in my social circle that I was born with all the brains and my brother got all the junk (he's about as sharp as a brick).  And my boyfriend has a bodacious bubble butt with a really deep crack.  We have tried several different positions and unfortunately nothing has worked.  Any smaller guys out there have any secret positions they'd like to divulge?

I want to make my boyfriends first time memorable - and my first time to be memorable too.  We are each other's firsts as embarrassing as that is.  ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So first time poster in here,&lt;/p&gt;

Are our lives too different for it to work out? I really like him and he likes me too. The sex is amazing and we have such a good time on dates. Will the age (and life milestones) become an issue or am I overreacting?
