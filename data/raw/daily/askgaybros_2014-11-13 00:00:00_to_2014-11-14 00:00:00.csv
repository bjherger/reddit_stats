http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/26b7b9/ive_been_seeing_someone_for_a_month_not_sure_if_i/

After I made the above post, I continued seeing this guy for about a couple of months until mid-July (we started seeing each other in late April). All of the red flags people mentioned had came up and it ended pretty horribly. It was extremely toxic by the end and I was very glad to be free of him. Unfortunately, given that we both attend the same University and have some of the same classes, we've had no shortage of awkward run-ins. I suspect that this lack of distance meant that neither of us were able to break free and properly move on. 

Following the breakup, he relentlessly pursued to get me back for the following two months. I rejected his advances every time and I had no intention of reconciling. Yet, in the last month or so, I've noticed the changes he has made to himself and the reasons I previously had for breaking up are starting to fade away. It's almost like I'm talking to a new person. He's still coming after me and I have less and less reason to turn him down. My head says it's a bad idea but he's made such drastic improvements to himself that I'm failing to justify my decisions. We've even started talking again (often until the early hours of the morning) and I can feel something to start up but something still feels not quite right. 

I don't want to get back together with him, but I feel like my defenses are crumbling. I want to move on but he keeps pulling me back. What do I do? 

TL;DR. Head says no, heart is sending mixed signals.

I am in no way self-hating, and I would always prefer that the candidates in office be pro-ENDA and pro-SSM, but I don't think that this is the ultimate measure of a candidate's electability.

For example, I'm against the Affordable Care Act. It puts a higher demand on nurses and physicians, and creates a greater need for them in this country. Traditionally, when more physicians and nurses are needed, the accrediting boards will lower their standards, allowing more individuals to be certified. This will put more people in the medical profession that are less qualified, and will therefore decrease the standards of care. By decreasing the standards of care, many people will be affected, and, in the aggregate, in can be expected that many people die or suffer serious harm who could have otherwise been effectively treated if the higher standards of care were still in place.

Another example is the economy. While I again have no intention of debating the merits of one economic policy over another (for this is not the proper vehicle for that), if one were to believe that the economy would be much improved under one leader rather than another, one could actually justify voting for a candidate who is against gay rights. Children who are raised in poverty have it much worse, on average, than children who are gay. If you look at the violent crime rates, the high school graduation rates, and the ability to pull one's self up, you quickly realize just how disadvantaged low-income people are. By supporting the candidates you believe are best for the economy and for poor people, you are voting to help out the most amount of people. (Allow me now to reiterate that I am not interested in debating politics or the recent minimum wage legislation.)

A final point I'd like to make is that, in this country, the legislature is doing next-to-nothing to promote gay rights. Obama, while he talks the talk, has done very little for gay marriage, while congress has done little for or against gay marriage. This is all being decided in the courts. (Yes, there is an argument to be made for the president appointing justices and the senate confirming.)

All I'm saying is that, maybe we, as the queer community, shouldn't ostracize people who don't put themselves first. It's noble if, when you weigh all the options, you decide to promote someone else who, while they may not be the best for you, will be the best for everyone. That's called selflessness and self-sacrifice, and that should be respected. We shouldn't be calling people self-haters just because their political views differ from ours.

Midnight crisis here. TL;DR at the bottom.

At the beginning of the year, I had a match on Tinder. I'm quite active on the apps, talk to many people, but rarely I feel a connection.

Well, it was an instant hit on both side. We shared similar humor, he was nice, interesting, I felt like I could trust him. After some chat I implied we could see each other, he was nervous. Then he played dumb, like ""I didn't realize it was a relationship app, I'm already with someone, we've been together for 3 years"". So my instant reaction was to be mad, I told him I couldn't pursue and stopped talking.

But he came back to me two weeks later. He felt bad and was finding me interesting on many levels, and I thought the same. I told myself he could be a valuable friend. And the more we were getting to know each other, the more I was ""winning points"" so to speak to him. Nevertheless, I always kept it to an appropriate level, by respect. We saw each other a couple of time, for a lunch, a beer, for a long deep talk. He was very caring and we shared many secrets about our past, things I never really told anyone. It was nice, and playful at the same time since, well, it all began with a mutual interest.

But then I started to feel like I was very attracted, and my first reaction was to told him so we can discuss it. My request was that we could stay in touch online on Facebook, but we had to stop seeing each other so I could move on.

Eventually I made him realize that there was some flirt sometime. He got defensive, claiming he was aiming for a healthy relationship and what I said was going against that. Didn't push further.

Flash forward a couple of month, summer 2014. Bad time in my life: I was having trouble in every department. Was never called back for any summer job application, any boys I met ended being a disappointment, my friends were away, my family too. So I had no job, my friends were mostly away or working. I felt miserable and alone. So one morning I woke up with a morning wood. Like always, we joked around (we're open), and it turned into sexting on both sides (with pictures and all).

I felt guilty right after, almost had a panic attack, I worked hard to make them disappear from our conversation (not because of a lack of will, but more like a technical limitation on our device). We talked about it. He's usually pretty open, but I could feel my panic made him feel uncomfortable and a little bit disappointed, like, instead of ""it was fun, let's keep that good memory"", I transformed this into something horrible. Was my first time doing sexting with photos so I kind of panicked.

And it went back to radio silent for weeks, me doing my stuff and him living his life. Then just tonight, it happened again. I was at school, we started to talk about porn, he was horny, I got home, one things lead to another. And there I am, questioning myself.

In short, we have a very very good chemistry. We are attracted to each other, but I don't want to be with him or him to break up with his BF. He's 30 years old (I'm 23), he's established in his life, I don't want to be ""the bomb"", I don't feel ready to be in relationship with him anyway, I feel like I wouldn't bring as much as his actual BF, who is in a contemporary dance group with him (that's where they met)... And many other reasons, including his... unfaithful behavior at the moment.



Yet I don't know how to define all that. One moment we're both playful, then the next one we're not talking for a while. Not voluntarily, it just happens. In the meanwhile I feel guilty (and dirty), I feel bad, and I don't know how to handle that. I was about to send him a message just now on how I felt, but I remembered we already had a similar discussion in the past and apparently it didn't change a thing if it happened again. I don't mind having another conversation, but I feel like it's a repetitive pattern... And it wouldn't happen if I could tell or define the friendship.
Part of me is convinced (he implied it a couple of time) that he's not much happy anymore in his life (he used to be very *very* sexually active before coming in Canada and meeting his BF), but he avoids the subject everytime, or he's vague about it... And since he's not happy anymore, I'm like the fun refreshing part... Yet he's caring (he's a doctor for kids), so it's just like one big contradiction in my head and I'm lost. He's not necessarily using me since he pleases me, but at the same time I feel like he's getting more what he wants than I do about all this... Yet he's a good friend too. It's a knot of contradictions.

**TL;DR**: Guy in relationship has been alternating between flirting/friendzoning me for months. He's a nice caring guy, he doesn't seem to do it on purpose. I feel like he's unhappy in his couple, but I don't want to be in relationship with him. We're both attracted to each other, it reached sexting (with photos) twice. I feel guilty and bad and I don't know what else to do since I already requested to stop seeing each other in person last Spring and we don't talk much online anymore. Should I speak to him about this once again or should I go to the higher level and just... cut everything?

Thanks!
","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello there. Midnight crisis here. TL;DR at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the year, I had a match on Tinder. I&amp;#39;m quite active on the apps, talk to many people, but rarely I feel a connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, it was an instant hit on both side. We shared similar humor, he was nice, interesting, I felt like I could trust him. After some chat I implied we could see each other, he was nervous. Then he played dumb, like &amp;quot;I didn&amp;#39;t realize it was a relationship app, I&amp;#39;m already with someone, we&amp;#39;ve been together for 3 years&amp;quot;. So my instant reaction was to be mad, I told him I couldn&amp;#39;t pursue and stopped talking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But he came back to me two weeks later. He felt bad and was finding me interesting on many levels, and I thought the same. I told myself he could be a valuable friend. And the more we were getting to know each other, the more I was &amp;quot;winning points&amp;quot; so to speak to him. Nevertheless, I always kept it to an appropriate level, by respect. We saw each other a couple of time, for a lunch, a beer, for a long deep talk. He was very caring and we shared many secrets about our past, things I never really told anyone. It was nice, and playful at the same time since, well, it all began with a mutual interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then I started to feel like I was very attracted, and my first reaction was to told him so we can discuss it. My request was that we could stay in touch online on Facebook, but we had to stop seeing each other so I could move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually I made him realize that there was some flirt sometime. He got defensive, claiming he was aiming for a healthy relationship and what I said was going against that. Didn&amp;#39;t push further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flash forward a couple of month, summer 2014. Bad time in my life: I was having trouble in every department. Was never called back for any summer job application, any boys I met ended being a disappointment, my friends were away, my family too. So I had no job, my friends were mostly away or working. I felt miserable and alone. So one morning I woke up with a morning wood. Like always, we joked around (we&amp;#39;re open), and it turned into sexting on both sides (with pictures and all).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt guilty right after, almost had a panic attack, I worked hard to make them disappear from our conversation (not because of a lack of will, but more like a technical limitation on our device). We talked about it. He&amp;#39;s usually pretty open, but I could feel my panic made him feel uncomfortable and a little bit disappointed, like, instead of &amp;quot;it was fun, let&amp;#39;s keep that good memory&amp;quot;, I transformed this into something horrible. Was my first time doing sexting with photos so I kind of panicked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it went back to radio silent for weeks, me doing my stuff and him living his life. Then just tonight, it happened again. I was at school, we started to talk about porn, he was horny, I got home, one things lead to another. And there I am, questioning myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, we have a very very good chemistry. We are attracted to each other, but I don&amp;#39;t want to be with him or him to break up with his BF. He&amp;#39;s 30 years old (I&amp;#39;m 23), he&amp;#39;s established in his life, I don&amp;#39;t want to be &amp;quot;the bomb&amp;quot;, I don&amp;#39;t feel ready to be in relationship with him anyway, I feel like I wouldn&amp;#39;t bring as much as his actual BF, who is in a contemporary dance group with him (that&amp;#39;s where they met)... And many other reasons, including his... unfaithful behavior at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet I don&amp;#39;t know how to define all that. One moment we&amp;#39;re both playful, then the next one we&amp;#39;re not talking for a while. Not voluntarily, it just happens. In the meanwhile I feel guilty (and dirty), I feel bad, and I don&amp;#39;t know how to handle that. I was about to send him a message just now on how I felt, but I remembered we already had a similar discussion in the past and apparently it didn&amp;#39;t change a thing if it happened again. I don&amp;#39;t mind having another conversation, but I feel like it&amp;#39;s a repetitive pattern... And it wouldn&amp;#39;t happen if I could tell or define the friendship.
Part of me is convinced (he implied it a couple of time) that he&amp;#39;s not much happy anymore in his life (he used to be very &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; sexually active before coming in Canada and meeting his BF), but he avoids the subject everytime, or he&amp;#39;s vague about it... And since he&amp;#39;s not happy anymore, I&amp;#39;m like the fun refreshing part... Yet he&amp;#39;s caring (he&amp;#39;s a doctor for kids), so it&amp;#39;s just like one big contradiction in my head and I&amp;#39;m lost. He&amp;#39;s not necessarily using me since he pleases me, but at the same time I feel like he&amp;#39;s getting more what he wants than I do about all this... Yet he&amp;#39;s a good friend too. It&amp;#39;s a knot of contradictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt;: Guy in relationship has been alternating between flirting/friendzoning me for months. He&amp;#39;s a nice caring guy, he doesn&amp;#39;t seem to do it on purpose. I feel like he&amp;#39;s unhappy in his couple, but I don&amp;#39;t want to be in relationship with him. We&amp;#39;re both attracted to each other, it reached sexting (with photos) twice.

Should I speak to him about this once again or should I go to the higher level and just... cut everything?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

I'll start by saying I haven't really ""dated"" before, other than one guy but that was not great.  So I went on a date yesterday set up by my friend and mutual friend and it went really really well.  The guy was awesome and we have so much in common.  We just met for coffee and ended up chatting there for 3 hours, but then he was having dinner with his friends so had to leave.  I couldn't stop smiling once I left and was so excited.  I heard from my friend that he thought it went great too and he sent me a text today saying he really enjoyed himself.

I guess my question is, how do I not mess this up?  I'm keen to meet up again and I think he would be too, but I don't want to seem too keen and put him off.  Do we meet for coffee again or do I suggest dinner or is that too much?  Or anything else?  I really don't know how to approach these sorts of situations.

I kind of think I'm punching a bit above my weight in the looks department (he is really cute, the waitresses were flirting with him like nothing I have ever seen before) and feel a bit insecure about that.  His situation is a little complicated but doesn't actually put me off at all (he has a kid and lives with her mother and their family - they aren't together and it seems to work apparently).

This past weekend was a nightmare. By the end of it, it seemed like everyone thought it would be totally funny to humiliate me. Mocking my voice, jokingly flirting, breaking into Spice Girls songs when I entered the room, calling me ""sister,"" etc. It's weird, because none of the other gay people who work there seem to get that sort of treatment.

My parents also think I'm gay now, and people in my college classes also seem to think so as well.

The only possible reason I can think of for this is that I've started to take antidepressants, and that maybe I seem more gay when I'm less depressed. But I really don't feel like I've changed at all.

About my parents thinking that I'm gay: that is a serious problem for me. They're starting to act a bit more *distant*, it seems. I'm starting to get really worried.

I feel the time is right, and I want to tell her, but I'm concerned not that she will take it badly with me being bisexual, but more her reaction will be recorded for national audiences and she'll be duped into taking part with the whole thing (TV producers have told her it's just about Uni). I feel that it's a personal thing and as much as I'd like to see her reaction as a positive message to tv audiences, I'm not sure if the fact that she'll take it well that this is what the Documentary and we're filming her just getting her reaction.

UPDATE: So yeah, I kinda answered my own question anyway... however I'm so glad I heard it from other people before.

It's ultimately about Consent, and I won't allow TV producers to potentially fuck up my trust between my Mum and Me because I kept a secret just for a bit of good TV. 

Plus I'll have to tell my Dad off camera as he doesn't want to be filmed and my mum would have already had a reaction, and that makes it even more complicated and the ability that everything will fuck up... so yeah I think I'll tell her and then Tell the host (Tyger Drew Honey) How it went afterwards.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long story short, I&amp;#39;m taking part in a BBC documentary about Sexuality, I&amp;#39;m super pumped for it and should be a blast, aside from going round Brighton and deconstructing bisexuality and masculinity, one of the parts the producers want me to do is to film me coming out to my mum.&lt;/p&gt;
