I'm not attracted to guys at all like I am with girls, but something about someone being submissive to me really gets me off, guy or girl. With porn the submission is my main thing with both straight and gay porn.

Anyway. Ive been looking around and found a gay sauna in my area (Sydney, AU) and thinking I might go along as see if I am really into guys, or whats going on with me.

Now Im worried about a few things, hopefully someone can help?

Is a gay sauna a good place to have my ""first time""?

I'm actually pretty pro-laws with 3 caveats.

* Burden of proof of non-disclosure is on accuser (duh)

* Things like condom usage and being undetectable are huge mitigating factors (if combined, no serious punishment should be on the table... perhaps even decriminalized)

* Lying is considered worse than if you weren't asked

If those three considerations are met, I think a criminalization law is valid (and I'd be perfectly fine with similar laws regarding diseases passed via intimate contact that are as serious... like when Typhoid Mary decide to go back to cooking).

 I strongly feel that saying the other person is at fault is victim blaming. Unprotected sex is a risk...yes. But there is a knowledge gap between the two parties whose implications go largely in one direction. Also, if a law was constructed correctly (I know many aren't), what kind of selfish, hedonistic prick are you if you put sex above your own, and your partner's health and use it as a reason not to get tested. I think/hope the gay community is better than that.

To keep it short:  Me and a female friend have been making Halloween plans lately.  We're both university students and have decided to go out clubbing with a group of my friends she doesn't know.  No problem, she's a babe and they'll love her.  The problem is a mutual ""friend"" and fellow gay. We'll call him Mark.  Inverted commas used since he's mostly her friend and I don't particularly like him but tolerate him for her sake.  I know for a fact he's dressing up as Wonderwoman for Halloween, he showed us the costume and everything.  

Anyway, plans with his friends fell through and he asked to come out with us instead.  She left it up to me and I bullshitted some excuse about how I wasn't organising the night and not being in the position to invite someone along.  This is half true, we are meeting up at one of my friends houses for pre-drinks and I wouldn't want to bring someone unannounced.  

However, he pushed it.  And pushed it.  And pushed it.  I snapped.  I told him he wasn't coming because I'd be embarrassed that my other friends and people at the club would associate me with him.  Needless to say, he wasn't impressed.  He called me homophobic (?) and says I don't understand what it's like since people mostly assume I'm straight and if he was one of my ""straight, manly"" friends (his words) I wouldn't think twice about the costume.  

My reply was ""fuck off Mark"" but it has got me thinking...

It's not just that I'd be embarrassed.  We don't exactly live in the nicest part of England and I'm sure a lot of people around here would have no problem with gay-bashing.  I'm not the biggest guy in the world but he couldn't hold his own in a fight at all.  Like I said, I don't particularly like the guy and wouldn't want to attract trouble over him.  I don't want any of my other friends to get in any trouble because of him either.  

I don't understand why me being straight-passing is an issue when he's going out in a skirt either?

I guess I'm wondering if I'm being unreasonable or homophobic here?  Opinions appreciated as I have class with him on Thursday and I'm not looking forward to it...

(Obligatory sorry if this breaks any rules/the topic has been posted to death, I'm new to the subreddit).

EDIT: Huh, not so short after all.  Sorry for the wall of text!

EDIT 2: Sorry for more text, but it's been pointed out this next information is relevant.  My major reason for disliking Mark isn't his effemininity.

It's been just over a year since I came to terms with being bisexual, and I've found myself in a bit of a slump lately.

I think what it comes down to is that I don't yet completely understand this part of myself. I'm not out to most people I know or any of my family, and honestly I'm terrified of the prospect of coming out, simply because I don't want to have to ""start over"" in the life I'm already living. I feel like I'm just following a routine at this point and not being honest with myself or others. As a result I find myself feeling stuck where I am and longing for a new start. But having 2 years left of undergrad is getting in the way of that.

So I guess my question would be: Got any ideas as to how I may help myself get out of this slump? 

I realize this probably sounds incredibly cryptic. Should any additional info from me help out, just ask.

Thanks guys! Y'all are the best.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey bros!&lt;/p&gt;

We met in a club’s swimming pool team we both attended to. And that time, he had already dated some women while I couldn’t even think about having either a boyfriend or a girlfriend (and I wasn’t even sure what I wanted). The point is, we developed a really good relationship and, in due time, he told me he wanted to have a relationship with me. After a few days I accepted to myself that I wanted it too, so we started dating. At that point, he would have totally come out to his parents, especially when my parents founded some of our conversations and asked me whether or not I was having a relationship with this guy. I don’t know why we didn’t say a thing... maybe I was scared of their reaction although they had already told me it was alright, but I was almost 17 years old and I wasn’t sure of their reactions. No doubts that our parents know that we were dating, though. 
Anyway, a year and a half ago he told me he wasn’t sure which his sexual preferences were, but we stayed being boyfriends. Looking at it now, it would have been better ending it then, everything that followed was getting worse. 
Some time ago, in April, he told me that he was scared about being gay, that he wanted to have an easier life with not so many complications, and that he wanted to have a wife and children, because he wouldn’t be able to cope with the pressure of people judgement, although he wanted me to stay in his like because he really appreciate and care about me. He was literally stabbing my heart while driving... So, I accepted that to him, because he was really scared and crying. I went home and spoke to my best female-friend at that time, who also told me that she was having a breakup with a guy... MY GUY, which whom she had been dating for almost a year already, but told her he didn’t have time for her anymore. I almost collapsed. The next day I waited for him at work and confront her about this former friend. He told me he was lying and that he would never cheat on anyone, and that he had never lied to me, which is true. We ended up making up and being a sort of friends-with-benefits. I mean sort of because for the last month we have met once (last Thursday).
 However, on weekend some friends, this girl included, went to his house to spend the night. We were watching horror films and the both of them were like lying together, and when he started mocking me I became furious and jealous, and started punching him with a pillow... and he almost threw me out of his home. 
The next morning, when everyone left, I told him I wanted to speak with him and told him I was sorry my reaction the previous night, but that I wanted to know why everyone was saying that the both of them were dating. He yelled at me and told that he I was out of my mind and that he didn’t have to give me any explanations, and that I’ve been making him things he disliked for over a year and that he couldn’t believed that I was getting sad about the situation. In the end he told me to leave, and I told him that if I had to leave like this he would never see me again. ‘I think it’s perfect he told me’. Later that Sunday he messaged me telling that he was sorry about the way he had treated me but that he needed that, and thanked me for understanding. 
I don’t really know what to do. I saw him just a minute yesterday at the club and he clearly wasn’t happy. I pretty sure he still loves me and that he likes the time we spend together. I mean, you can tell when a guy is horny or not enjoying it, and we’ve been together for four year, I can make him horny in just two seconds... but he is scared. Also, a friend told me we was hypocrite because he wanted to lie about his sexuality and that he was manipulating me because he needed someone to rely on in case his ego went down. But the thing is I really love him and it hurts me just to look at him. What should I do? Really disappear from his life? Continue meeting with him in the club and in the swimming pool, or should I stopped going? I can’t really stand that girl, is like I wanna punch her in the face, and the worst part is that she doesn’t know why... What do you think?

Ok sorry about the paragraphs thing... i wrote it on a Word and then I copy pasted it and didn't check it befor posting it.

I know it's a little but confusing.... it didn't want to make it too long so i took a lot away. 

To make things clear... perhaps he didn't cheat on my... that girl might have been lying to me. I guess I'll never know. 

And it's not like he wasn't gay at all... he told me that it was the fear of society and how scary it could be to come out.

This morning I had a small surgery at my anus and I'll have a small scar right next to the hole. The questions now are: will I face any difficulties when having sex (still a virgin)? Is there something I need to watch out for? Would such a small scar be a dealbreaker for some of you?

I know I should ask my doctor (I'll see him tomorrow again for changing the bandage) but maybe some people in here have experience. Wanna be a bit prepared for tomorrow.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, I&amp;#39;m asking for experience here.
