I did a post couple weeks ago about having my heart broken by a guy (I deleted the post, sorry).  Keeping a long story short: One day he  told me things like ""We belong together,"" ""This feels right,"" ""I haven't felt this way for anyone before,"" and the next day, literally, he makes out with a friend's ex, which he is now dating, and ends it all. Leaving me and the friend a bit flabbergasted as to what happened.

This is the first time I ever had to deal with a broken heart. I'm really progressing with the healing, but I just wanted to seek some advice from other bros out there.  

I did some reflecting on the situation of him and I. It wasn't the best situation with him and I.  He had a lot of growing up to do.  However, on the other hand I miss the big lug and I want him back as friend.  

So bros, is this a normal part of the healing process, or am I just messed up? ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Gaybros!&lt;/p&gt;

Besides, though being 27, I may still have unresolved teenage issues still going on at various levels, thus preventing me from getting into a relationship at all. I am thus consulting you for advice, and perhaps help on how to find a way out of this situation.

Let's first say that, from a time perspective, I have had issues on the relationship front for several years, well for about 5 years I would say, when my last relationship ended (we were together for a few months). Before then, I would hardly meet any guys. I was still transitioning from awkward teenage years into adulthood. 

After this first relationship ended, I fell in love with several guys in a row over the space of a few months. Sadly this was not reciprocated, and this really affected me deeply.

Fast forward a few years, I have now grown more confident, and get a lot of attention from other guys. But deep down I still feel I have not grown out of that awkward teenager phase, and feel wholly unprepared to accommodate someone else in my life. This has led me to pursuing mainly casual relationships - and I have no trouble finding that. Pursuing the latter is also a kind of barrier - as I've been let down emotionally in the past, revoke any hope for a relationship enabled me to grow in character and confidence. I know that if I let myself go, I will inevitably be very intense, as in seek cuddles, etc. I will also be very involved, and equally heartbroken should anything bad happen. Casual sex is merely a way to circumvent that and protect me on that front.

However, I am getting tired of the whole grindr/hook-up thing. I am aware that I am using as a substitute for the love I cannot find on the other hand - fleeting bouts of affection which vanish as soon as our dicks start becoming flaccid again. This a vicious cycle, built on rocky emotional foundations. And I am aware that there may be other guys in the same situation as me.

The only time I've ever been the dumper the guy was emotionally abusive.

I've put a lot of thought into it and I think this boils down to two reasons: 

1) I tend to get ahead of myself. I realized I had this problem when I noticed that I would spend a *lot* of time thinking about the guy I just went on a date with, and then we'd talk a lot, and then one day he'd drop off the face of the earth. This has happened several times in the past year.

2) I'm settling. In retrospect, there hasn't been a single relationship I've entered without realizing there were some red flags I normally would have noticed had we not been dating. I think that I may have a self-esteem problem if that's the case. I'm not saying I need to date Mr. Perfect or anything, but all my past relationships ended because of real problems the other guy had including clearly not being over his ex, emotionally disturbed by years of parental abuse that I definitely could not fix, etc.

I'm definitely getting better at saying no, but I'm not quite there yet. It doesn't really help that the gay scene at my university is pretty tight-knit, so anything that happens to you, the rest of the gays know by the end of the week.

Any advice on how to keep your cool during the initial dating period, and how to tell the difference between a quirk most people can overlook and a major red flag that can't be avoided? Also, self-esteem issues I guess.

Oh, and I'm 20 years old if that helps the situation any.

Tl;dr I'm not good at reading first impressions and other college bullshit.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, long story short, I&amp;#39;ve almost never been the dumper in a relationship nor have I been the one to go &amp;quot;I just can&amp;#39;t see us becoming long-term&amp;quot; when casually dating someone.

One thing that bugs me endlessly is that even we LGBT people don't know how many of us there are. The 3.5% or 5% figure, in my opinion, is hugely underestimated; at the same time I'm not so sure about the 20%.

I usually play this number game: pick a group of people (say, a college class, a circle of friends) and determine how many of them I know to be gay, then allow for some closeted/late-blooming cases. The percentage usually works out to between 10%-20%. 

Have you ever tried to estimate the gay population? What have you found? 

EDIT: by 'gay' I mean homosexual/bisexual/pansexual/etc. Anything that is more than a one-off attraction to members of the same sex.

**Some clarifications:**

* I go with same-sex attraction rather than identification. People can have same-sex attraction without identifying as gay, because they are bi, or questioning, or closeted. So that definitely makes my estimate greater than meets the eye.

* I go to a liberal college, so that obviously attracts more gay people. I consider it the only bias because going to college is mostly a matter of choice. I don't think people in the south experience less same-sex attraction than people in the north, whether they admit it or not.
