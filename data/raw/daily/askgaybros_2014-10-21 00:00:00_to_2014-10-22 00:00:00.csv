Maybe I deserve it... I can be a pretty heartless bitch. If someone were to come to me crying that they don't think they'll find love, I'd internally roll my eyes. I don't feel like I can talk to anyone. I don't want to be that sad person no one likes. I like to look like I have everything under control, but I don't. 

Sometimes I miss being a little boy. Being able to just break down and cry in someone's arms. ""Oh, but you've gotta be a man!"" sure... I am. Outside everything looks great. But sometimes, I just wanna break down and cry and have someone tell me it'll be ok. 

uhg, but thats not what this is about. Ive been dating a guy. I think I may love him... but I don't think he loves me back. I want to give him my all, but I don't think he wants it. I feel so worthless. He's obviously attracted to me physically. But I don't know why he won't love me. 

Before you start judging, I know I sound incredibly needy and clingy and pathetic. But trust me, that I keep my cool around him. I think it was Oscar Wilde who said ""a man is no more himself than when he wears a mask."" the anonymity of reddit affords me the luxury to be a complete mess. 

I'm not a great looking guy. I mean, I'm alright I guess. I have a nice face. I'm a bit fat, but some guys like that. This guy likes that I'm chubby. So many guys can fuck me, but no one ever wants to love me. And I just don't understand. God why won't anyone love me? I feel so broken. I'm broken and I don't even know how it is I'm broken or how to fix myself. 

I don't know... maybe it'd be different if I knew love once. Like, maybe I could just date and fuck around a bit and have failed relationships if I could tell myself ""well, someone loved you once..."" but no one has. No one has ever loved me. No one has ever seen any worth in me. Oh gosh... I so want to be loved. I want to feel safe in someone's arms. And I want it while I'm still young. I don't mind so much if I lose it, so much as I know that while it lasted, it was real. 

I feel like just curling up into my bed and crying. I think I'll do that, maybe I'll feel better in the morning. Maybe I'll have the courage to tell this guy I'm seeing that I don't want to see him anymore, because I think he's just having me around until something better comes along. Or is just keeping me around recreationally. Maybe I'd rather be alone than someone's stand-by.

So our story begins late September 2012, not long after my senior year of high school had  begun. I was 17. I was in a special Culinary Arts career pathway class in high school. Part of this class included going out and catering local events. One night I went out on a catering to a winery, and there I met a boy. We'll call him Brandon. He was in the same class, but in the period just before mine. He was a sophomore, 2 days from his 16th birthday. We just started talking out of the blue, and the conversation flowed like it never had with anyone I'd known before. (I'm not much of a talker). I thought about him all the way home. My heart fluttered. A couple days later we both signed up for another event. From the very start we were talking and carrying on like we'd known each other for years. After that event, the two of us hung out together. We smoked some weed (his first time, I had done so for several years) and drove around town all night, running through sprinklers, wandering through the woods behind my house, and listening to lots of music. When I finally dropped him off and got home the sun was rising, on a school day, but I didn't care. It was the most magical night of my life at that point. For the next several months until the end of school, we hung out frequently, so much that my other friends began getting suspicious and soon realized how infatuated I had become with Brandon. We both would hang out together in the kitchen of the culinary classroom during break and lunch every day, often just the two of us. I'd ditch classes I found boring to join him in the culinary class (the culinary teacher had an extremely lassez-faire attitude towards student conduct) On school nights we'd sneak out after our parents had gone to sleep to meet up, drive up to the top of the hill overlooking our city, and spend hours talking about life and our dreams and music and what the future held and all those sorts of spacey things people want to talk about until 3 in the morning. We could just talk and talk and never run out of interesting things to say. It was like we both saw the world through the same lens. He told me he only ever smoked pot with me because it was our special thing and he didn't' want to feel it with anyone else. He told me I was the most important person in the world to him. I told him I felt the same. I really did.
 This pattern continued through the summer, at a pretty steady rate. We knew I'd be moving two states away (California to Colorado) and resolved to enjoy the time we had while it lasted. We had a lot of fun that summer.
 After I moved to Denver for school (JWU) things started to get strained. He had never been super great at phone communication/texting (which hadn't been a problem, most of our texting until that point had been simply arranging meet-ups) but it now seemed harder than ever to contact him. Sometimes I'd get a message back from him six days later, sometimes he wouldn't reply at all. It was frustrating. When I came back for winter break he was overjoyed, as was I, and we spent every single night with each other until I had to go back. On the final night, when I dropped him off around 4 in the morning, he hugged me and wouldn't let go for a long time. I thought about kissing him then but I didn't. i truly do not know how things would have panned out had I done that. Anyway, I went back to school and the communication issues persisted. It felt like he had forgotten about me after I left. I felt very lonely, having few new friends at college and not many people to talk to. I did end up getting into a gay bar wing-manning my fresh-on-the-rebound lesbian friend, which was an interesting experience to say the least, but I still spent the rest of the year missing him deeply. 
 During this time, Brandon began spending a lot of time with a friend of his that I never particularly liked who we'll call Asshat. He and Asshat had been friends about as long as I knew Brandon, but they had never gotten so close. They were spending multiple nights over at each other's houses and going to high school parties and all that jazz. I was jealous. 
So I come home to California for the summer. My stay here is six months instead of three because the first semester of my sophomore year was designated as my internship term, and I decided to seek an internship in California. Back to the story.
 When I came back for the summer we still hung out the way we used to, but nowhere nearly as frequently. He was spending a lot more time with Asshat because Asshat was moving to the east coast soon (good riddance, fucker) and suddenly, even though I was home I felt like I did back in Denver. I remember one night as I was driving him home, It felt like the exact perfect moment to tell him how I felt. I was about to spill the tea when Asshat called Brandon, extremely drunk on champagne, to tell him he didn't know what part of town he had wandered into, and asked him to find him a ride. He remained on the phone with him for the remainder of the ride while I internally questioned if he cared as much about me as I did for him.
 After Asshat moved away, we began to hang out more frequently. He told me during our long talks that he had become closer to Asshat while I was away because he was so lonely. I made a point of reminding him how lonely I was in Denver. He acknowledged that he had spent way too much energy on Asshat. We were back to where we were, hanging out all the time, all night long, talking for hours. He was still hard to get ahold of but would actually make an effort to contact me first, something he hadn't done all summer. 
 Fast forward to about a week and a half ago. We drove up to our spot overlooking the city and sat in my Jeep, smoking a joint and looking down at the city lights. It was all so perfect, and when the song I had decided would be my 'coming out' song way back in 2008 (Believe Me Natalie by The Killers, in case you were wondering) came on my iPod, I just straight up told him I was gay. He smiled, said ""I knew that"" and gave me a hug. It was the best reaction I've had from anyone. I cried just a little out of joy, as he was the last of my friends I had to tell. He hugged me again after dropping me off at my house, just the same way he had when I had to leave for school again at the end of winter break. 
  Several days later, after once again being unable to get in contact with him, he calls me at midnight asking to hang out. I of course say yes and we go sneak into a park near my house and sit on a bench staring at the lake. Out of the blue he tells me he's lost his virginity. I'm completely floored by this and ask him the details. He (just turned 18) went to some 27-year old coworker's house and got drunk and had sex with her. They apparently were at it for about an hour and a half before they stopped. He didn't come. I just felt so overcome with disappointment and disgust I couldn't even speak. He hadn't shown any interest in girls for the two years I had known him and now suddenly he was fucking some 27-year old bitch. It was like I had suddenly woken up in a nightmare. He could tell I was extremely upset, and asked why, which I brushed off as me simply being sad that everyone I knew but me had someone (which was true). When we walked back to my house we were silent for a large portion of the trip. As we approached his car we talked about my depression (kinda glossed over that but basically I had been telling him about being depressed for months and attempting suicide in Denver) and I said that nobody made me happy. After a few moments of silence he asked me ""Do I make you happy?"" and I replied ""You make me happy, but not in all the ways I need to be happy."" He was silent after that. We hugged once more outside his car, then I watched him drive away. I haven't said a word to him in six days, I don't even know if I should. Am I right to be upset that he had sex with someone else, despite there being no solidly defined romantic relationship between us? What should I do? Am I a dumbass for going through al this? Any and all feedback and advice is welcomed, as are PMs. Just give me some things to think about, everything is so murky and unsure to me.

Examples:

* He is overweight compared to what I normally like but is working his ass off 5 times a week and lost 30 pounds so far, I don't know his end goals but he is the kind of guy that you just see he is a few pounds and a haircut away from being fucking handsome. 
* He seems really social (party) and always wants to do something; which is great except that I'm exceptionally overwhelmed with work until Christmas. I always feel like I'm turning him down and dealing with him insisting over text messages has become annoying because he doesn't seem to understand my situation.
* He lives pretty far away but I'll most likely buy a car in February and if things get serious I have a house where he could just move in basically whenever.

There are others but the common point of these examples are the same : nothing is deal-breaking and he could be an amazing guy; but there are so many stuff that doesn't ""fit"" right now, either from our personalities or our situations.

So my options are:

* Look for someone who is more in-line with what I desire.
* Build a relationship on the promise that they are petty issues or will be fixed eventually.
* Tell him that the timing seem bad, that I think it'd be better off if we keep in touch but that I'm not considering anything serious until I'm through with this period of my life.

Pretty much a lurker/commenter to this sub and reddit in general. Looking for some advice from the community and also a slight rant. 

I (M23) graduated college and considered myself lucky that I was able to live and work in the place that I called home for 4 years. For a year I was at a pretty decent job related to my degree, wasn't making much, but I didn't hate doing it. Took a chance and got another job that paid a little more with a company that is now crushing my spirit and in turn I hope will fail in the near future due to mismanagement. SOOOO I'm in the market for a new job. 

I live in South Carolina but am not set on staying here permanently. I have a significant amount of student debt which has made it so that I have been unable to save any money from my jobs. I will be visiting Seattle for about a week for family that is there. Just for shits-n-giggles looked at job openings, which much like any city, there are quite a few. Its quite enticing. 

I guess my question is, does anyone have advice/experience about relocating to a new city when you really don't have money? Also does anyone have advice/experience about relocating in general when you're looking at a place is across the country? Should I just stay where I am, try to find a new job, and save money? Should I be young and take chances.... ?

TL;DR Shitty job, no money saved. Looking for advice about new jobs and a potential relocation, maybe across the country.

After a long time of denial (I'm 26) I finally decided to confront my sexuality last month. After chasing an impossibly beautiful guy for half a year with no real success, I decide to make my murky way into grindr. At first it seemed really sleazy, and I felt intimidated because everyone (apart from me) seemed so so secure in their own sexuality. I was gonna delete and give up but then....
This really cool guy popped up! We started chatting and he was really funny, a couple years older than me but he had the game. We started chatting on watsapp and he was sending me funny voice recordings and stuff, probs sounds really pathetic but it put me at ease and made me feel comfortable. Anyway, he lived nearby so we decided to meet up for a drink. Things went even better in person. He explained that he was once in the closet too, and that he wasn't gonna put any pressure on me at all, that we could just be mates if I wanted.
Well I didn't want, lol. He was really good looking and nice and I was sure I wanted more than friendship with him, that I wanted him to be my 1st, but I was shy and worried how to go about it. I needn't have, he read me like a book.
I went round his flat one Friday night and he cooked me dinner (he can cook well.) We went upstairs and sat on his bed, and for ages we were just chatting over a beer. He started putting his hand on my thigh and stuff while we were talking, and it felt really good, but he didn't try kiss me yet. Over the next couple hours we got closer together, all the while with him not putting any undue pressure on me. 
I had to go pee, and when I came back he'd lit loads of candles and was just wearing a jock strap lol! Anyway, I won't go into detail but for the next few hours 26 years of pent up suppression was released, both mentally and physically! We wasn't a dick after either, really tactile and sweet.
My point is, I read a lot of bad stories about hook ups gone wrong from grindr, and I know there's a lot of sleazy guys on there. However, for me I think I used it in the right way. I mean, I'm still in the closet but would now consider myself to be a fully active bisexual male, and i'm confident and it's all down to this awesome guy.

So yesterday I went to Earth Day in Dallas and there were about 150 different tents hawking various things.  Among them were 7 or 8 groups trying to protect various animals and another 1/2 dozen or so specifically for rescuing dogs and it got me to thinking about the gay community in Dallas.  

When I actually moved into the city proper I joined a group that raises money for one of the many gay resources groups in the city.  I was proud of our group for raising $70k a year to support gay services and we are just one of 12 teams doing that.  I had always posted about how impressed I was with the number of gay groups in Dallas that provided services to the community.  

And then I met someone who needed those services.  I got a whole different take on what it was like as a gay man who needed to avail himself of the help.  According to him, and his opinion has been reinforced, availing yourself of all the resources we all spend our time raising money for is bureaucratic, time consuming, requires extensive traveling and is essential draining and demeaning.

During the AIDS Crisis the Dallas community pulled together and started organizations to overcome the lack of government response.  And we can be proud of that response but today we have multiple organizations all doing some of the same things with overlapping services and no one place a person in need can go to for everything they need.  So group 1 does A and B.  Group 2 does B and C, Group 3 does A, C and D and so on.  

And all of these groups have boards of directors, sometimes paid staff, fundraising events, supporters like me who join a team to do some good.  All of those bureaucracies have vested interests in the groups they support.  The community gives generously to all the hundreds of fundraisers that happen every week.  But if we could combine the missions and consolidate the groups and have one AIDS services group where all possible needs were met, wouldn't the $$ go farther?  

But how can I, a singular voice convince all these vested interests to give up power, jobs and prestige for the common good?  And the reason Earth Day got me thinking about this was that at that event there was basically the same thing going on.  All these separate groups to save a specific animal.  Wouldn't the earth be better off if they all banded together to save all the animals?

So bros, some advice.  Where do I begin?  ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the length of this post, in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I actually moved into the city proper I joined a group that raises money for one of the many gay resources groups in the city.  I was proud of our group for raising $70k a year to support gay services and we are just one of 12 teams doing that.  I had always posted about how impressed I was with the number of gay groups in Dallas that provided services to the community.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then I met someone who needed those services.  I got a whole different take on what it was like as a gay man who needed to avail himself of the help.  According to him, and his opinion has been reinforced, availing yourself of all the resources we all spend our time raising money for is bureaucratic, time consuming, requires extensive traveling and is essential draining and demeaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the AIDS Crisis the Dallas community pulled together and started organizations to overcome the lack of government response.  And we can be proud of that response but today we have multiple organizations all doing some of the same things with overlapping services and no one place a person in need can go to for everything they need.  So group 1 does A and B.  Group 2 does B and C, Group 3 does A, C and D and so on.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And all of these groups have boards of directors, sometimes paid staff, fundraising events, supporters like me who join a team to do some good.  All of those bureaucracies have vested interests in the groups they support.  The community gives generously to all the hundreds of fundraisers that happen every week.  But if we could combine the missions and consolidate the groups and have one AIDS services group where all possible needs were met, wouldn&amp;#39;t the $$ go farther?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how can I, a singular voice convince all these vested interests to give up power, jobs and prestige for the common good?  And the reason Earth Day got me thinking about this was that at that event there was basically the same thing going on.  All these separate groups to save a specific animal.  Wouldn&amp;#39;t the earth be better off if they all banded together to save all the animals?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So bros, some advice.  Where do I begin?  &lt;/p&gt;
