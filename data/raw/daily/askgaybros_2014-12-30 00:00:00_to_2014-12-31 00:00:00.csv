Before coming out I never had any connection to the gay community so it was pretty overwhelming when I began to surround myself with it. As immature and naive as I may have been I thought that the gay community consisted of effiminte guys, Lady Gaga, and glitter. Noone told me about the apps and the hook up culture that is associated with it, how small the gay community truly can be and the trials and tribulations of anal sex. 

That's only a brief snippet of what I've learned but I'm curious to know about your thoughts.

Coming out seemed somewhat easy, at least compared to what other people go through in terms of unaccepting family and/or friends. I just had the internal battle, everyone else seemed cool with it.

Now I'm uncomfortable again and I'm supposed to be happy. I've been with what seems like the most amazing guy for 1 month, but now something is bothering me. He recently told me that he's only let 3 other guys top him and it was uncomfortable enough for him to not want to try it again. So yeah, he will probably never bottom for me.

I consider myself somewhat versatile and will probably mostly adjust to my partners preference. I have no desire of being in a dom/sub relationship, I want to be with someone who considers me as their equal. I'm ok with sexual preferences and could probably do 1 thing more depending on what my partner wants, but the thought of never being able to top this guy is killing me. I might be younger, but I'm a man with a penis too so why shouldn't I get to use it once in a while?

I wouldn't want to change someones prefered sexual position, but is it so wrong that I want a compromise once in a while so I can feel equal? In my mind it's ridiculous that he would expose me to something he doesn't want done to himself at all, it just doesn't seem fair. I know topping shouldn't necessarily make one feel superior to the other, but let's be real, it's kind of a dominant position especially if you claim to strictly top. You see how that goes against my wish for an equal relationship?

You could tell me how bottoming can be dominant or how it's totally okay to strictly bottom, but I already know this, it just doesn't fit me (which is why this is more of a rant than a shout out for advice). I'd like to do both and the feeling of predicting an end to what seems like the perfect relationship is killing me. I can live with this for a while, but eventually It'll be too much for me to bottom everytime and I'll have to say bye and hunt for someone who's more versatile... AND THAT'S FUCKING SCARY BECAUSE I'VE REALLY FALLEN FOR THIS GUY!

It makes me sick to my stomach, I can't believe I've even been considering ending it, because ending such a great emotional bond over something as superficial as sex seems ridiculous, but in reality I know it will be an issue worth ending it over. I have little hope of him wanting to bottom for me, but I also know that some guys change this over time (I usually lurk here on another account), so it doesn't seem completely hopeless, yet... it kind fo feels hopeless.

I'm happy when I'm with him and time flies, but then when I have alone time I'm stuck in a stream of negative thoughts (I'm an introvert, dont' tell me to stop overthinking it, I can't) like this. I'm not sure where I'm going with this, please help?

This also happens when I'm about to top, and by the time I'm able to find the hole (which is incredibly difficult) I lose my hard on and can't get it up. Now I've gotten blowjobs before and finished, I've topped before and stayed hard throughout the whole thing, but recently I have been sexually frustrated, can't get it up, and usually just end up blowing the guy and he doesn't put the effort to help me and I won't finish.

Part of the reason I want to come out now (besides being fed up with having to hide everything) is that I'm turning 21 soon and think it will be easier for me to start meeting gay guys out at bars. 

I'm looking to hear some personal experiences and concrete tips on how to come out to my straight, very bro-y friends. I want to be able to tell them in a way that isn't too weird and emotional, but also gets the point across that this is a huge deal for me and I need them to have my back on this. One of my main fears in telling them is dealing with that discomfort some straight guys have when around gay guys - wondering if I'm going to hit on them, feeling awkward and uncomfortable about what I say and do, and all that other BS.

Thanks in advance for the advice, guys.

**P.S.** I'm also down to hear stories about navigating life the first couple months after coming out publicly. What changed, what didn't?

He had told me about this guy (Ben) in a club that he goes to that has been interested in him for a very long time but he has no interest in him. He had also told me that Ben groped him which he explain to Ben was unacceptable he has a boyfriend etc.

Fast forwards a few days...I get a text from Tom saying that Ben had given him an ultimatum. If Tom were to send Ben a naked picture he would leave him alone and in his infinite wisdom he complied and sent the picture. You can imagine my reaction.

This is the third time he has hurt me and though he has never betrayed me I was angry and I wanted to hurt him. I decided in my own infinite wisdom to turn to grindr it was easy enough to find a guy to talk to we sent some pictures and that was that. I instantly regretted it. When he found out he got upset and I felt like an absolute asshole though it did bring him down to my level.  

He came over the following day and we had a long talk during which we discussed a lot of things. As a sign of faith he showed me texts between a few guys who had sent him pictures. He had replied saying he has a boyfriend etc which did give me a sense of security. He also admitted that he had a curiosity about how this guys dick looked which helped motivate his decision no doubt. We argued even more gained some common ground but ultimately I told him that I wanted to break up with him. There is only so much you can pull a relationship back from and with so much drama in such a short time I couldn't see a happy future with him. He told me that he forgave me for what I had done (which is a worse act than he committed) and that he really didn't want to break up but I still found it hard to move on. 

Now comes the complicated part I've been friends with a guy which we will call James for a while now we had spoken on grindr but he never showed any interest and so we remained friend. We went out for coffee every now and then and he would often advice me when it came to issue in my relationship. After telling him about my possible breakup he admitted that he had feelings for me. This guy really is incredible, intelligent, successful and, handsome. We get along really well I would say better than me and Tom do and I can imagine having a happy relationship with him. 

I still have a lot of feelings for Tom he was my first and we have shared some nice moment but I don't know if there is any future between us.

I hope some of you fitness-minded bros can help me out.

So I'm a pretty skinny guy--about 5'11"" and 133-ish pounds--and I've been hitting the gym pretty hard over the past year and a half or so, but I've had a really hard time putting on muscle. It's not for lack of working out--I'm doing every machine I can get my hands on, as well as bodyweight exercises--but I have a stupid ridiculously fast metabolism and I find it extremely difficult to eat enough to keep my caloric intake at a point where I would start gaining mass. I'd also like to maybe use a protein supplement, but--surprise!--I'm allergic to milk and can't use any whey-based (or generally any animal-based) protein supplements (because most of them contain milk byproducts, even if they aren't whey).

Do any of you guys who have dealt with this sort of thing before have any tips for how I might modify my diet / vegan protein supplements I might look into / some other tips I've overlooking? I've already stopped running thanks to my friend's advice, so that should help me out a little, but I really want to put on some muscle and I'm finding it really, really, REALLY difficult.

Thanks in advance, guys. I appreciate any help you might give.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey bros,&lt;/p&gt;

I figured i'd get more/better answers if i posted here. Myself (early 20's year old gay dude) and my good friend (early 20's year old straightbro) are going to be spending New Years together. We live in Los Angeles and i was planning on going to the designated gay part of town, West Hollywood (for the first time), by myself. Then i found out he was going to be by himself with no plans for New Years at home alone cause his best friend went to Vegas without him. So i offered him to come hang with me. He's down to do whatever. Initially when it was going to be just me, i was just going to go to West Hollywood and wander around and see what i saw and go where ever seemed appealing. 

However, now that i have someone coming with me, i want to have a bit more of a plan/specific destination. I want to have a good time and i want him to have as good a time as possible considering this is a backup plan for him. Even though he's straight, he's more than ok with us LGBT people. Most of his family is LGBT. His dad's gay, his brother is gay, his sister is bisexual and two of his cousins are gay. Funny enough, admittedly, i have a small crush on the dude. Figures i'd be into the one straight guy in the family haha, it's pretty hilarious to me. Anyway, that's a whole other post. 

But yeah, so i'm just wondering if any L.A. bros have any suggestions on where we can go or what New Years events are going on in WeHo that are fun but won't be too much for him (or me honestly).

I have a weird question, and I guess you can't really answer it for me, but I'm hoping to get another perspective.  Sorry for the long story:

A guy who I've seen and interacted with on a limited basis sporadically over the past couple of years (he's a bus driver on one of my routes), always very friendly and cheerful to everyone, one day out of nowhere handed me a slip of paper with his number and said to please call or text, right as I got off the bus.  Keep in mind that he's middle aged, maybe 50s early 60s (though I'm a poor judge), and I'm 28 but look considerably younger than that, pocket-sized, young face.

I saw him again the next week and he brought it up, said something about how he was hoping I would call, and I mumbled something about no thanks, I'm not interested and have a monogamous partner, whatever.  As I left the bus, he reiterated that he hoped I would call or text, that he just wanted ""to talk about something,"" ""just talk,"" etc. etc., 

I ddin't call or text; it felt like he just wanted to pick up a young guy, and I couldn't think of another reason why he would give me his number.  It seemed weird and unexpected and kinda pushy, especially from someone who always came off as very nonthreatening and friendly to *all* of his passengers.

So the next time I saw him a couple of weeks later, I was prepared to get more firm and suggest he was being inappropriate (I just want to get home, dammit), but he handed me a folded up piece of paper and said to read it, it was an explanation.

I read the note.  It basically detailed that he had been in the closet his whole life due to fear of beatings, that he was scared try to meet guys at bars or online, and that he felt like he didn't know how to ""be gay,"" how to meet guys, or what things mean in gay culture.  He wrote that I seemed so nice and that he'd wanted to talk to me for the past couple of years, that he'd appreciate it if he could get lunch or coffee with my partner and me to talk, answer questions, help guide him, that he respected I was in a relationship and he just wanted some help.  He said if I wasn't willing, to please give his number to another nice person who might be willing to help.

So maybe I'm overthinking, but what's your instinct?  Does this seem sincere?  If you were in that position, would you reach out to some random gay guy half, less than half your age?  Or do you think it's just somebody looking for a hookup with a young dude?  If he's being genuine I'd like to try to point him somewhere that could help, but it just feels strange, and I don't want to encourage anything else or get into a weird situation.  Am I being paranoid?

**TL;DR - Much older, more-or-less stranger reaches out to me strongly on the premise of feeling scared to come out as gay late in life and wanting help; is he likely to be genuine or a creeper?**

EDIT:  Thanks all.  Sounds like the consensus is that I'm being paranoid.  I've been in some bad situations before, so that might make me a little overly cautious.  I just shot the guy a text, hopefully I can be helpful to him.  Thanks for the advice!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys,&lt;/p&gt;

It's going great for the most part, but the most annoying thorn in my side about the relationship is his friendships with other gay men. 

Basically, he has two ex-boyfriends, both of which he's still good friends with. He also has a very close best friend, also gay. That's all well and good in and of itself, but his behavior with them often crosses the line into romantic in a way that makes me uncomfortable.

With one ex-boyfriend, he's shown me a couple of texts between them, and the way they talk to each other is just quite romantic to my ears. Sentimental banter, pet names, etc. They've hung out twice since my boyfriend and I have been together - the first time, the guy came onto him and my boyfriend had to reject him. The second time, my boyfriend said that they had a bit of a moment of sexual tension, but that they just laughed it off and left it at that.

My boyfriend and his best friend will also often share a bed - my boyfriend will take a night away from me once every couple of weeks to stay the night at his best friend's house. They even cuddle a bit. And it just really hits me a bit hard when my boyfriend decides to go spend the night in another man's bed instead of mine. Taking a guy's night out is more than okay, but making a point of spending the night in his bed (and not just he was too drunk to make it back home or something) bothers me. 

I could go on, but suffice it to say that it's stuff like this that is the issue. 

I've brought this all up with him a couple times, but he doesn't seem to understand why this all becomes bothersome. He seems to think that I'm just worried about him cheating, and he assures me that he's loyal and that he tells me about all of this so that we don't have any secrets and so on. But the way he behaves with other gay men just bothers me in and of itself, even though I do trust him not to cheat, and that's what he doesn't seem to understand. 

He has said that he will stop doing anything that makes me uncomfortable if I want, but I'm reluctant to just bark out orders at him - I'd rather that he understand why this stuff bothers me. Basically, I want to start a dialogue with him to make it clear that my concerns aren't coming from a lack of trust, but that this just isn't stuff someone in a committed relationship should be doing. But it's hard for me to explain why that is. 

Can someone who is better with feelings and words than I am help me articulate this?

So please let me know if I should move it elsewhere. Anyhow, it's been an interesting week so far.

I was on OkCupid for like a year and a half. A lot of the same guys in the area that claim to be ""into relationships"" are also on Grindr with mixed desires (some, but not all of them, are looking for ""right now."")

I'm glad I have no qualms about ignoring messages. I've received eight so far. Four of them were obviously fishing for my phone number (non-local phone numbers.) Another didn't have a pic, another guy kept bugging me and didn't use proper language, and another was a ""right now discreet no relationship"" guy. The last guy seemed normal and I've had decent conversations with him.

I've only messaged one other guy because I recognized where he took his pic (it was obscure, and very close to where I live.) He thought that was cool, but I didn't really continue further.

Most of the guys messaging me seem to be the 300+ pound guys. I guess that if you don't fit the traditionally attractive mold, you have to try harder. Also, things seem relatively clean so far - no commenting on body parts, asking for more than face pics (or pics at all), or anything that could potentially make me uncomfortable.

In summary, I plan on keeping Grindr for now, as long as I don't take it too seriously or care that much about whether I'm meeting other guys on it.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure whether I should post this here, since it&amp;#39;s not a question, but I think it&amp;#39;s not really relevant the main Gaybros.
