Thought I'd share this with you all to make sure I'm not over reacting but I went on a casual date tonight and to be honest I'm surprised I survived the trip.

Before I start I am not a back seat driver or one of those people that freaks out about every little mistake that people make by driving BUT...

So the guy comes to pick me up at my house and we set out to drive to the movies which is about a 30 minute drive away. Now I live in a relatively rural area dominated by one lane roads. You know, the ones you always go down and seem to be trapped behind the grandma doing 30 in a 55. Yep, that was us. But hey, when it's a stop sign we're not going that fast so he can stop in time right? Wrong. 9/10 times he would wait till the very last second and SLAM on the brakes. Like full blow seat belts lock up and ABS going insane slam. Only to stop some 10+ feet pass the line, practically half way through the intersection. 

Well surely things would get better once we got on the Interstate. Nope. We merged right on with a healthy speed of 40mph with Semis blowing past us. We ever so slowly climb up to 80mph but it only gets worse. We're cutting people off and turn signals are non existent. We cut off a tractor trailer and I swear I thought we were going to get run over. But the best part has yet to come. We're in the far left lane and our exit is coming up in a quarter mile. So what does this guy do? Turns on the turn signal but proceeds to cross 5 FUCKING LANES in one huge dive and in the process cuts off a [5 ton military truck](http://armytrucksinc.com/wp-content/gallery/inventory/5.%20CARGO%20TRUCKS/002.jpg) and goes right through the [gore point](http://media.komonews.com/images/gore_point.jpg) on the exit. Then we finally pull into the parking lot and he starts driving around and texting. He is about to run a stop sign with people in the intersection and is looking down at his phone so I straight up reach down and yank the parking brake to stop us. He freaks out and apologizes and I brush it off. I just want out. 

We watch the movie and all is fine but on the ride home it's basically the same story. But at the end of this rant lies my question.

Meaning, he goes out and talks to other guys (usually instagram, facebook, snapchat, with other *gay* guys)

We've been FWB for about 4 years and dating the last 3 months (we're both going to be rooming together at university).

Back to the problem, he ""flirts with anything that moves"".  How do I deal with this/make it stop?  

The most recent example, tonight, he accidentally sent a smiling snapchat of himself to me with some message, obviously not meant for me, as he was very mad at me tonight.  He was mad because I was the only one that did not send him a sweet morning text and that mine was immediately asking him to do something.  So because he was mad at me, he was snapchatting happily with other men.

Often this flirting is a result of the two of us having a dispute of some sort and I believe he uses it as a getaway.  He absolves himself among other men, while I remain completely loyal to him.  

But in general, the flirting is non-stop.  Even when we're together he is texting/snapchatting an ex-boyfriend as well as several random men.  A few of them are local to us.

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve been FWB for about 4 years and dating the last 3 months (we&amp;#39;re both going to be rooming together at university).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to the problem, he &amp;quot;flirts with anything that moves&amp;quot;.  How do I deal with this/make it stop?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most recent example, tonight, he accidentally sent a smiling snapchat of himself to me with some message, obviously not meant for me, as he was very mad at me tonight.  He was mad because I was the only one that did not send him a sweet morning text and that mine was immediately asking him to do something.  So because he was mad at me, he was snapchatting happily with other men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often this flirting is a result of the two of us having a dispute of some sort and I believe he uses it as a getaway.  He absolves himself among other men, while I remain completely loyal to him.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in general, the flirting is non-stop.  Even when we&amp;#39;re together he is texting/snapchatting an ex-boyfriend as well as several random men.  A few of them are local to us.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What should I do?&lt;/p&gt;

My apologies if it is.  I don't use reddit very often, but if you click on my name you'll see my only other post was a wishey washey diatribe about being in love with my straight best friend.  I reread it tonight and cringed.  Who is that sad indecisive kid?  Since then I have changed a lot and have become more confident with who I am(not completely confident though, I'll explain).   

In my last post, I still thought i was Bi.  After sleeping with several girls last year and hating it, I can confidently say that I am gay.  However, I had still never been with a man and had no gay friends (this was still in college).  So like any curious, horny gay man, I turned to Grindr.  I hooked up once.  Nothing huge, just hand and mouth stuff.  I felt so disgusting afterwords that I vowed never to use the damn thing again.  I'm too STD paranoid, and to be honest kind of a prude.  Don't get me wrong though, in the moment I was digging it. It's the sexual experience I replay in my mind all the time.

Here's the problem.  I left college, moved to a new city with a new job (woo hoo!!).  I was excited to meet new people and find a new friend group, hopefully some new gay friends that could ease me into this new world.  That didn't end up being the case.  I found myself slinking back to my old ways and hanging out with straight guys and women(mostly other new hires I worked with).  Everyone assumes I'm straight and I never feel the need to come out to them.  I feel like (especially with straight guys) it ruins the relationship to come out.  Once you do, in most of my experiences, the relationship changes in some way(usually negative).  This is especially true with friends that I have recently met, they naturally become more standoffish and the friendship suffers or is broken.  The other reason, I don't is because I hate the gay stereotype.  I don't' want to be fierce and go shopping with you.  Most flamboyant people in general, turn me off (not just gay).  That may sound ignorant and it probably is.  I like hanging out with masculine guys. I get along best with ""bros"" but at the end of the day, I want to sleep with them as well.  I keep falling into the same cycle of becoming great friends with fun guys (and gals) that I love hanging out with but never being able to take it any further.  Life is made for two and I'm tired of coming home to an empty apartment.

Any advice for meeting other gaybros?  Do you find that it's easier to come out to some of your straight friends? I know what your going to say right, ""they're not really your friends if they can't accept you the way you are"" but that's kind of bullshit.  I've always heard the saying that guys and girls cant ""just be friends."" Someone allays develops feelings.  I found that to be true with me and my straight friends (literally all my friends are straight).  But if I tell them how I feel or how I am, they will treat me differently.  These people who I love hanging out with will now feel awkward sitting next to me when we're both drunk.  I know this is a progressive world and that may not be the case with some people, but it's definitely a minority.  If you had the same situation where two straight single people were drunk and alone (a guy and girl), I feel like someone will try and make a move, especially if they know each other well.  I think this is why my relationships with straight guys gets awkward when I come out, they think i'm going to try to make a move.  They also see me differently, and I'm no longer the guy they call when they have an extra ticket to a ballgame.  Idk, maybe i'm ignorant and don't have enough trust in my relationships with people.  

I hate Grindr, I hate gay clubs/bars.  How do I break the cycle of falling in love with straight friends and then getting wildly frustrated when I know they will never be able to take a relationship to the next level.  How do I meet gaybros?

Any advice is helpful.  If you read this thank you!  It feels good just to get all my frustrations down.

They treat me like I'm a human being instead of just another model and the unhotties seem to be, on average, more interested in education and being a good person. It's a generalization, but it's based on my experience.

But does it mean I'm weird or conceited to think this way? I told a friend and he actually got mad at me, saying I'm conceited for believing I'm so good that I'm a godsend to men like this.

I really want to go for it (and be safe of course), but am held back by the fact that I&amp;#39;m a virgin.  If I were not, I would have no problems hooking up with guys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this sounds weird, but I&amp;#39;m confused about what I want.&lt;/p&gt;

I just graduated from college in May, and moved to Atlanta after. I’ve been living in Atlanta for about 2 months now.  I don't know many people here now and I guess the honest truth is I'm lonely as hell.  

So I matched with this guy on Tinder, and we'd been talking for a couple months.  Things were great. Then I drive to meet him, he gets us a hotel room for the night, we did basically have sex on our first night together which I regret more than life itself right now. Though we both enjoyed it, and he was the one who put it in(all the way at least), I can't help but feel that this was a huge mistake.  I head home the next day after an amazing night, and after then he realizes that he has feelings for this boyfriend that he has which was the first time that he mentions that he even has a boyfriend.  His boyfriend is currently studying abroad overseas for the next 3 months and has been gone for the past couple months.  They talked about taking a break before he started studying abroad.

He (the guy I met) says that he feels horrible and guilty since they've dated a couple months before he met me, and I finally asked him what he wanted with me then and if he had feelings for me anymore.  He responded that his feelings for the guy he was dating are clouding his judgment right now and that he thinks we should take things a few steps back right now, back to a platonic relationship.  

I'm depressed as hell and don't know what to say to this.  Should I stick around for this guy and just see how things go, or move on? How should I read this situation?  I do want what would be best for them and if he truly does want this guy then he should stay with him, but if only one night with me makes him seriously consider the relationship with his bf, then it seems to me like he would probably enjoy a relationship with me a bit more. 

What should I do?
