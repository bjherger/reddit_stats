Need advice.**

First, some context. I work with this guy and we get on well as peers at work. We became closer when he and his girlfriend broke up and he wanted to focus more on his friendships. Sometimes we hang out after work, either in a group setting or just by ourselves. This usually entails going to the pub just to talk, or driving around, or playing some basketball, or jogging together, or getting a massage (but not together). Normal bro stuff, right?

Overall he's pretty conservative and even though we live in a big city, I am the only gay guy he currently knows and the first he's befriended. Conservative as in he likes traditional gender roles and he doesn't think [straight] guys should even hug unless under duress. We also live in a more conservative neighborhood of the city. While we have different views on things, he does believe in equality and treats me the same as he does everyone else, so he's a bit uptight, but not homophobic. And while I do think he's quite attractive, I am not pining for him. I've told him he's a good catch for a lucky girl, and it's his ex's loss, and I mean it. I value him as a friend.

However, sometimes he acts like... more than a friend? It doesn't happen all the time, but for example: if we're out (either by ourselves or with friends) he'll order for both of us, and just us. If I mention that I want this steak or that beer while we are poring over menus, he'll give the waiter both our orders. Sometimes he won't even ask, and he'll order for both of us off the bat, and let other people order for themselves. Not because it's my favorite or my usual, he just thinks it's what I'd like. It's actually kind of sweet, and I don't mind this gesture so much.

He's more upfront with seating arrangements though, and this is something he does way more often. ""Go sit over there,"" he'll tell me, and eventually he'll come over and take his seat next to me. Sometimes he'll even maneuver me in a direction and give me a little push. Or if I'm joining him late and he's seated with our friends, he'll beckon me over and tell me, ""Come sit here,"" with the same tone he'd use to tell me to shut the door when I'm at his place. Not sexual, not condescending, just matter-of-fact and expected to be followed. Again, just me. 

We were both working today and he wanted us to take our break at the same time. I wanted to finish something up first. ""Come sit here,"" he tells me. I was lingering because I really wanted to finish the task I was working on. ""Hey!"" he suddenly yells at me. ""I said get over here. I want your buns in this seat, *now*."" He was completely serious. This was the first time he's raised his voice like that, but this was also the first time I didn't do what he told me to immediately. He let it go after I told him to bugger off, and I went over and sat down when I saw he wasn't going to push it.

There are a couple other instances of him acting like I'm his bitch (like telling me to get his jacket), but those two I mentioned above are the most consistent behaviors. Oh, and his nickname for me is boi with an i, like Jimmy-boi or Tommy-boi. I don't think he knows it's a diminutive, and also, I don't mind.

You might ask why I didn't say something sooner. It's because, until that last outburst, the thing is, when he's acting like he's the boss of me... there's something in me that resonates with that. I don't mind and I just do it without thinking. I know, I'm fucked up. Now, there's something exciting and flattering about being treated like I'm his (hey I've been single for a while), but I also feel conflicted because he is straight straight straight and we are not boyfriends. I wouldn't mind this with a boyfriend that I trust, but we haven't even hugged!

I just think it's a weird dynamic, and I'm not quite sure how to deal with it before it becomes straight up awkward. Maybe I'm just tripping (and I'm sure you guys will let me know), maybe he has issues, maybe something else. Any advice?
 
*Edited to add:*

To clarify, I guess what I'm looking for advice on is... Should I talk to him and point out that this behavior is not ""normal"" between friends? Does he do this because he thinks gay guys are like girls? (Because that would be offensive) Is he genuinely curious? Is he doing this just because he can? Again, he's straight and I do want us to remain friends, so I don't want to say or do the wrong thing.

And more to the point, even though secretly he's pushing the right kinky buttons, I don't want him to start doing anything improper at work, ya know? We have clients, and subordinates, and upper management bosses to deal with.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr: Sometimes straight friend acts like he&amp;#39;s my master.

Sorry about this post. Im just having a shitty time and I wanted some people to talk to. 

Now where to begin, I've been having an off semester at school, (I'm a sophomore) and ive recently been coming out and all of that good stuff (to friends, havent talked to my parents about it) but I dont feel much better overall. I've been looking around with nothing to really show for it. There is this guy in my class that I like that i've been talking with more in class, but im not really sure what's going on as he is friendly and makes a lot of eye contact when talking with me, but once we were leaving the building after class he quickly said bye and bolted. I think I may have been reading into it too much as I can be pretty insecure when it comes to this kind of stuff. Especially since he is super attractive and sweet (also he is gay so no worries in that department), while im a mess that can look decent when i put myself together. I've never had any luck in dating (#foreveralone), but my friends and family always talk about what a catch i am and they dont understand why ive never been seeing anyone. Well some of them dont know why lol. Sometimes when i'm reading gaybros posts about happy couples and cute things guys do for their boyfriends I just start crying because i feel like i will never have that. Maybe im a bit rough around the edges. I get super awkward and choked up around people i'm interested in.

Also, I feel like i've just been in a rut. I have been feeling pretty shitty overall. My grades have been suffering a bit and i've just been a bit withdrawn from my friends. Another problem is that i feel like i'm just waiting for some real friends that truly get me. People who want to do interesting and fun things with their lives. That is why I came out here to NYC. I just feel pretty alone even when i have all of these people around me. Maybe i'm depressed? Im not sure. I fluctuate between being super positive and out there and being pretty negative and recluse. 

TL;DR 20 yr old college student who has issues finding/attracting other guys and is just in a bit of a rut. Any advice would help. 

Sorry for the rant, any hopeful words would be appreciated. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys! Sorry about this post. Im just having a shitty time and I wanted some people to talk to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now where to begin, I&amp;#39;ve been having an off semester at school, (I&amp;#39;m a sophomore) and ive recently been coming out and all of that good stuff (to friends, havent talked to my parents about it) but I dont feel much better overall. I&amp;#39;ve been looking around with nothing to really show for it. There is this guy in my class that I like that i&amp;#39;ve been talking with more in class, but im not really sure what&amp;#39;s going on as he is friendly and makes a lot of eye contact when talking with me, but once we were leaving the building after class he quickly said bye and bolted. I think I may have been reading into it too much as I can be pretty insecure when it comes to this kind of stuff. Especially since he is super attractive and sweet (also he is gay so no worries in that department), while im a mess that can look decent when i put myself together. I&amp;#39;ve never had any luck in dating (#foreveralone), but my friends and family always talk about what a catch i am and they dont understand why ive never been seeing anyone. Well some of them dont know why lol. Sometimes when i&amp;#39;m reading gaybros posts about happy couples and cute things guys do for their boyfriends I just start crying because i feel like i will never have that. Maybe im a bit rough around the edges. I get super awkward and choked up around people i&amp;#39;m interested in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I feel like i&amp;#39;ve just been in a rut. I have been feeling pretty shitty overall. My grades have been suffering a bit and i&amp;#39;ve just been a bit withdrawn from my friends.

Well actually I guess it's more correct to say he came out last year to most people - I was the last person he told. He told me he thought I was gonna react badly so he didn't say anything which is understandable. Of course I would never treat him any differently because he's gay; he's my best friend, my brother and being gay is just a part of who he is. 

The thing is even though he's told me he's gay we never really talk about anything that might be gay related - if that makes sense. I ask questions - like regular friend questions cause I want to know how my friend is - but he always just changes the topic. For example there was this guy that hung out with us maybe a dozen times this summer and someone asked me how my friend was dealing with the breakup. Apparently they were at that stage where you're not really official yet but were heading that way and then they 'broke up'. I don't know I just think it's strange that he would invite the guy he's dating/sleeping with to hang out with us (or maybe it was me to hang out with them?) and wouldn't tell me thats how it was. 

He's got a group of gay friends, which is cool for him. I've met a few of them, they seem like cool people. The thing is sometimes he'll tell me something one of them said and when I ask about he just says 'you wouldn't understand cause your not gay'. I know that there's probably a lot I can't relate to or don't get yet - but I'm willing to learn. I'll admit its probably a bit of jealousy (i don't think that's really the word i want but i can't think of the right one) on my part that these guys he met this summer are closer to him than i am. 

Do you think I should try and talk to him about this? At the same time I recognize that this is his journey in life and he should do it how he feels most comfortable. he had his reasons for coming out to me last and he has his reasons for not wanting to talk about anything that might deal with him being gay with me. I don't think we're as close as we were earlier in the year - and I think that might have something to do with the fact that a major part of his life is just unknown to me.

The consensus...was confusing. Most people said they thought his music taste was awesome, but that really the question he asked. The OP wasn't ashamed of his music taste regardless if It was ""gay"" or not, he just wanted to know if it was what people would consider stereotypically gay.

Another thing I thought was interesting is that one person did say that he thought his music taste was gay despite listing some bands I don't associate with being stereotypical at all (Arctic Monkeys, Foster the People, alt-J, etc.) So that begs the question: what do **you** feel is stereotypically gay music?

For me personally, I always thought pop music was under that category. People like Rihanna, Katy Perry, Sam Smith, etc. There's nothing wrong with liking those artists, and I obviously don't believe all gay men like those (I'm more of a garage rock guy myself), I'm just saying that if I had to pick what a stereotypical gay man would listen to, I would pick those artists.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other day I read a thread here from someone asking if his music taste was &amp;quot;gay&amp;quot; or not. &lt;/p&gt;

After all of this, he tells me he's HIV+, undetectable, but positive... I remained calm and said okay (it still is very selfish to not disclose his status and very stupid of me not to ask beforehand) but I've always worn a condom so I didn't think, so after this I was in shock and I didn't ask all the right questions. I am fairly informed of HIV, and the highest risk of infection was ruled out with me wearing a condom, but the anxiety comes and goes, should I really be worried about the oral sex? 



Edit. THANK YOU ALL, so very much, I am much, much calmer now, I talked to him about his status and situation, and I've decided that if I do continue this relationship with this guy, we won't be having sex until he's back on his treatment and he gets new results that prove he's undetectable and his retrovirals are at the lowest; and of course I'll find a clinic that can provide me PrEP on a regular basis, all of this as an addition to always wearing a rubber. Thank you all, educating yourself truly makes it a lot easier to handle this kind of situations. All of this if he agrees, if not then he can find someone else who agrees with his practices.

Edit 2. FUCK THIS GUY. I went to the clinic and the doctor said I have nothing to worry about, I was completely safe and always have been, I just need to be extra careful when it comes to oral hygiene and oral sex. Also, I discussed this with one of my closest friends and he said it might be a possibility that this ASS made all of this up just to get rid of me, given that he hasn't said a word since the hookup and from what he told me, he seems to have no idea what he's talking about when it comes to HIV (I didn't mention that he said he had been told oral wasn't risky at all and it was all taboo) but I didn't noticed all this could be mumbo-jumbo until after I did the research and read all of your well informed replies, awesome guys in the internet... So wether he was indeed positive or not, I'm glad I wore a condom and I now will be even more careful when it comes to oral sex.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;m a little anxious about this, last night I had sex for the first time with this guy I&amp;#39;ve been sore of dating, he practiced oral sex on me, I did on him, I rimmed him, he lays on me, teases the head of my penis in his hole, never goes in, and then I topped (wearing a condom of course), I cum in his mouth, he cums on himself.
