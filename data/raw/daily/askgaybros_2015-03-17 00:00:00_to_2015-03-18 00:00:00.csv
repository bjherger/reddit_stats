Hey bros, to keep it simple, I'm just tired of hooking up...I realized that last night. I had a hook up, honestly I was just horny and was looking get take a load off lol. That's really all I wanted. The guy however wanted to make out with me, lick me everywhere, rub me everywhere, finger me...etc. and I was just grossed out (not that anything was wrong with the guy, he was actually really hot, 40's, nice tan, toned body) in the middle of it. I genuinely did not want this man touching me. He jerked me and I made my self cum out of sheer just wanting to leave, I didn't really enjoy it... I jerked him till he came and I left right after.

I've been on these website and apps now for some 5 years, and have been hooking up for that long. I'm just really tired of going to someone's house and on my way thinking ""man, this guy could be a serial killer, I may never come back home."" (that's really just me thinking dramatically lol) and then while we're going at it I dont wanna do too much or go too far because of the risk of STDs and it's like, ""I don't really know this person, I don't want to put his penis in my mouth or vice versa.""  When I hook up, we are really only do some kissing, some body contact, mostly mutual JO, and if we are really feeling each other and have met more then 2-3 times, we blow each other...that's as far as far as my hook ups go. I'm really tired of my over-paranoid self and freak out every time I have a larger than normal lump or pimple anywhere on my body and think it's some kind of STD. 

But I'm really just tired of it, I want to find someone that I can actually date and enjoy their company, someone who I can have some crazy wild amazing sex with and not have to worry that this person is a complete stranger, someone I can spend all night in their arms, and then have breakfast together in the morning, someone to take an awesome vacation with...etc

I've been on these sites and apps like I said for some 5 years now, and I more or less know everyone (either have met them or have seen their online profile) and I kinda just see what's out there, and straight up I'm just really not interested in any guys here. Out of every 20 guys, there is maybe 1 that I think is really cool, but something always ends up coming up and we just kinda gradually stop talking....and it's so funny, 1 out of every 20. I live in Miami, you would think the pool of guys would be much bigger, but it's just not. (as a matter of fact, a guy I hooked up with once before, we still talk every now and then on the apps, was venting to me the very same thing i'm venting about now) Living in Miami, there is a sort of lifestyle that 90% of the gays here follow, this fake-pretentious-bullshit-high-class-south-beach-tanned-muscle with some flamboyancy....and it's like fuck that. I'm SO NOT about that life. I'm a real authentic regular guy, I prefer eating and having drinks at a chilis rather than some pretentious lounge or club, I like working out, I like action sports, movies, comics, anime, video games, toilet humor...etc

I really just wanted to vent...but guess my question is, how can I go about meeting actual guys of substance who are cool down to earth guys, for dating with out thee damn apps and websites","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;(slight wall of text, sorry lol) &lt;/p&gt;

I wholeheartedly do. We've been together for over a year now. But we are beginning to face issues that I seriously doubt I can put up for long (and my threshold is pretty damn high). I used such a stupid title because I am beginning to feel just that. Stupid!

We were crazy and stupid in love (we are 29 and 31 now -not so young clearly). He hated Dubai where we lived and so we decided together to move to the US by doing the whole K-1 visa (we are gay). Shortly after we started the application process he lost his job, due to him not going to work. We worked out a lot of our issues and have overcome a lot of problems. But our most persisting has been our stark contrasts of roles to fill and financial problems. For example, after we agreed to do the application, I discovered he had over $15,000 in credit card debt that I had to pay off since he was broke and out of work. He was in jail for a day until I bailed him (because he insisted he wants to travel to see his parents before clearing his debts and he got held at the airport).

Basically him not working left the whole burden of the visa application and the bread winning on my part. The visa is not only expensive but also required me to save a large amount of money in a short period of time. Furthermore, I was planning our future together and trying to make sure we have enough savings to last us during the move (as we both would be out of work). I always felt a bit annoyed by the fact that he wanted to play first and work secondly. Furthermore, he was not always helpful with finances, there were a few times I felt he put me in a difficult situation.
Anyway, nonetheless, I ignored all the signs and went ahead with the process. We made the jump and moved to the US, despite me leaving behind in Dubai a really well paying job (over $82,000 and totally tax-free) as well as a promotion. We moved here a month and a half ago and have not stopped fighting since!
He has disagreed with all of my tactics to remain frugal. And he is always the eternal optimist (it's actually begin to verge on the plain stupid, really) thinking that the universe works his way. He really expected to get his work authorization ASAP (even though I explained the process step by step to him). Then we received a letter from Immigration asking me to prove that I have work to keep my husband here. Sadly because my husband again was overtly optimistic he refused to listen to my cost cutting measures and insisted on living in an apartment on our own...anyway, my point is that even though I explained everything to him and stuck to the plan he always tries to veer off just to satisfy his emotions or whims. His mistakes are becoming really taxing and are beginning to hurt our relationship. I really cannot think of a week where we didn't have a big issue. I am just exhausted. At this point, I am just thinking of how can I help him stay in the US so he can live his dream and then he can pay me back for the loans I covered and he can just leave me alone in peace.

I am really exhausted, and I realize that I made this decision and by staying I also reaffirmed that decision. I own my mistake. But I need words of wisdom, objectivity and some logic to remain at least reasonable, decent and fair.

What are your thoughts? Am I wrong to feel this way? Am I being harsh and cruel? I am not sure where to go from here and the love is beginning to taste bitter....

It's a ridicuolus statement, it's just a fucking activity, but it's true.


What do they offer besides working out, orgies? threesomes? dildos?
In my country (south american here) straight people notice that too, and they make jokes on twitter and stuff.

I was watching Looking when they made a joke about juice cleansing and CrossFit so... i guess it's global ... like a gay cult.

I'm just not feeling it. I like someone who radiates passion and enjoyment. I want to hear them coo under me. I want their toes to curl.

Now I've already taken a step to fix this. We had a talk and come to find out he had no idea this was even an issue (1 point for communication).

So after reading the advice you guys gave (which I am very thankful for), I decided to show up unannounced at his house. 

It took a while for him to open up a little and he was pretty nervous. He would not make eye contact in the beginning and was fidgety. But I explained to him that this stuff happens all the time and there's nothing to be embarrassed about (after which he blurted out a gazillion ""im so sorry""ies). I talked to him for about 20 minutes before he would start asking me ""but do you like me?"" while I was talking, I tried to ignore it and carry on with what I was saying hoping he'd understand by the end, but that didn't happen. After about an hour of talking I was about to leave and he asks me full on if I liked him or not, and I honestly did not know what to say. All I could think of was ""Yes I like you, we're good friends"" and I left it at that and went home. I texted my friend, told him his brother was just feeling uneasy about something and everything's cool. Didn't go into any specifics. 

I think it's safe to say everything went fine. I'm glad I came here before actually going to talk to him, it gave me a better insight as to how he might have been feeling. He finally texted me an hour ago saying ""thanks for that, see you at the gym tomorrow"". 

So that's that. Thanks for all your help guys, much appreciated!

A bit of context first. I´m 19 yo and I'm in 4th semester in med school. I've never been the kind of guy (yes, I'm a male) to have a lot of friends, I mean I'm not shy or anything, I just kind of like being on my own. It all changed last semester, I didn't have many friends on school, so I go into this class not knowing more than 2-3 people, and there's a group of friends (like 6 of them) and they are kind of ""popular"", my natural reaction is to dislike them, I don't know why, I just do. Without realizing they all start talking to me and I guess I really liked them because they invite me to parties and such.

Anyway, in this group there's this guy, we'll call him Gus, he's good looking, and he's always more ""insistive"" than the others on his group, like for example once we all went to have a drink and this guy was like: ""I wanna sit next to OP"" and stuff like that. That freaked me out a bit because I just don't get that reaction from people that much very often, like never. I started looking at him different because of this, I guessed I misinterpreted the whole thing and I developed a crush on him.

Now I'm not out, only a few friends know about my sexual orientation. Gus' straight and I'm very bad at picking signals like that so I just threw the idea away. Months pass by, we become best friends, I become more outgoing, I even started drinking alcohol and such, he invites me over to his house often, and we just grew very, very close, I even told him about me being gay. At first he thought I was kidding, I was nervous he'd stop talking to me, but he accepted it and we grew even closer because now I could talk about me freely with him.

Through all this I fell in love hard, and I talked about that with other friends, John and Ana, we all four are very close, we all decided that it's not a very good idea to tell him how I feel, because even though he is comfortable with my sexual orientation, he may find it awkward being around me.

Keep in mind I've always known he's straight and I know nothing can happen between us, nor I want anything to happen, I appreciate his friendship a lot. But it hurts anyways, knowing that, he's the first person I've liked (loved?) ever and with whom I'd be willing to have a relationship. 

In the past two months it's only gotten worse, I feel sad when I'm not around him and such, and John and Ana have noticed and have complained how I'm not happy when he's not with us, or how when he is, I kind of ignore them. That's how much I love him.

Last friday, Gus was sitting next to me, and on the other side, also next to me, Ana. Gus had my phone and I got a snapchat from another friend who knew about my feelings toward him, that said ""do you still like him?"" (I had a snap on my story and he was on it), I only saw he replied it with a yes, and then he asked me who I like. I obviously changed the subject very fast, and he decided to go through my conversations, at this point I'm freaking out (I had taken the phone away from him before because he would read conversations with John and Ana, and then got mad because we were keeping secrets from him). I just can't stand up and take it cause we're in a school thing, so I'm there begging for my phone and he just keeps smiling thinking it's funny, at one point I did get up but the teacher told me to sit down again, like 10 minutes passed and I guessed he found out he is the one I like, because he got really quiet and wouldn't look at me. Ana says he was staring at her angrily, like angry because he knew she knew and didn't tell him sooner.

As class ended, he gave me my phone and barely said a word to me. Some classmates asked me, joking, what kind of porn I had on my phone that was so important to stand up in the middle of the class, I just laughed and said I like my things private, but then Gus said: ""that's just how OP is, he keeps his feelings to himself"" Ana and I just looked at each other, and I'm thinking everything's fucked now.

I was supposed to drive him home (I always drive Ana and Gus home), but there's this other guy who can also give him a ride home, but Gus' jacket's on my car so he decides to go with us, we're on the parking lot and I ask him if we need to talk, and he says: shut up, I don't ever wanna talk to you again. Imagine how I felt when I heard that, my heart just broke. He decides to just take his jacket and leave with the other guy but he's already leaving so he ends up going with me. We dropped off Ana, and as soon as we're alone I say I'm sorry, sorry for how I feel, and sorry for not telling him before. He is completely silent and won't even look at me. We did talk a bit, mostly me, but I kind of got the point he was more upset about me not telling him, than me loving him. I asked what would happen now, if he was just going to stop talking to me, and he said he was mature enough not to do that, when I dropped him at his house I started crying, I didn't realize he hadn't shut the door so he came back to do it and saw me crying, and he just said: Thanks for everything, OP. Goodbye.

I don't know what to do, he told me if he felt like talking about it we would. I feel so empty without him. I feel like the worst idiot ever, I lost the only friend I've been comfortable enough with like to talk about very private things, I haven't sleep much since, I'm just really sad. 

I'm not really sure why I'm posting this, I just feel the need to tell people about it, since I don't tell people my feelings and just keep it to myself (Just like Gus said) I thought maybe it would be a good idea to post it here.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry if this turns out to be very long, also, english&amp;#39;s not my first language so be patient if I make mistakes, please. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through all this I fell in love hard, and I talked about that with other friends, John and Ana, we all four are very close, we all decided that it&amp;#39;s not a very good idea to tell him how I feel, because even though he is comfortable with my sexual orientation, he may find it awkward being around me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind I&amp;#39;ve always known he&amp;#39;s straight and I know nothing can happen between us, nor I want anything to happen, I appreciate his friendship a lot. But it hurts anyways, knowing that, he&amp;#39;s the first person I&amp;#39;ve liked (loved?) ever and with whom I&amp;#39;d be willing to have a relationship. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past two months it&amp;#39;s only gotten worse, I feel sad when I&amp;#39;m not around him and such, and John and Ana have noticed and have complained how I&amp;#39;m not happy when he&amp;#39;s not with us, or how when he is, I kind of ignore them. That&amp;#39;s how much I love him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last friday, Gus was sitting next to me, and on the other side, also next to me, Ana. Gus had my phone and I got a snapchat from another friend who knew about my feelings toward him, that said &amp;quot;do you still like him?&amp;quot; (I had a snap on my story and he was on it), I only saw he replied it with a yes, and then he asked me who I like. I obviously changed the subject very fast, and he decided to go through my conversations, at this point I&amp;#39;m freaking out (I had taken the phone away from him before because he would read conversations with John and Ana, and then got mad because we were keeping secrets from him). I just can&amp;#39;t stand up and take it cause we&amp;#39;re in a school thing, so I&amp;#39;m there begging for my phone and he just keeps smiling thinking it&amp;#39;s funny, at one point I did get up but the teacher told me to sit down again, like 10 minutes passed and I guessed he found out he is the one I like, because he got really quiet and wouldn&amp;#39;t look at me. Ana says he was staring at her angrily, like angry because he knew she knew and didn&amp;#39;t tell him sooner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As class ended, he gave me my phone and barely said a word to me. Some classmates asked me, joking, what kind of porn I had on my phone that was so important to stand up in the middle of the class, I just laughed and said I like my things private, but then Gus said: &amp;quot;that&amp;#39;s just how OP is, he keeps his feelings to himself&amp;quot; Ana and I just looked at each other, and I&amp;#39;m thinking everything&amp;#39;s fucked now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was supposed to drive him home (I always drive Ana and Gus home), but there&amp;#39;s this other guy who can also give him a ride home, but Gus&amp;#39; jacket&amp;#39;s on my car so he decides to go with us, we&amp;#39;re on the parking lot and I ask him if we need to talk, and he says: shut up, I don&amp;#39;t ever wanna talk to you again. Imagine how I felt when I heard that, my heart just broke. He decides to just take his jacket and leave with the other guy but he&amp;#39;s already leaving so he ends up going with me. We dropped off Ana, and as soon as we&amp;#39;re alone I say I&amp;#39;m sorry, sorry for how I feel, and sorry for not telling him before. He is completely silent and won&amp;#39;t even look at me. We did talk a bit, mostly me, but I kind of got the point he was more upset about me not telling him, than me loving him. I asked what would happen now, if he was just going to stop talking to me, and he said he was mature enough not to do that, when I dropped him at his house I started crying, I didn&amp;#39;t realize he hadn&amp;#39;t shut the door so he came back to do it and saw me crying, and he just said: Thanks for everything, OP. Goodbye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know what to do, he told me if he felt like talking about it we would. I feel so empty without him. I feel like the worst idiot ever, I lost the only friend I&amp;#39;ve been comfortable enough with like to talk about very private things, I haven&amp;#39;t sleep much since, I&amp;#39;m just really sad. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not really sure why I&amp;#39;m posting this, I just feel the need to tell people about it, since I don&amp;#39;t tell people my feelings and just keep it to myself (Just like Gus said) I thought maybe it would be a good idea to post it here.&lt;/p&gt;

Been self harming since i was about 12. Had a long battle with depression/suicide and although i'm feeling much better about life these days i still self harm a fair bit.

I don't do anything severe anymore, haven't needed stitches in over a year and mostly just razor nicks. It's something i want to stop completely, but finding it hard to find alternatives to relieving myself. 

Haven't been with a guy since i was like 18, i'm 23 now. I think a guy would auto think i'm crazy or gross. Trying to turn my life around, but the damage is done. 

Instead of trying to describe, i might as well just show : ( not rly bad but don't click if you don't like blood/cuts w/e) http://i.imgusr.com/cGYYibE.jpg deal breaker? that's what my thighs look like.

Please be honest, no point deluding myself. I'm under the impression as of now like 99% of guys will find it a dealbreaker. The irony is, i think having a boyfriend would make me stop. Right now i get bored and lonely and that's when it happens.

Well that's my attitude before I go out and at the beginning of my bar/club nights. I know that I need to approach people to have any chance of meeting guys. Every time before I go out, I tell myself, ""Tonight is the night you start approaching guys. Just try talking to them."" I feel like a model when I look myself in the mirror. I feel confident.

And then I look around...

*He has scruff and is with a group of scruffy guys - he wouldn't be into a twink. He's making out with a masculine guy, he wouldn't like a slightly feminine guy. He's into muscular guys. He has nice, clear skin, he wouldn't like a guy with large moles all over his skin. He's only into hairy guys. He's only dancing with dark haired guys, he wouldn't be into blondes. He's built, he wouldn't like a less bulky guy. He's hot, he's out of my league. He's tan or has darker skin, he wouldn't like a pale white guy. He has nice pecs, he wouldn't like my smaller, bad insertion points chest. He has abs, and I don't, so there's no point in trying to make eye contact with him. He met my gaze, but looked away instantly - he's not interested. I held eye contact with him, but he didn't come over to talk to me, so he must have just been looking back at me wondering why that unattractive weirdo is staring at him.*

I convince myself that every guy I'm attracted to isn't interested in me, and by the end of the night, I haven't talked to or danced with anyone. At that point, I get really depressed, my mood plummets, and I leave shortly after, going home to cry myself to sleep because ""no one likes me."" This happens every single time. Then I go through the week or few weeks without going out and being depressed, thinking ""no one will like me unless I'm muscular."" It's a good motivator for the gym, but it sucks being sad all of the time. And if what you guys have said in the past is true, I don't *need* to be muscular for people to like me, so it's wrong.

My friends have told me that I don't look inviting when I'm dancing, so I won't ever have someone approach me (and I'm just not that attractive, so people won't forcibly approach me). So, I **need** to do the approaching myself. But I can't bring myself to do it because my mind rejects me for everyone. I've known the ""right answer"" for several months now - that I need to *just talk to people*. And I tell myself this on every occasion, but then when it happens, I come up with excuses and bring myself down. I don't know what to do... please help.

But I've been very confused lately. Again I apologize for wall of text, I needed to let this off my chest. All my life I have considered myself straight and for the most part I've been very comfortable with my sexuality. I've always felt attraction to women. I always love when a girl flirts with me, I learned guitar to get laid, I worked out to get laid lol, I stand tall when girls walk into a room, I have a gf who I love so very much and wanna marry, I get hard around her easily. Dreams are about girls, masturbate thinking of girls, get hard thinking of gf/girls.

On the other hand, I have never been attracted to guys sexually. My friendships with my guy friends have always been purely platonic, like brothers to me. I've never checked out guys in my High school gym locker room in a sexual way. I've never found men's bodies attractive, I never have urges to check out a guy unlike a girl.  In some rare instance maybe I felt attracted to a guy  if he was kinda pretty I was like huh.. even that wore off quickly too. I can say leo DiCaprio is handsome but I was usually busy checking out the blonde girl in wolf of wall street. :-/

But in two instances I have seriously questioned my sexuality. Once when I was 21, first time, I thought to myself huh did I just check out that guys penis... while watching porn. Then I start checking if I'm attracted to guys and to check I watched gay porn. I ended up getting a boner, masturbated and came. The anxiety shot up, I paced around my apartment for a solid week straight, I felt the stress in my hair follicles, but when I google guys I feel nothing. Then later I went back to watching gay porn, and lost all appeal to it, so I was like I think I'm fine, was just messing with myself, went back to being myself for 3 years. The second time the same thing happened I felt huge anxiety and heart jumping around guys, images of guys, but this had been going on 8 months now, developed slowly . Now, I had finally overcome it, and felt pretty normal but I kept pushing myself to think of gay stuff to see if I'm really ""back to normal"", then eventually I again felt some arousal, then I ended up googling gay pictures and felt turned on to masterbate again and came again... The anxiety shoots up. Maybe I'm sexualizing guys and making it taboo, or what I don't know. 

I am just so fucking confused now.  I have always thought you are born straight or gay or BI and I had felt straight through and through, in my bones. This is causing me so much anxiety that it drives me suicidal. But I think of my loved ones, my gf etc. I obviously feel immense fear about this, and also shame when I think of my beautiful girlfriend, I would die for that girl, but I wouldn't want to lead her on or be in a  closet or something. In my defence, I am looking at sexual content so some arousal is supposed to be natural so I read, I also googled H-O.C.D and I ticked off every symptom 100%, and I masterbated to guys asses that kinda looked like girls assets, like very curvy girls asses I guess is as far as I can stretch it. But it's very confusing. Imagining myself experimenting makes the anxiety and stress even worse. They usually start as anxiety and intrusive thoughts like... ""Do you actually enjoy women because you have deep seeded gay tendencies?"" Then my ocd brain take over. It just feels unfair. Or am I ""one of those straight guys who turn gay?"" (hocd symptom.) I dunno I just need insight I guess. I'm very depressed for 8 months.

We're very happy together, and are thinking of moving in with each other.

There is an issue though. My boyfriend is overly paranoid that whenever I'm not with him. Be it I'm just out with friends, or whatever, he assumes I'm cheating.

His last relationship went for 4 years. During that time, his ex would screw around with a girl, and never revealed his relationship with him (like his relationship never existed).

This July, I'm going to Europe for 2 weeks. I kept inviting him to come with me, but he said no. However, he keeps thinking I'm going to cheat on him.

My stance on cheating is crystal clear to him (I find it deplorable and do not stand for it).

Is there anything else I can do other than to just let his paranoia play out? Or is there something else I can do to convince him that I'm loyal to him?

EDIT: While the points raised in the comments are definitely noted and will be considered. I'm not looking to move in any time soon (as noted, we're just sort of toying with the idea)

UPDATE: So I've spoken to my boyfriend about this, and told him I have grave concerns about being in a relationship with someone who doesn't trust me. He realizes that he's painting with broad strokes. He tells me that he's never felt the way he does about me ever, and doesn't want to lose me.

Sorry for only looking on body shape, I can be such a hypocrite and insensitive sometimes, but I really want someone to cuddle with and talk about life. So what you guys think? Am I normal? What should I do? I&amp;#39;m just so confused and lost because people tell me (indirectly) no, but I can just say yes. Also I&amp;#39;m not openly gay, which make it even harder because no one knows about me, and is really hard to &amp;quot;come out&amp;quot; in this type of places because you&amp;#39;ll just be classified as a faggot without actually knowing you. &lt;/p&gt;

So I need some sense shaken into me.

I am recently out of a relationship (2yrs). I'm back on the market, and looking for casual dating/hook ups. To be frank, I want the D. Ideally, I want a fun fling to go along with the D. A guy I can hang out with, drink beers with, and bang on occasion. Problem is, I have no prospects. So I have resorted to Tinder. 

Met a cute guy on there, had a few dates. Was totally upfront with him that I was just looking for casual dating. But, in the end, he freaked out because he ""couldn't see us working long-term"". Kind of left-fielded me, but whatever.. I found another guy. 

So this other guy and I have been texting for a couple weeks. Nothing major, but just flirty shit throughout the day. Our schedules are polar opposite, so there's been a lot of ""come drink with me!"" - ""I can't, work in a few hours!"".. etc etc. I decided that it was probably just not realistic to put much effort into it anymore, because it would be a logistical nightmare. Told him that. I expected the standard reply (Read, Ignore, Disappear), but he shocked me, and basically said ""Don't give up on me. I want to meet you."" 

So, plan is to keep this one open, and see if anything happens.

Problem is, I find myself totally obsessing over this guy (in my head). I don't even know him. I honestly can't explain it. But I don't want to be obsessed. My whole goal is to just have fun for a while, with no strings attached, yet here I am, schoolgirling over this guy. 

Please help me not be a desperate idiot.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;OK. So I need some sense shaken into me.&lt;/p&gt;
