And of all the outlets, this forum is one of the worst.  But I'm here because, despite the flimsy favoritism and mob mentality, there's a sincere few that above all else can connect with my experience!  In words, in text, transcending face to form, my heart-full intent does come through clear as day to a few.  I'm here to just get some stuff off my chest, and if anything strikes you, reader, friend, acquaintance in feeling but comrade in spirit, I am all ears to hear what thoughts appear at our interface.  So as I would hear you out, just hear me out.  I'm no angel, but I don't have to think I'm a good guy, I have many people that rely on me to beg my case.  Then again, I'm not here to prove myself.  I'm here to prostrate my feelings just a little bit.

Now this is the rub.  The abrasive bit that always irks the ire of those vitriolic few.  And to this whole community's discredit, sometimes the loudest, most corrosive wake gains the strongest flank against what was never meant to actually incite aggression behind the comfort of a warmly glowing screen.  And honestly I have seen the most bizarre twists and turns from something even as simple as poetry.  In fact, I think I have seen some of the most ferocious attacks as a result of reading love poems.  Isn't that curious?  Must have been a good one.

But I digress.  I'm here because I hurt, and I'm here because obviously I link my hurt to my sexuality, so let me deliver the data piece-meal.  Firstly, I don't much 'love' myself enough to make myself into the vision of the man I want or could be.  For my entire life growing up I didn't want to be popular (but I was), I didn't want first place (but I did), and I didn't want to win awards (but I did).  What I wanted was to love myself.  That day never came for me as a kid, and disastrously overspilled into my young adult life.  OK, so I am still a young adult, but many others of my strata are so much more well equipped to deal with the terms of this life than I.  My successes had a two-fold irony.  My parents became drunk on their ability to allow themselves to put me on a very long leader-line: they wanted everything to not have to deal with me and my gayness.  They are not bad people, but they did fully know they had a chance to stand on the right side of history and they have nothing but shame and embarrassing distress over their past dealings with my gayness.  I take it on the arches, what's done is done and they just didn't do what they needed to.  They enjoyed all of the fabulous stories they allowed themselves to tell as I nursed my damaged psyche through another day, and I was very damaged very early.  Of course, it was my own choice to hurt myself, but it was all I knew to do to deal with my feelings.  

So let me break the poor-me of the past and give perspective with the present.  Now, I do want to win, I want a body and mind, I want to charm and amaze.  But these ambitions are just wishes massaged beneath a thick blanket of egoistic scorn.  Am I a cynic?  I certainly am not a contrarian, and am a careful adherent to the scientific method in all things, but I am no optimist.  And I am so scared that these admirable traits about me had long ago subsided and I was running on fumes.  I am just stuck.  I had been stuck for a very long time, a hyper-emotional man-child trapped in an eighteen year old's body when I first went out to fail out of college.  I literally had no idea how to operate in the world.  I was kind and endearing and had plenty of friends, easily liked, but my gay-shy-shame persona always crept in to sicken my hopes with trepidations and tormenting doubt.  I hated who I was, because it would be years still before I admitted who I was.  I dated lots of girls, and had sex with very few.  It was really scary and sad, I knew I was lying somehow, but was becoming psychotic in my attempts to stifle it.  

But the present!  So Im out, and my parents are trying to be ok with it.  I probably will never know what its like to actually have my parents accept me in their heart.  Im no idiot, I can see past the words, and place their language and contexts into their connotative syntax: they disapprove of my ""lifestyle"".  Just as I have always said that the word ""lifestyle"" is taboo to me, and they should never use it in conversation if they desire my respect, they continue to do so, and probably always will.  But this isnt about my parents, that exposition is very thin and I feel a bit required for admitting my shortcomings.  There are so many reasons for my decisions.  Is that a fault as well, should I act on the heart more and pull apart the reality less?  I do often feel sub-human.  

I look around a room and see not a reflection of me.  I hear them talking, my friends and peers and colleagues and I dont recognize my voice.  I can shake another's hand or embrace in a hug but the result returned is an icy dullness.  I just don't believe them, in my heart.  What do I do?  I have a job, but not enough of one, I should be schlepping it full time somewhere.  But my part time gig is so rewarding, and of my various various many jobs (all of which I have performed admirably and come highly recommended for accomplishing), this one job I have never worked harder to do.  My bosses tell the whole establishment that I am the most impressive hire they have, and I work in maintenance.  I just want to make the place beautiful.  I want everyone to be happy.  I want to make the pool sparkling and the trees flourishing and the carpets supple and the rooms sharp.  And the residents love me, but I wonder if it was the deeds first or just my looks.  And as an aside, would they still love me if I admitted I was gay (so many of them want to hook me up with their daughters.  ""Are you married?""  ""Would you like to be?""  ""You would make a beautiful child"").  I dont work for the compliments, I work because I want to make my existence as fruitful as possible in the opportunities I am trusted to perform.  I learned this lesson while dabbling in art school.  

But I am no artist.  I have no passion.  I am no writer, my story is weak, underdeveloped, and lacks demonstrative conflict!  Im ineffective, Im formless, Im a passing fancy.  I cant go to gay bars because the last 5 guys I met only wanted to have me as a notch in their belt.  They picked me from across the room and once I made the slightest motion in their direction they had to claim me as a trophy.  And here I sit on the shelf to gather dust.  I wanted a friend, where only I was made to wreck a home.  I just want to enjoy myself, I want to enjoy the company of myself.  But I dont.

I remember when I came out I watched the movie ""Shelter"" and I was in tears the whole time, overwhelmed by how cute it was to identify with that kid's feelings, letting them flow from me freely for the first time.  And then I was overcome with jealous rage!  I couldnt believe I was cheated the life he had, I thought I should have been courageous enough to have been myself as a kid.  I wished just one person would have come along and told me, its OK dude, youre cool just as the way you are and thats awesome youre gay!  I was just on the other side of the cusp of this acceptance thats sweeping the world over.  I guess I can come to terms with this, who has time for regrets like that?  That I could just have never had to suffer at all where instead I did so much.  I did so much suffering I developed a raging addiction to heroin, and that was the first time I was ever in love.  The man I did it with turned out to be betraying me very deeply.  I cannot speak to this, we all have our own reasons.  I thought he loved me, instead he played me as the ultimate fool.  The dumbest dumb person.  

Well I still do heroin but I keep it to a point where I am not addicted.  It is still offputting, and having used it all through high school to subdue my sexuality (since day one of 9th grade), I had no idea that the vast vast majority of the world actually be totally abhorred to the thought that I was using drugs.  I just thought everyone did!  I have that under control, but it still hurts in retrospect each time.  That I get so much happiness, passion, urge, joy, desire to just be alive after I snort that shit.  Its like the days before go silent and suddenly I am alive for a mere few hours, before the beating of my heart goes silent again.  My world is very quiet now.  No yelling or cheering or laughing or crying.  I just sort of move through the days as one might swim through the tides.  Gracefully, delicately, but the problem is that subtlety tends to keep one from getting noticed.  So I dress funny and act cute, but that doesnt really get the me that I want to be out on the table.  The vision of myself so grand in feeling is only ever farther away in my mind.  I havent had sex in over a year, because I just havent wanted to.  And I think that is awful, when I first came out I was obsessed with feeling another man.  I just wanted to be in contact with the male form all the time.  Then I got to know how to expect to be treated, and I was dealt a few bad hands and now Im pissing and moaning myself into a very shallow grave.

One of my less open minded friends said to me that its like im not even gay cause i never seem like im gay and never am with another guy.  I thought that was very sad, that I suck at being who I am so bad that I dont even seem like a real person.  And when I want to get it out I just find myself feeling very silly.  Who cares?  So I chart my inventory of exes and I reply to the stockpiles of flirts and posts.  Everyone I have dated has fallen in love with me and I had not returned the same feelings for them.  I just hate myself for not feeling the love they do.  When will I feel at home with another?  Then again, I havent seriously ever considered another guy to be the love of my life, because we met under such frivolous circumstances.  A4A, grindr, fucking cocks and meat swinging around.  And these are my brothers, they that share the same parts of my soul.  I do feel cheated, if only I was just asexual and was in love with the almighty dollar.  Maybe then my life would mean something.  Im scared that one day, in a few years should I remain in a personal, emotional, physical drought of reciprocation of my earnest effect, I will just be totally lost.  I already feel thin and greyed, my sweet charming self spoiled, left out to rot.  

I didnt use to be so negative.  Now thats all I am.  And I hate to think that all it would take to save my life is a hand, extended through the black and poisonous fog of my view of the world and fold their fingers through mine and tell me ""its ok, I like you because you are who you are.  And I want to be with you.""  I dont have sex because it made them wild for me, treat me terribly when I didnt supply it.  Now I cant even jerk off, I feel tired, I look at my favorite categories and fetishes and just think ""ew"".  And I think that is also very sad.  

Of course, I dont feel so bad about anything when I take heroin.  Ive been clean, for very long stretches of time.  But I keep coming back because I keep failing to find myself or for a reason to live.  I think working out would be selfish, masturbatory.  I think continuing my studies would be fruitless, I already know more than what I can put to use practically.  I just dont want more without a hand to pull me up to get me started.  And now sets in the paradox, that I no longer am turned to wait for the arrival of such a hand.  Im just perfectly content to stare into my black corner and count seconds and minutes in my head until I trail off and fall asleep.  

Im terribly under achieving.  But you might not think so in my tiny windows of interactions and relationships, I do so much to bend over backwards to amaze people, but it sort of comes naturally, and I love to bring a smile to anyones face.  Ive never felt mean a day in my life, should I?  I only remember people being mean to me in my early childhood, and so I vowed to spread love.  I wouldnt be a pathetic faggot like they all said, they would come to thank me for my contributions.  But now I am not contributing to myself. 

Anyone care to guess what kind of endgame I can expect or try to put myself into?  How do I play the game anymore, what might get me interested in living again?  Im very serious, I think after I bring enough smiles to the people around me, theres some imaginary threshold that will be satisfied and I wont feel so guilty about releasing myself from this mortal coil.  Its very easy to do with heroin.  

I want to create but I doubt myself very quickly.  Maybe my art will acquire value?  I have given alot of it away, I just like the idea of it hanging in so many people's houses.  That they came into my home and were dazzled by my creation and had an emotional connection to it.  Like a bird watcher, I wait and note and savor the moment, and then I give it to them.  They earned it.  I just dont know what ive earned.  I cant make sense of being gay.  I do and I dont feel like so many of you based on what you guys may write.  I will never care about pop culture but I cant bring myself to pay attention to sports.  I dont know, small example, minute trivias, but is it part of a larger pattern?  How do I love myself for being gay when my experience in the gay world is written in the words of distress and anguish?  My dreams are written int he language of regret, trapped icons behind glass to amuse my thinning imagination as my vision of the future narrows to a tunnel.

Just as I have always said that the word &amp;quot;lifestyle&amp;quot; is taboo to me, and they should never use it in conversation if they desire my respect, they continue to do so, and probably always will.  But this isnt about my parents, that exposition is very thin and I feel a bit required for admitting my shortcomings.  There are so many reasons for my decisions.  Is that a fault as well, should I act on the heart more and pull apart the reality less?  I do often feel sub-human.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look around a room and see not a reflection of me.  I hear them talking, my friends and peers and colleagues and I dont recognize my voice.  I can shake another&amp;#39;s hand or embrace in a hug but the result returned is an icy dullness.  I just don&amp;#39;t believe them, in my heart.  What do I do?  I have a job, but not enough of one, I should be schlepping it full time somewhere.  But my part time gig is so rewarding, and of my various various many jobs (all of which I have performed admirably and come highly recommended for accomplishing), this one job I have never worked harder to do.  My bosses tell the whole establishment that I am the most impressive hire they have, and I work in maintenance.  I just want to make the place beautiful.  I want everyone to be happy.  I want to make the pool sparkling and the trees flourishing and the carpets supple and the rooms sharp.  And the residents love me, but I wonder if it was the deeds first or just my looks.  And as an aside, would they still love me if I admitted I was gay (so many of them want to hook me up with their daughters.  &amp;quot;Are you married?&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;Would you like to be?&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;You would make a beautiful child&amp;quot;).  I dont work for the compliments, I work because I want to make my existence as fruitful as possible in the opportunities I am trusted to perform.  I learned this lesson while dabbling in art school.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I am no artist.  I have no passion.  I am no writer, my story is weak, underdeveloped, and lacks demonstrative conflict!  Im ineffective, Im formless, Im a passing fancy.  I cant go to gay bars because the last 5 guys I met only wanted to have me as a notch in their belt.  They picked me from across the room and once I made the slightest motion in their direction they had to claim me as a trophy.  And here I sit on the shelf to gather dust.  I wanted a friend, where only I was made to wreck a home.  I just want to enjoy myself, I want to enjoy the company of myself.  But I dont.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember when I came out I watched the movie &amp;quot;Shelter&amp;quot; and I was in tears the whole time, overwhelmed by how cute it was to identify with that kid&amp;#39;s feelings, letting them flow from me freely for the first time.  And then I was overcome with jealous rage!  I couldnt believe I was cheated the life he had, I thought I should have been courageous enough to have been myself as a kid.  I wished just one person would have come along and told me, its OK dude, youre cool just as the way you are and thats awesome youre gay!  I was just on the other side of the cusp of this acceptance thats sweeping the world over.  I guess I can come to terms with this, who has time for regrets like that?  That I could just have never had to suffer at all where instead I did so much.  I did so much suffering I developed a raging addiction to heroin, and that was the first time I was ever in love.  The man I did it with turned out to be betraying me very deeply.  I cannot speak to this, we all have our own reasons.  I thought he loved me, instead he played me as the ultimate fool.  The dumbest dumb person.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well I still do heroin but I keep it to a point where I am not addicted.  It is still offputting, and having used it all through high school to subdue my sexuality (since day one of 9th grade), I had no idea that the vast vast majority of the world actually be totally abhorred to the thought that I was using drugs.  I just thought everyone did!  I have that under control, but it still hurts in retrospect each time.  That I get so much happiness, passion, urge, joy, desire to just be alive after I snort that shit.  Its like the days before go silent and suddenly I am alive for a mere few hours, before the beating of my heart goes silent again.  My world is very quiet now.  No yelling or cheering or laughing or crying.  I just sort of move through the days as one might swim through the tides.  Gracefully, delicately, but the problem is that subtlety tends to keep one from getting noticed.  So I dress funny and act cute, but that doesnt really get the me that I want to be out on the table.  The vision of myself so grand in feeling is only ever farther away in my mind.  I havent had sex in over a year, because I just havent wanted to.  And I think that is awful, when I first came out I was obsessed with feeling another man.  I just wanted to be in contact with the male form all the time.  Then I got to know how to expect to be treated, and I was dealt a few bad hands and now Im pissing and moaning myself into a very shallow grave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my less open minded friends said to me that its like im not even gay cause i never seem like im gay and never am with another guy.  I thought that was very sad, that I suck at being who I am so bad that I dont even seem like a real person.  And when I want to get it out I just find myself feeling very silly.  Who cares?  So I chart my inventory of exes and I reply to the stockpiles of flirts and posts.  Everyone I have dated has fallen in love with me and I had not returned the same feelings for them.  I just hate myself for not feeling the love they do.  When will I feel at home with another?  Then again, I havent seriously ever considered another guy to be the love of my life, because we met under such frivolous circumstances.  A4A, grindr, fucking cocks and meat swinging around.  And these are my brothers, they that share the same parts of my soul.  I do feel cheated, if only I was just asexual and was in love with the almighty dollar.  Maybe then my life would mean something.  Im scared that one day, in a few years should I remain in a personal, emotional, physical drought of reciprocation of my earnest effect, I will just be totally lost.  I already feel thin and greyed, my sweet charming self spoiled, left out to rot.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didnt use to be so negative.  Now thats all I am.  And I hate to think that all it would take to save my life is a hand, extended through the black and poisonous fog of my view of the world and fold their fingers through mine and tell me &amp;quot;its ok, I like you because you are who you are.  And I want to be with you.&amp;quot;  I dont have sex because it made them wild for me, treat me terribly when I didnt supply it.  Now I cant even jerk off, I feel tired, I look at my favorite categories and fetishes and just think &amp;quot;ew&amp;quot;.  And I think that is also very sad.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I dont feel so bad about anything when I take heroin.  Ive been clean, for very long stretches of time.  But I keep coming back because I keep failing to find myself or for a reason to live.  I think working out would be selfish, masturbatory.  I think continuing my studies would be fruitless, I already know more than what I can put to use practically.  I just dont want more without a hand to pull me up to get me started.  And now sets in the paradox, that I no longer am turned to wait for the arrival of such a hand.  Im just perfectly content to stare into my black corner and count seconds and minutes in my head until I trail off and fall asleep.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Im terribly under achieving.  But you might not think so in my tiny windows of interactions and relationships, I do so much to bend over backwards to amaze people, but it sort of comes naturally, and I love to bring a smile to anyones face.  Ive never felt mean a day in my life, should I?  I only remember people being mean to me in my early childhood, and so I vowed to spread love.  I wouldnt be a pathetic faggot like they all said, they would come to thank me for my contributions.  But now I am not contributing to myself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone care to guess what kind of endgame I can expect or try to put myself into?  How do I play the game anymore, what might get me interested in living again?  Im very serious, I think after I bring enough smiles to the people around me, theres some imaginary threshold that will be satisfied and I wont feel so guilty about releasing myself from this mortal coil.  Its very easy to do with heroin.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to create but I doubt myself very quickly.  Maybe my art will acquire value?  I have given alot of it away, I just like the idea of it hanging in so many people&amp;#39;s houses.  That they came into my home and were dazzled by my creation and had an emotional connection to it.  Like a bird watcher, I wait and note and savor the moment, and then I give it to them.  They earned it.  I just dont know what ive earned.  I cant make sense of being gay.  I do and I dont feel like so many of you based on what you guys may write.  I will never care about pop culture but I cant bring myself to pay attention to sports.  I dont know, small example, minute trivias, but is it part of a larger pattern?  How do I love myself for being gay when my experience in the gay world is written in the words of distress and anguish?  My dreams are written int he language of regret, trapped icons behind glass to amuse my thinning imagination as my vision of the future narrows to a tunnel.  &lt;/p&gt;

I'm an out 18 year old guy, and left school last year. My boyfriend is in the closet, none of his friends know, and he and his friends are very 'jockish' (for want of a better word). We never talk about the fact he's gay, nor do we ever talk about emotional attachment. 

Whenever my friends and I go out, we invariably run into him and his friends. And when this happens, he NEVER talks to me. He'll glance at me a couple times, but no more, even if his friends come over to talk to us. We aren't in school any more- cliques no longer exist. 

As one of my friends pointed out, in friendship groups like his, everyone is insecure, and to expose vulnerability is to condemn oneself to alienation. And in that respect, I totally empathise. He's probably worried if he talks to me, people will put two and two together. I get that.

But it hurts so much. To see someone you love act as if you don't even exist.

Saying things like his life choices are disgusting, calling him flaming a gay, and told him to stop acting like a fag. They were never like this when  he was living in Colorado, atleast not to my knowledge.  I am worried that during his time away his parents are going to get more and more verbally abusive and there isnt mmuch i can do to help and that kills me. Just recently they found my old wallet left in his car and found out my real age. I recently turned 21 and he will be 18 on the first of next month. another thing that freaks me out is that they essentially believe i was molesting their son. Am I being too paranoid in thinking that they might try and take some legal action against me because they dont approve of him being gay especially him dating someone 3 1/2 years older than him? I know age of consent is 17 but still....&lt;/p&gt;

I have major updates on basically all my threads I made do far. A lot of shit has basically come down last month. Hopefully you stick to the whole thread, I know it's fairly long but you'll help a lost soul.

First and foremost, I came out to my older sister (the one who instigated that I had a boyfriend to my mom). I wouldn't say it went well but it could have gone worse. So when I told her I thought was gay, she basically seemed to go into a denial mode. She said there was no way and that I didn't show any signs etc. This gave me cognitive dissonance because I always have seen myself as a little more feminine than my male peers in certain areas. But that wasn't the end of it.

She then asked me how could I even know if I never been with anyone before. She suggested that I should experiment before I label myself, which is true for the most part but I think she said it because she doesn't want me to be gay (more on this shortly). I am open to experimenting with girls but I really don't think it's my thing. 9/10 times I am attracted to a guy rather than a girl, all my current sexual fantasies are with men.

She then said she would support me no matter what since I am her brother but that she would prefer that I wasn't gay. She then told me that she did not want me to tell my parents because it would devastate them. Isn't that nice.

The second thing that happened to me was when I went to my cousin's house for a bbq with the family. The family started taking about my accomplishments and about my job. One thing went to another and they started giving me advice about dating in the workplace. Then they said that hopefully someday I find a blond bombshell as a girlfriend (a joke I guess). I then turn to my cousin ( to who I am out to) and say ""aww great now I have a bombshell requirement as well."" Then they started talking about my childhood friends and their current situations, and this is when the conversation went sour.

My dad starts talking about this one friend who came out to his parents recently and possibly has his boyfriend living with his family. My dad said that it was ridiculous that his parents could allow that etc. Then they started taking about whether we are born this way or not. Then came the bible. My said that it says we are damned, to which my aunt disagreed, and then countered adamantly that he would look it up for her. My aunt then said that regardless she would still love her child no matter what. Then my dad agreed but then said that he would allow gross acts (I.e. sex) in his house and that his son would have to get his own place elsewhere to do as he pleases with his boyfriend. My brother in law was such a gentleman and said that it wouldn't change anything and that he would still love a gay relative for the the person they are.

I stayed quiet the whole time listening and eating my bbq. I literally wanted to die at that moment and couldn't believe this conversation was actually happening. My cousin then asked me how I felt about the whole ordeal. Due to being a sarcastic asshole at times I said ""Yep, this is definitely taking me one step closer to suicide"". We then went outside and I almost cried. My cousin said I should let it out but I refused to let my family hurt me with their words. I took a few deep breaths and I got over it. My cousin was shocked easily I can suppress my feelings to which I responded ""this is how I survived all this time, I've been conditioned for years"". Then life went back to my routine.

Please give me your thoughts bros, I need to hear another perspective on this and how to deal with it so it doesn't get to me.

**tl;dr:**I came out to my older sister and she is basically in denial about it. Went to my cousin's house, and a slightly homophobic conversation ensued. I was negatively affected by it but I suppressed my feelings in front of my cousin. I wanna hear your opinions or advice on the subject and how to deal with it.

So I'm 18 and dont have much experience with anal sex. I find the idea of getting fucked very attractive but when the time comes to do it, I just cant relax and enjoy it. I really enjoy stimulation outside of the anus though, I even enjoy getting one or two fingers up there and just leaving them, but every time I try to mimic the in and out movement of sex my anus instinctively clenches and I have minimal control over it. This in turn feels quite unpleasant. 
Do you guys have any advice? I've thought of getting a butt plug to help loosen me up, but I cant help but think my problem is not due to tightness, but inability to relax. Would a butt plug help?
