I knew I was attracted to boys at a very young age, but I found girls ""pretty"" and just kinda assumed I was attracted to them too. So, I identified as bi. In my teens I dated and slept with girls. I realized that I was capable of mechanically having sex with them, but I couldn't have a deep connection with them. I wasn't attracted to them in a total way. Men on the other hand were intoxicatingly wonderful. So in my late teens early 20s I identified as gay. But as I tried to explore my feelings and sexuality I met all the wrong people. I saw a side of the gay community that didn't reflect who I am or what I want from life. I saw drugs, promiscuity, and that's fine for other people, I'm not judging, but its not me. So, I was lonely and I met a girl. I wasn't attracted to her, but she was funny, smart, kind, and really liked me, which was very appealing after being alone. So, I decided I must have been right when I though I was bi. I thought I could separate my sexual and emotional desires from my rational mind and that I could totally deal with not being with guys. Now here's where it gets totally out of hand: we got married. It was fine at first, but it went into a tailspin, becoming worse and more suffocating year after year. We remained together for 7 years, but we stopped acting like a couple after about 5 years, I gave up and retreated into booze and personal projects. Finally, about a month ago, I found out she was cheating on me. Poor thing wanted a real straight man and I can't blame her. Well, that forced me to deal with all this. She moved out, we started the divorce process, and I started going over my whole life in my head. Then all this stuff started to come up and I realized that its true: I'm gay. Now, here's where it gets out of hand again. I decided to go out one night and celebrate my new found, if not completely confusing, freedom. And my first night out I met a guy. Not some ""Ive been repressed for almost a decade and I'll fuck the first thing I see"" guy, but someone I have a real connection with. My exact type, brilliant, funny, sweet, kind, with deeply held values and interests that are totally in tune with mine. I didn't know I could ever be this attracted to someone in a total way. But, now the questions and requests for advice:

- Is my story common or normal anymore? I see guys knowing their status early, coming out in high school, gay people on TV and CEOs. Part of what kept me from accepting was this nagging fear that I'd seem like a complete freak to other people with my story. It seemed like everyone else knew and was certain early on, and I took this awful meandering path.

- Related to that question, will I scare this guy off if I tell him this. He's a bit younger than me, in his mid 20s, and I'm pretty sure he's been out and sure his whole life. Should I wait until we're sure we really have a thing together, or should I tell him all this horror early and give him a chance to leave early before anyone gets too hurt?

- How do I deal with my friends and family acting like I'm some confused flake and this is ""just another phase?"" See, I was never very good at being closeted. Get a few drinks in me and, well, the gay it strong with this one. People knew my sexuality was confusing, and Id changed how I identified multiple times in my life. Well, I'm finally sure now, but I'm afraid I wont be taken seriously. I guess it doesnt matter, but it kinda does.

Thanks in advance. Its cathartic just to put it all out there.

EDIT: For clarification, I'm not asking if I should tell this guy how I'm starting to feel about him. We're taking things slow and having fun. I just wondered whether my history and story would send someone running, you know?

So it only took 4 months from when I resolved to do it, but I finally did it (along with telling a few other people along the way) This may be a long one, but if it helps push someone over the edge where I was, so be it.

TL;DR: Told my 4 best friends separately, and my mom, all went awesome. And I love my generation where I can tell my closest friends the things I was most afraid to tell them, and then afterwards feel so stupid for ever being afraid to tell them.

After everything fell through with my plans to tell my friend those 4 months ago, I lost my determination to tell him and just moved on and waited for the mood to strike again. At the beginning of October, I gathered to the confidence again to tell a different friend, this time my ex-girlfriend from high school who has long since come out as a lesbian, but for me will always be the one who got away. After I messaged her, she told me that she had recently moved two hours away for her new job, but promised to make plans the next time that she would be in town, once again taking the wind out of my sails. Then a couple weeks later I ran into her in the mall that I worked in, and amongst quickly catching up, decided just to throw it out there to get it out of the way and to have finally told someone. She reacted how I knew she would, ecstatic, extremely surprised, and actually pretty proud of me. We had a great discussion and I was happy even having told one person. 

Next, I told my mom. She had started to ask too many questions about where I was every weekend, I didn't want to keep the lies up, and I didn't want my sister to have to maintain my bullshit any longer. Mom was okay with it but doesn't think I should tell my brother or father about it because she doesn't think they will be okay with it, whatever. She's been good, but will not mention it even if we are alone, or if she does she can not bring herself to actually say that I have a boyfriend, or that I am bi. But I'm okay with all of this for now, at least I don't have to lie to her about where I spend my weekends, and she doesn't have to think I'm a raging alcoholic crashing on peoples couches all weekend. 

Now for the part relevant to my last post:

This past Thursday, my friend from the aforementioned (I'll call him James) post and I went over to our friend (Aka Kyle) from high school's house to hot tub like we always used to, but hadn't been able to for the last 8+ months. The night went as they always do, just catching up on our lives of late over a couple beer. Then when my friend James started teasing Kyle about the girls in his life (or lack thereof), Kyle surprised us both and out of nowhere told us he was gay. Well that took me and James by surprise, I stayed quiet (grinning to my self a little at the situation) while James tried to see if Kyle was bullshitting us. Once I were sure he wasn't, I gave Kyle a chance to fully explain to James and have his moment to come out. Once he was done, I decided to pile on and let them both know that I wasn't as straight as they thought either and the fact that I've been dating a guy for the past 10 months and how happy I was. 

James took a couple minutes to absorb all that, (two of his closest friends came out to him, in a hot tub no less) and then started asking the usual funny personal questions but overall it was awesome and he assured us that nothing at all was any different and he was happy for us. 

I don't know if I would have taken that leap without Kyle breaking that barrier first, but my god I'm thankful I did. We later congratulated each other, And I think my coming out made his a lot less stressful because he immediately knew he had an ally (It sure helped me). James was awesome about it and it made no difference to our friendship. When he drove me home that night, it was just as usual and we made plans to play xbox the following night like nothing had changed (that was the part that made me the happiest) 

Now tonight I went out for supper with my longest female friend (I've known her since I was 5) who actually once dated James, and decided on a whim to tell her too, it went awesome as well. Her and James had noticed a change in my behaviour (I was distancing myself a bit to avoid telling them about my boyfriend) and assumed I was battling depression or something. They were both relieved that not only was I not depressed at all, but once I told them, I was the happiest I've ever been. 

Moral of the Story: I always scoffed at all the guys on here and elsewhere that insisted that you NEED to come out, but holy shit does it take a load off to tell the people closest to you. Not just not needing to lie, but just knowing that people now know the secret you were so afraid of, yet still love you all the same, has got to be the best feeling in the world.

I'm gay and finally accepting of myself. I'm much more confident, and I've told multiple friends. 

I want to tell my parents. I've tested the waters with them and I'm expecting them to not accept me at first, but I believe they will come around. Also, I don't think it will be devastating, they are not gonna cut me off financially (I'm 22 about to finish my bachelors), it will probably just take some time for them to come around. 

I want to be prepared for their questions, acquisitions, and concerns for my safety. Things like, ""you're gonna get aids"" , ""this is our fault"", "" I should have taken you to church more"" , ""its a sin"".

I'm sure that's not everything, but you all get the idea. Is there a good resource for all of this? Can you help me think of more questions or things to be prepared for? I want to respond with good arguments and facts.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys,&lt;/p&gt;

Before he left, we agreed that open relationships weren't something he wanted. We're both in our 20s, it's the first relationship we both see real potential in, we wanted to do it ""right."" As a couple we had been having sex four or five times a week; obviously, since the deployment it's down nothing.

Fast forward, we've now been separated longer than we were dating. This past weekend, I was within a hairsbreadth of cheating on my boyfriend. My excuses: I didn't plan to do it, there was a lot of alcohol involved, and I sent the stranger on his way before it came down to full-on sex. I flirted with said stranger at the bar, we swapped stories, proceeded to drink. I can see how I led him on and enjoyed it. The guy drove me home from the bar, because I was wasted, it was below freezing out, and he was a nice guy. Once we got there, we made out in his car. Sexual kissing was the line my boyfriend asked me not to cross, even though at the time I thought that was silly... at that point I felt horribly guilty. Eventually I convinced the guy to leave, made it to bed, and passed out.

I told my boyfriend the next morning. The two of us talked and he decided to work through it. I've been depressed despite that. After talking about it at length with my boyfriend I'm wary of bringing it up again to sort through my feelings. I feel like I'm supposed to just be grateful and deal with them on my own.

What worries me is that whenever people talk about being on the other side of cheating they'll will say once a cheater, always a cheater. I've never been this close to either situation before so I guess I'm worried how much truth there is to that.

I made my first gay friends this past year, which was pretty cool. Two of them messaged me the past couple days to hang out. One of them wanted to get wasted at 10:30pm on a weekday and play Smash, which normally could seem fun but now I'm worried it seems like a booty call. The other just broke up with his boyfriend and wants to hang. But now I'm worried he is looking for a rebound. He's the guy who'll ask you've broken up with your man as a greeting - usually that's funny, but now not so much. Considering it, if I did want to fuck around with them they'd say yes. That's never been an issue, because I hadn't consider it, but now I don't I trust myself. Cheating is apparently something I'm capable of and that knowledge alone is distorting, terrible feeling. I thought it was something that happened to other people.

In the beginning, everything was great. It was just like the beginning of every great relationship: cute texts, notes, awesome, deep conversations about what we want and how we were feeling, and amazing sex. We got extremely close really fast. I had recently gotten out of a four year relationship with a woman about three weeks before I met him, and he had been ""single"" since about February when his last boyfriend broke up with him. After his last boyfriend broke up with him, he found out he might have been cheating (this is important later on). 

Around two or three weeks ago, the sex stopped. Like dead in the water ""I'm tired"" ""I'm stressed from work"" ""Can we just go to bed?"" stopped. I was extremely hurt and frustrated because I felt like it was me, was I smothering him or something, and tried talking to him about it because I was finally happy with someone I had always dreamed about and I didn't want to lose him. I flat out asked him what was the problem because just brushing around the subject wasn't getting anywhere. He said he had been watching porn instead, and that he just didn't feel like it anymore. I come to find out that his ex had texted him about a week earlier saying that he saw he was in a new relationship and just wanted to check up, and that brought all the feelings up about his insecurities and why he cheated, etc., so he was putting distance between us because he didn't want to get hurt again. And I understood that. I was hurt that he didn't just talk to me about it, but I get the need to ""do things on your own."" He ended up blocking his number, unfriending him on FB, etc. so he didn't have to deal with him and said he would tell me when if there was a problem again or if anything else came up. 

We made up and had amazing sex after an 11 day hiatus. (Our sex was constant every night since our second date, so this was really hard on me because I felt like he didn't want me anymore.) We were really close the following days, and then his ex texted him again off his current boyfriends phone. I had went to visit my family for Thanksgiving and we were only communicating thru text for a few days while he stayed at home. I found out 5 days after he had texted him by looking at his phone when another text came in and asking about it. He apologized and said he didn't want me to worry or get upset so that's why he didn't tell me. 

And the distance continues. He extremely disconnected and moody and doesn't want sex. I told him I would be there for him while he works out his insecurities and stuff but it getting harder and harder everyday. I feel like I'm alone in the relationship sometimes and I feel myself getting distant as well because I'm pulling away so if we do break things off, it won't hurt as bad. He told me he's trying to get out of this funk and just wants to be happy again, and I believe him and I think he's being sincere. 

We tried sex the other night and it didn't go well. He couldn't get it up and said he felt like everything was forced and pressured. We laid there silent for a few minutes and I asked him if he felt anything in our relationship anymore. He said that he just felt numb. I asked him if he still had feelings for his ex, and he said sort of, but those feelings were of anger and sadness. 

I don't know what to do. Do I break things off and try to find someone who is going to focus 100% on me and give me everything that I need? Or do I wait it out, be there for him, and see if things improve? I would hate to leave him because it would crush him (he feels like everything in his life always ends because of himself--insecurities again) but I don't know how much longer I can sit here thinking about everything and feeling alone in such a new relationship.




TL;DR: Partner in a new relationship is distant and disconnected physically and emotionally but I can see he still wants this and cares about me. What do I do/how do I handle this? Should I be patient for a few days and give him some space so he can handle his ex and his insecurities?
