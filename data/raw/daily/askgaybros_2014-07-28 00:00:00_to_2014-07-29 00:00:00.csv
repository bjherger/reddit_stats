Hey everyone! Currently, I'm living in a place where there are not a lot of guys that I could see myself being with simply because the community here is pretty small and I'm planning on moving sometime when I'm done school.

My question is: how would you feel about talking to someone who's far away geographically but has the potential to move closer? Like there's a place I want to move to when I'm done school and I've explored the profiles of guys from said place and I'd love to talk to some of them and when I go visit, ask them on a date or something. 

Also, for those in long-distance relationships, would you do it with someone you met online? I know some of my friends have LDR but they started dating when they lived in the same place and then moved.

Small dilemma I could do with a little advice on.

To cut a lot of the needless detail out, met a guy on Grindr, really clicked, cute intelligent etc etc and actually lives close to me  (15km is close in rural Ireland). Anyhow, four months of contact, every single day, him initiating every time an wanting snapchat as the means, we agreed to go on a date. Compliments, affectionate tone at times, think I'm onto a winner. Sounds good.

The bullshit; never met for starters (closet case he is, afraid he'd be found out and he works in Dublin on weekdays as a teacher so he can be fired for being gay here). He went travelling for for two weeks, now he's ready to meet up. Four days later, he starts hesitating, I confront it, and he apologised saying he can't face commitment right now and he's sorry he feels that way but would love my friendship. He states his fear of not having an iota of gay life experienced and all things gay petrify him.

So now; it's like the whole ""date""? Theorising never happened, like we've just been great friends forever. He super friendly and chatty like my best friend. Frankly I'm a little confused.

1. I started to feel for him I'll admit as na√Øve? as that was, but I'm a little hurt by him altering our dynamic as I feel he led me on. Is that fair to say? do I have a right to be a little hurt?

2. I shouldn't try and restore that potential of taking him out in a romantic context should I?

3. I have offered to help him out by getting him used to the gay world, like bringing him to a gay bar, let him meet my gay friends, be an ear for his troubles, but when I bring up that and emotional stuff, he straight up blanks it. I just want to be a good friend at minimum but he isn't letting me, what can or should I do?

I guess I'm a bit younger than most people here (15) but I need to know if I should come out. 

As far as my family goes, they're accepting enough of homosexuality- at least from what I can tell. While my grandparents are religious people, I've never heard them comment on the current gay rights movement, or just gay people in general. I have a feeling they might not mind TOO much, but I've never heard them say anything on the subject.

Now, the problem is everybody else. I live in the middle of nowhere in Virginia, and the medium sized town I go to school in is a very redneckish area- there's a church every couple of blocks and the people there don't seem very accepting. The people I feel safest around are most of the people in band- I'm good friends with most of them and they seem like open-minded people all around.

I feel like I can't really wait very long to come out- not being able to be who I am has made me feel kinda empty and depressed, and I don't feel any motivation to go anywhere or do anything, and I'm worried that it will only get worse from here.

I'd *like* to say that I wouldn't care about what other people would say, but... I really would. I'm already self conscious enough, and it already infuriates me seeing bigotry directed towards others- I couldn't imagine hearing them directed towards me.

Even though I don't think I'm really attracted to her anymore, the thought of her getting serious with someone besides me is driving me absolutely crazy.

I am 21(F) in love with a boy, who is gay (20M). He hasn't come out to anyone else and I want to and have been there for him because he needs a friend right now. The problem is that I still have feelings for him. I know nothing will happen and there is no point of my feelings but I can't help it. I spent two years thinking that he had feelings for me as well, so it's been rather difficult trying to undo those thoughts in my head. I don't fantasize about having a romantic relationship anymore, but still...

I'm obsessed with him. All I want to do his talk to him all day, I think about how to fix his personal problems all the time (e.g. coming out to his friends). As soon as something happens in my life, I imagine telling him. I want to protect him from all the ugly shit he has experienced and I imagine myself angry at anyone that has hurt him. I think the obsession is unhealthy. I spend so much of my time focusing on someone that I can't have. It's gotten to the point where I think that I will not find anyone else I love this much and will have to bury my feelings for him for the rest of my life. 

To throw a spanner in the works, I have a boyfriend. It's additionally confusing because I find myself wanting to spend more time with my gay friend than my SO. I know deep down that my bf isn't the one for me, but if I break with him than all my time with be fixated on my friend, which will add to the unhealthy obsession.

I'm trying to figure out whether he is hurting too. He's told me before that if things were different we would be together. I think sometimes we use each other as surrogate boyfriends. 

Has anyone ever been in a similar situation? 


Just looking for some advice.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey all,
I am 21(F) in love with a boy, who is gay (20M). He hasn&amp;#39;t come out to anyone else and I want to and have been there for him because he needs a friend right now. The problem is that I still have feelings for him. I know nothing will happen and there is no point of my feelings but I can&amp;#39;t help it. I spent two years thinking that he had feelings for me as well, so it&amp;#39;s been rather difficult trying to undo those thoughts in my head. I don&amp;#39;t fantasize about having a romantic relationship anymore, but still...&lt;/p&gt;

I came out as gay after meeting my first and so far only boyfriend a few years ago. That relationship fell apart because I couldn't perform sexually and was unable to open up about why because, frankly, I never trusted him. It was like I would get paralyzed, I couldn't move or even think. I think this probably is due to some sexual trauma I suffered as a child and, while I would like to think it didn't have that much effect on me, I can't really think of any other reason I would have acted like I did. There where some other reasons for that relationship ending, but that was a big part of it.

Its been a few years since then and I am a relatively happy and healthy (if a bit overweight) guy. I have a good job, friends and am generally at peace with life. I would really like to have someone else in my life at this point, but I am scared.

I worry that I am damaged goods and that I won't be able to give someone what they need sexually. I don't know how to even go about explaining to someone the panic that washes over me when I get close to somebody, or how I would even begin to get around that.

Furthermore, I don't know how to even go about looking for guys. I have plenty of straight friends, but don't know any gay people directly or even indirectly. I don't like bars and can't see a gay bar being an exception to that. Bars are too noisy and my hearing is bad to begin with. I can't imagine trying to just have anonymous sex with someone via the internet.

My reason is that there's too much of a hassle to have friends. For me, there have to be a set of rules of how to interact with people: You smile when people congratulate you on something; if someone asks you how you are, you say ""I'm fine,thank you"" and you have to ask them back; if it's someone's birthday and you're invited, you must bring a present; if someone tries to know you better, you should try to get to know them as well; the list goes on and I swear I could write a book about this if I had to. But when I get into a new situation where I haven't established a new rule for it, I become this awkward, insensitive son of a bitch who only cares about himself so after years of trying to be a normal function human being and avoid being seen that way, I decided to stop and actually became one. 

For the past few years, I have been ignoring having friendships and my life has been easier since, I don't have to worry about what to say to people, I don't have to constantly ask myself if what I'm doing or what's coming out of my mouth is appropriate, I don't have to worry that one day, a friend is gonna abandon me or something like that. I run away from people who try to be friend with me, that's basically what I do. Now, I'm not Sheldon Cooper in anyway, I can still socialize normally (in most cases) and I was fine with that until recently. I've just made a new friend (with him trying to talk to me first, and my sister giving me reasons why I should have a friend) and all the anxiety and depression come back. I always think of what to say to him and get depressed by all the thoughts like ""Ah, he's gonna see that you have a lot of problems and he will stop talking to you"" or ""Well, you're fucked dude, you're too boring to be friends with people"" or ""You're gonna run out of things to talk about and he's gonna think that you're not interested in being friends with him and he's gonna stop talking to you"", etc. I literally had to go on Google and type these things down: ""How to talk to people"" and ""How to be more active in a conversation"", that's how socially blind I am. I feel like there should be an instruction for talking to people but I can't help but feeling like an idiot for not knowing it. I like him and I want to keep talking to him but I have nothing but the old same stuff to talk about. He's such a nice person, a little flirty (which I first assumed that he was corny until he pointed it out) and I like him enough to want to be his friend but this stupid brain of mine doesn't have the program for it and at this rate, I think the friendship is going to end because of me. 

I don't even know what advice I'm seeking but I know I need to vent somewhere and this is my favorite subreddit so I want to put it here. Plus, he's a lurker on reddit so this one is for him: ""Like I told you, I don't know how to handle any kinds of relationships and this is how awkward I am, I really wish I could talk to you about this in person but I'm too afraid to do it. So whatever you choose to do with this information is up to you and I totally respect you for it.""

I'm 16 years old and a complete virgin. So I was jerking it today with a makeshift dildo and I hit a really great spot.

It was exactly like other times except there was blood in my semen and it's freaking me out.

Could it be that I'm jerking it way too much? Did I hit a blood vessel? Is this something I need to get checked out immediately? WebMD says it could be prostate cancer which is creeping me out.

Please help, guys.

For hetero hookups, I think penetrative, vaginal sex is expected, but is anal sex expected when two gay men hook up?

Like, say you meet a guy and you two hook up. Does that involve anal? Because from what I've heard, anal takes some prep to make it work right. So if you go out with the intention of getting some, do you prepare your anus for the night, or is it normal to stick to non-butt stuff the first time or for a hookup?

On a somewhat related note, how's finishing work with anal? Does the receiving guy just not get an orgasm and deals with it? Does the other guy give him a handy or a blowy?

This thought has been in my head for a while, hope you gay bros can help a straight guy out.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m genuinely curious and have no info about hookups for gay men.

So my boyfriend has been having a rough time lately. We graduated from college, and he doesn't really know what he is doing with his life since his prior plans unfortunately didn't work out. His degree also isn't the most applicable to most occupations, so he can't just apply anywhere he wants.

His parents got divorced recently and he never learned why. And he gets really emotional about this at least once each month. He also usually complains that they don't care about him (even though they definitely do care) and that they do not appreciate anything he does.

Also small problems take a huge toll on him. He cracked his phone screen and was beyond devasted, and it practically ruined the next two days since he was so emotional. A friend of ours asked why she wasn't invited out one night. It was an honest mistake on my part as I thought she wasn't in town, but he took it (again) extremely personally and was emotional for hours.

I have suggested that he talk to his family or go see a professional to talk through all of this with but he refuses to listen to me. Yet a few months ago I was going through similar issues, and he convinced me to go to a few sessions with a therapist and it really helped me.

I just want to be able to help him. I feel like I've done everything I can for him, and I think it may be time for someone else to step in to help.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;(sorry, throwaway)&lt;/p&gt;

I don't need to be in love with this guy or feel that I'm going to marry him, but I can already tell hooking up with randoms a la Queer as Folk style isn't my thing at all, even though I have nothing against people who do. My worries stem from the fact that I'm already 21 and I haven't met anyone special enough to let them fuck me. I've made out and I gave a couple friends blow jobs three years ago, but that's the last physical contact I had with another man.  
  
It seems like everyone is having sex though. Like all the gay guys are fucking and partying and then there's me. I don't want to hookup out of a relationship and I know it's just not right for me. Should I change this about myself so I don't go crazy and sexually repressed? I've talked to a lot of guys on grindr who seemed pretty eager to fuck me, but I never went there because I want a boyfriend first.  
  
But from what I see that doesn't happen anymore. I noticed a lot of gay guys fuck before dating and being boyfriends. Am I just setting myself up for a life of loneliness? Do I need to slut it up to get anywhere?  
  
People are often surprised I'm a virgin because I'm attractive and am (supposedly, according to them) total boyfriend material. Gay friends often tell me that guys my age probably don't want to date me because I'm not an easy guy they can fuck tonight, but the guy that would be right for them in a few years when they mature and want to settle down a bit for something serious. Which sounds like a great compliment, but I'm also a man. I have to wait through years of loneliness before being happier?  
  
And straight people can do it. My best girlfriends have had a few boyfriends over the course of our college careers. If straight guys are capable of being in a relationship before fucking, I don't see how gay guys can't either.  
  
It's not the end of the world. I'm just worried that I'm wasting my youth or approaching ""gay death"" as some people say. I don't want to get to a point where no one wants me because I'm an old virgin and they want someone with more experience, which in turn makes my quest for a relationship first to be even harder.
