TL;DR: This is my personal experience with growing up being gay, attracted to older men, in a catholic holsehold in Brazil, with major depression, suicidal thoughts, anxiety and mild alcoholism. It's a long story, and those are all trigger warnings. You have been warned.

There are still many teenagers and adults who are depressed and feeling alone - I just hope this post will show those people that they are not alone, it's okay to feel that way, and it *does* get better. As cheesy and overdone that message is, it's true. There's links to resources, information and phone numbers for help below on mental illness, abuse and addiction. So here it goes.

I grew up in a very conservative catholic household. After school I helped my parents with a store we had all afternoon. On saturdays I would attend to catechesis, and on sundays we'd go to church. We were all very close, I was raised with the understanding that family was the most important thing in the world. I have two sisters, but it was implied that my parents were most proud of me, their only boy.

Since I was a toddler I knew I was gay, but figured it was just a phase, or that god was testing me somehow. However, as I grew older, I realized those feelings were not going away. I prayed for god to make me “normal” so I could have the perfect life I thought I wanted: have a wife and kids, to make my parents happy and proud. So I started to feel alone, depressed and like a freak. To make things worse, I was attracted to men much older than me, for no apparent reason - make no mistake, my dad loved me and he was my hero, I didn't have any issues then. It was just my preference. So even within the gay community I felt I didn't fit. I wasn't feminine or liked feminine stuff (absolutely nothing wrong with that, by the way). At one point I remember being terrified of being gay because I thought if I ever got married, I would have to wear a dress (silly, kid me). Plus, I wasn't attracted to boys my age, only men over forty. I constantly felt like there was just something so inherently wrong with me that even the freaks seemed normal.

So there was no way I could have a relationship. There was no way my parents would accept it - any of it. I wouldn’t be able to bring a boyfriend home to have mom’s lasagna, go to the beach and take pictures with. And I wouldn’t be able to bring home a future wife or have kids, either. They wouldn’t be proud. They would be devastated. And I would die loveless, and alone - because I was a freak.

One day, at more-or-less thirteen years old, I was in the store helping while mom was in the sidewalk talking to her friend. Then I heard her say, aloud: “If I was pregnant with a baby, and god told me it was gay, I would just ask him to get rid of it - I just wouldn’t be able to love him”.

I stopped for a second, processing what I had just heard. At first, I didn’t feel anything. It was like all of my emotions were just turned off simultaneously. Mom came back in, and asked if I was alright. I said I was hungry and needed to go upstairs to eat something. I went to my bedroom, sat on my bed, and stared at the wall. Then it came. Slowly, crawling up my guts. A deep, cold sorrow was being installed in me. *So they hate me, then*, I thought. It didn't help that dad constantly asked me if I thought 'that girl was attractive' or ask me if he could name my first born. I lied down, and cried. Cried like I never had in my entire life. I felt so guilty, as if it was somehow my fault. So I had already given up on all prospect of having any kind of relationship, and the only love I knew, I felt that was *gone*.

After a while mom came upstairs and I feel like at that moment something happened to me, something that I still deal with to this day. She came to check up on me and I went to the bathroom so she couldn't see the mess that I was and fix myself up. I looked at the mirror, and I felt it. Two feelings. The first one was hate. I hated everything that I saw in the reflection. If I could just cease to exist, disappear, die, or whatever, however I could, I would. And I hated my family - which only led me to feel guilty and hate myself even more. The second feeling was loneliness. I felt completely exiled from my family. I knew that I was *completely by myself* from now on, because there was just no way they would accept me. So I opened the tap, washed my face, dried it with a towel, and smiled to myself. After that and in the years that came, I faked every single emotion. Pretended to be happy. Smiled. Held back my tears. I became a pro at it. To this day it takes a lot to make me cry. It's almost as if I forgot how to do it properly. The only person I can share open feelings with is my SO. But it's gotten better.

What followed was a regular, bright, happy kid turn into a cold, depressed, reckless individual. Since I figured they didn’t care about me, then I didn’t give a damn about me either. It didn't help that after I let go of catholicism to become an atheist I didn't go to church anymore or anything - they became very passive agressive about it. Or that I liked rock and roll and metal, which they would tell me constantly to stop listening because it was ""satanic music"". Or that mom would tell me everyday to eat more because I was too skinny, and she wanted me to be more fat and muscular like the other boys. When I was a kid she even gave me medicine to get taller because she thought I was too short. So I didn't even know the difference anymore between who was me and who they manipulated me into. Frankly, I didn't care. Everything right I did was ""what I was supposed to do"" and everything they thought was wrong with me needed to be changed.

By the time I was a teenager I could barely get out of bed anymore. I forced myself to, just so no one would notice anything. I also couldn't sleep. The only way I would sleep was by drinking alcohol from my dad's tiny bottles of alcohol collection. Most of them were transparent, so I just refilled with water and no one would notice. So almost every night I would drink myself to sleep. Then I would wake up and rush to the bathroom to shower, brush my teeth, perfume, refill the bottles, hide all the traces that anything was wrong and run off to school. And when I didn't, I would stay up all night. And remember. Feel. And when I did fall asleep, I would have nightmares. Most of them were me falling to my death - the prospect was oddly comforting to me, but falling wasn't exactly fun, and waking up was worse. Others were me running from something. Then I would wake up in a sweaty panic attack. I exclusively used alcohol to black me out to sleep - I just didn't want to stay awake and deal with my life, or see the nightmares, or *feel* anything. But after a couple months, if I stayed too long without it, my hands would start shaking. It never went past that, because I would always drink again soon enough, so I never had to really deal with the withdraw. The only time I did was the last time I drank, and after a couple of months I was fine. I never really did like alcohol - just sleeping and not having to feel anything for a while. Today, the taste or smell of it makes me sick, for more reasons than one. But I don't think I was an alcoholic.

At sixteen, I tried to kill myself for the first time. Everyone was away for the weekend, had all that time by myself. I didn't want to be over-dramatic about it, so the only thing I wrote in my note was ""I'm gay. I'm sorry."", and that was it. Just not to leave them hanging wondering why. That was what started it all. Plain, simple. No need to make them hate themselves more by saying they were also part of the reason - I didn't want to be that cruel. I was already being selfish enough. But I was done. I just wanted out. I was sick of my life, and just didn't see myself living past my twenties. I had no plans for a career - I just didn't give a shit. So I drank some alcohol with a handful of pills, and went to bed - hoping to not wake up again. Fortunately - and clearly - I did. I woke up. My stomach was on fire. I passed out for the whole noon, hadn't eaten much, and felt like puking. I went to the bathroom to take a shower, and passed out again for a couple of minutes. I woke up - fallen in the shower floor, water still running, and puked all over myself. I cleaned myself up, made something to eat, ate, cleaned all the evidence, and just lied in bed, feeling worthless. Even *that* I couldn't do properly. I hid everything from my family afterwards, and pretended everything was fine. No one noticed anything, and after a couple days my stomach stopped hurting. A couple weeks after I found out my dad had a gun in an old shoebox on his wardrobe. I tried to do something with it, but it was very rusty and the trigger didn't work, plus the round thing where the bullets go was also stuck. Thank god for that.

On a sorta unrelated note: what also happened when I was sixteen was that I bought an acoustic guitar. I didn't know anything about music besides what I listened on my MP4, I just decided to be a hipster and get one. Now, I don't want to be *that guy* and say music saved his life, but it did provide me a very much welcome distraction to silence my inner demons. It was one of the best decisions I've ever made in my life, and that guitar is still very dear to me to this day. Helped a lot to get through those dark times. So this is my personal advice. Even if you think you can't do shit with an instrument like I did, get one. You don't need to be Paul McCartney. All you need to be is yourself. Don't play for an audience. Play for you, and even your mistakes will sound good. Music makes life more colourful. Moving on..

Fast forward a year. I managed to graduate high school, god knows how. Older sister had been away to a big metropolis for the last half decade, so now she had a flat and I moved in with her, away from my parents. I came out to her. She was supportive but asked me ""to be a man, not a fag with a lisp"". So I didn't really talk to her much about it after that. I had a glimpse of hope - maybe things would get better without them around, me being independent. They didn't. I was still the same, shit still sucked. After a couple weeks I got my first real job easy, given I had the experience from helping my parents at the store. Months later I had my first sexual encounter. I downloaded Scruff on my phone, and had a random married man in. Sis had her own job and college, so she didn't really stay in the flat, I was alone 95% of the time. He had a wife so he wanted to be discreet, and I didn't want anyone to find out, so that was perfect. Three days of texting and he came in - I didn't meet him, and he hadn't even sent me a face picture because wife. I knew that was reckless, but I still didn't really care whether he gave me STDs or kidnapped and killed me. I was just a horny, stupid kid who didn't care if he lived to see the next sunset or not. So he came by, shook my hand, said hi, and stood there. He didn't make a move so I just figured he wanted me to go at it. I dropped to my knees, undid his pants and blew him. After a while he started to get close and just fucked my throat and came. I didn't even feel it. He pulled himself together, nodded, shook my hand again and left. And that was it. Half-way through it I had lost my boner. It wasn't at all like I expected. I hated it - to the point of questioning if I was really even gay or what. I went to the shower to try and jerk myself off, but it took me a while to cum. I felt horrible. He had just used me, cheated on his wife, and I let him do it. I *knew* that I would feel *exactly this way* afterwards - but I did it anyway. I thought I deserved it.

A couple weeks after, I felt really done. I wasn't happy with my job. I didn't feel like anything was improving with me ""taking care of myself"" on my own for the first time, or my sister knowing I was gay. I still felt depressed, hated myself and wanted to die. If anything this made things worse. I didn't have alcohol anymore, my sister liked wine but I couldn't drink much or she would notice. I had nightmares every night and I couldn't sleep or work properly, and my anxiety didn't help - in highschool I was ""fine"" because I could just ignore everyone. Now I was being forced to talk to people everyday. I had no idea what I wanted to do for college, I didn't even want to do it, plus I had no means of paying for it - it would take a year or two of working to gather enough money to start anyways. As a young adult, I also decided I really couldn't have a relationship. I thought no one could ever love me. How would they? No one in their right mind would date someone like me - especially the men I would date. Plus, I didn't trust anyone. You cannot be trustworthy if you don't trust anyone. I would just do what I had been doing all along: I'd push them away. Everyone was better off without me. No one should have to stick around to deal with me and see the ugly end. I was just saving them. And I didn't want to get even more hurt than I already was.

After a couple days, I did it again. My sister is an absolute hypochondriac. She had a shoebox full of pills. There was enough in there to kill myself three times. So I tried again. I gulped three handfulls of whatever the fuck was in that box, and it all went down with wine. I drank the whole bottle, and collapsed on the bed. I closed my eyes and I felt peaceful. There was no way I would survive - or so I thought.

My sister came through the door and found me. She yelled, screamed, cried and shook me by the shoulders to wake me up. She asked what happened, I told her I just tried to kill myself. When she asked why, I sat there in silence. Ashamed. She then ranted on how I was a selfish little fuck, that I had no consideration for anyone but myself, that I was so selfish to do that to her after all everyone did to get me there and how she let me live with her and helped me with everything, how she'd tell mom and send me back because she just couldn't deal with that kind of bullshit and that I had no reason to want to die. And then she told me she would rather have found me dead.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello, everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

I exclusively used alcohol to black me out to sleep - I just didn&amp;#39;t want to stay awake and deal with my life, or see the nightmares, or &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; anything. But after a couple months, if I stayed too long without it, my hands would start shaking. It never went past that, because I would always drink again soon enough, so I never had to really deal with the withdraw. The only time I did was the last time I drank, and after a couple of months I was fine. I never really did like alcohol - just sleeping and not having to feel anything for a while. Today, the taste or smell of it makes me sick, for more reasons than one. But I don&amp;#39;t think I was an alcoholic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At sixteen, I tried to kill myself for the first time. Everyone was away for the weekend, had all that time by myself. I didn&amp;#39;t want to be over-dramatic about it, so the only thing I wrote in my note was &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m gay. I&amp;#39;m sorry.&amp;quot;, and that was it. Just not to leave them hanging wondering why. That was what started it all. Plain, simple. No need to make them hate themselves more by saying they were also part of the reason - I didn&amp;#39;t want to be that cruel. I was already being selfish enough. But I was done. I just wanted out. I was sick of my life, and just didn&amp;#39;t see myself living past my twenties. I had no plans for a career - I just didn&amp;#39;t give a shit. So I drank some alcohol with a handful of pills, and went to bed - hoping to not wake up again. Fortunately - and clearly - I did. I woke up. My stomach was on fire. I passed out for the whole noon, hadn&amp;#39;t eaten much, and felt like puking. I went to the bathroom to take a shower, and passed out again for a couple of minutes. I woke up - fallen in the shower floor, water still running, and puked all over myself. I cleaned myself up, made something to eat, ate, cleaned all the evidence, and just lied in bed, feeling worthless. Even &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; I couldn&amp;#39;t do properly. I hid everything from my family afterwards, and pretended everything was fine. No one noticed anything, and after a couple days my stomach stopped hurting. A couple weeks after I found out my dad had a gun in an old shoebox on his wardrobe. I tried to do something with it, but it was very rusty and the trigger didn&amp;#39;t work, plus the round thing where the bullets go was also stuck. Thank god for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a sorta unrelated note: what also happened when I was sixteen was that I bought an acoustic guitar. I didn&amp;#39;t know anything about music besides what I listened on my MP4, I just decided to be a hipster and get one. Now, I don&amp;#39;t want to be &lt;em&gt;that guy&lt;/em&gt; and say music saved his life, but it did provide me a very much welcome distraction to silence my inner demons. It was one of the best decisions I&amp;#39;ve ever made in my life, and that guitar is still very dear to me to this day. Helped a lot to get through those dark times. So this is my personal advice. Even if you think you can&amp;#39;t do shit with an instrument like I did, get one. You don&amp;#39;t need to be Paul McCartney. All you need to be is yourself. Don&amp;#39;t play for an audience. Play for you, and even your mistakes will sound good. Music makes life more colourful. Moving on..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward a year. I managed to graduate high school, god knows how. Older sister had been away to a big metropolis for the last half decade, so now she had a flat and I moved in with her, away from my parents. I came out to her. She was supportive but asked me &amp;quot;to be a man, not a fag with a lisp&amp;quot;. So I didn&amp;#39;t really talk to her much about it after that. I had a glimpse of hope - maybe things would get better without them around, me being independent. They didn&amp;#39;t. I was still the same, shit still sucked. After a couple weeks I got my first real job easy, given I had the experience from helping my parents at the store. Months later I had my first sexual encounter. I downloaded Scruff on my phone, and had a random married man in. Sis had her own job and college, so she didn&amp;#39;t really stay in the flat, I was alone 95% of the time. He had a wife so he wanted to be discreet, and I didn&amp;#39;t want anyone to find out, so that was perfect. Three days of texting and he came in - I didn&amp;#39;t meet him, and he hadn&amp;#39;t even sent me a face picture because wife. I knew that was reckless, but I still didn&amp;#39;t really care whether he gave me STDs or kidnapped and killed me. I was just a horny, stupid kid who didn&amp;#39;t care if he lived to see the next sunset or not. So he came by, shook my hand, said hi, and stood there. He didn&amp;#39;t make a move so I just figured he wanted me to go at it. I dropped to my knees, undid his pants and blew him. After a while he started to get close and just fucked my throat and came. I didn&amp;#39;t even feel it. He pulled himself together, nodded, shook my hand again and left. And that was it. Half-way through it I had lost my boner. It wasn&amp;#39;t at all like I expected. I hated it - to the point of questioning if I was really even gay or what. I went to the shower to try and jerk myself off, but it took me a while to cum. I felt horrible. He had just used me, cheated on his wife, and I let him do it. I &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; that I would feel &lt;em&gt;exactly this way&lt;/em&gt; afterwards - but I did it anyway. I thought I deserved it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple weeks after, I felt really done. I wasn&amp;#39;t happy with my job. I didn&amp;#39;t feel like anything was improving with me &amp;quot;taking care of myself&amp;quot; on my own for the first time, or my sister knowing I was gay. I still felt depressed, hated myself and wanted to die. If anything this made things worse. I didn&amp;#39;t have alcohol anymore, my sister liked wine but I couldn&amp;#39;t drink much or she would notice. I had nightmares every night and I couldn&amp;#39;t sleep or work properly, and my anxiety didn&amp;#39;t help - in highschool I was &amp;quot;fine&amp;quot; because I could just ignore everyone. Now I was being forced to talk to people everyday. I had no idea what I wanted to do for college, I didn&amp;#39;t even want to do it, plus I had no means of paying for it - it would take a year or two of working to gather enough money to start anyways. As a young adult, I also decided I really couldn&amp;#39;t have a relationship. I thought no one could ever love me. How would they? No one in their right mind would date someone like me - especially the men I would date. Plus, I didn&amp;#39;t trust anyone. You cannot be trustworthy if you don&amp;#39;t trust anyone. I would just do what I had been doing all along: I&amp;#39;d push them away. Everyone was better off without me. No one should have to stick around to deal with me and see the ugly end. I was just saving them. And I didn&amp;#39;t want to get even more hurt than I already was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a couple days, I did it again. My sister is an absolute hypochondriac. She had a shoebox full of pills. There was enough in there to kill myself three times. So I tried again. I gulped three handfulls of whatever the fuck was in that box, and it all went down with wine. I drank the whole bottle, and collapsed on the bed. I closed my eyes and I felt peaceful. There was no way I would survive - or so I thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My sister came through the door and found me. She yelled, screamed, cried and shook me by the shoulders to wake me up. She asked what happened, I told her I just tried to kill myself. When she asked why, I sat there in silence. Ashamed. She then ranted on how I was a selfish little fuck, that I had no consideration for anyone but myself, that I was so selfish to do that to her after all everyone did to get me there and how she let me live with her and helped me with everything, how she&amp;#39;d tell mom and send me back because she just couldn&amp;#39;t deal with that kind of bullshit and that I had no reason to want to die. And then she told me she would rather have found me dead.&lt;/p&gt;

It was for an innocent reason; I was just looking to try to find someone to help me practice some things and to also possibly make a friend along the way. He contacted me about it and he seemed like a cool guy, so I thought that I could have an awesome thing going on.

I got to know him more and I slowly discovered all these similarities we had, like shared interests, perspectives on certain things, some of our favorite things, etc. It ranged from things I'm extremely passionate about and love to small things that might only be notable to me. I don't think I'm exaggerating in saying it's rare to find some of these attributes in other gay guys, so finding it all in one person and being friends with him makes me feel so lucky. And I eventually saw what he looks like and he's really cute.

Our homes are very far from each other, so we never had the chance to actually meet in person until recently. We hung out, and it made me fully realize just how amazing he is. I was having some problems with guys—things like trying to get to know them and dealing with people's excuses—but meeting up with him made me forget everyone else. To me he is just so charming and friendly with a great sense of humor. He met some friends of mine as well (though I've known him longer than them) and he left a good impression on them too. One of my closer friends told me that she thought he was so attractive, nice, and intelligent. Apparently she also has a good gaydar because she told me that she was trying to argue that he was gay to another girl that thought he was attractive. She asked me if there was anything between us, and I said no. She asked me why not and told me that I should get at it and try talking to him.

That's the thing. I really don't know what I should do. There are so many things going on in my head and I have so many doubts. While he is everything I would ever want in a partner, he's also an invaluable friend. Right now, I feel like I'm not as close to him as I would like. We do know quite a bit about each other, but I don't know much about how everything is going with his love life and other kinds of intimate details. I guess that's understandable considering the distance and not really having had the opportunity to hang out, but I still wish we were closer. Because of that I don't know if he's even single at the moment. I don't know how he feels about me. I know he likes me enough to be my friend, but I don't know if I'm just one of his many friends. And I'm here thinking about him constantly. I value his friendship a lot, so I wouldn't want him to suddenly feel awkward because he doesn't or can't reciprocate my feelings toward him.

There's also the issue with distance. Right now I'll have the opportunity to be able to see him more often, but it's not like we'd be able to everyday or even every week. And eventually we won't have much of a chance to see each other anymore at all. So even if he did share the same feelings for me, I don't know how we'd even work it out since we're not in the position to make any dramatic moves.

Right now, I'm just planning on trying to hang out with him more and get a little closer to him and scope out those details about his life. He really is my idea of the perfect guy, but I don't want to lose having an amazing friend either.

I just want other people's opinions on this. Would it be worth while to try to be something more and enjoy it while it lasts? Or should I cherish what we have and just leave it as a good friendship? Or is there anything else I'm not thinking of?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I met this guy on the Internet, and we&amp;#39;ve been in somewhat periodic contact for more than a year. It was for an innocent reason; I was just looking to try to find someone to help me practice some things and to also possibly make a friend along the way. He contacted me about it and he seemed like a cool guy, so I thought that I could have an awesome thing going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got to know him more and I slowly discovered all these similarities we had, like shared interests, perspectives on certain things, some of our favorite things, etc. It ranged from things I&amp;#39;m extremely passionate about and love to small things that might only be notable to me. I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;m exaggerating in saying it&amp;#39;s rare to find some of these attributes in other gay guys, so finding it all in one person and being friends with him makes me feel so lucky. And I eventually saw what he looks like and he&amp;#39;s really cute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our homes are very far from each other, so we never had the chance to actually meet in person until recently. We hung out, and it made me fully realize just how amazing he is. I was having some problems with guys—things like trying to get to know them and dealing with people&amp;#39;s excuses—but meeting up with him made me forget everyone else. To me he is just so charming and friendly with a great sense of humor. He met some friends of mine as well (though I&amp;#39;ve known him longer than them) and he left a good impression on them too. One of my closer friends told me that she thought he was so attractive, nice, and intelligent. Apparently she also has a good gaydar because she told me that she was trying to argue that he was gay to another girl that thought he was attractive. She asked me if there was anything between us, and I said no. She asked me why not and told me that I should get at it and try talking to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the thing. I really don&amp;#39;t know what I should do. There are so many things going on in my head and I have so many doubts. While he is everything I would ever want in a partner, he&amp;#39;s also an invaluable friend. Right now, I feel like I&amp;#39;m not as close to him as I would like. We do know quite a bit about each other, but I don&amp;#39;t know much about how everything is going with his love life and other kinds of intimate details. I guess that&amp;#39;s understandable considering the distance and not really having had the opportunity to hang out, but I still wish we were closer.

&gt; It Takes Me Away, The Soul We Share

It is such a beautiful day outside today. On the road, in my mind, across the brunt of my face I feel the sweeping melody of a cold wind. The passive heat of a subdued sun set out in the suffused heat streams in and through to my hands and knees. I love driving, it takes my mind out of the course of the day and into a world of fantasy. The world no matter how large or small is mine to be explored, populated with names and faces and events that I seek to stay, put on and through, its the thorough thoughts of me and you.

Your face, your name, your birthday (two days away from mine). Something inside me changed the day I met you; its a feeling Ive felt only once before. And all the damage the last time did incur, I shrink to say I could and can. I want where I need but I have trained myself diligently to remain senseless in the sight of pride or pleasure to the ends of pain. Thats my normal state. I expect to feel pain, and I expect to be hurt. So then the surprise, the sumptuous joy thats phasing through my skin. I say your name to myself, in my head. Its so close to mine.

Thats my normal state: to hurt. Right away you knew it. There was something inside of us that when complimentary matched did appearance make, when we first touched we knew we were one. Its amazing, to have gone through my whole life and at the most truly random interval to find you like you were waiting for me. With a grain, a dash of salt, its not to be taken lightly; I was waiting for you. You are so beautiful, inside and out. You are the most amazing human being I have ever come across. I can tell in the air between us, the painted glory of a face with feeling, when I catch your eyes. When we lay in bed and I moved over, I nudged and when the time was right, I held your hand and rested my head on your shoulder.

I died that day. The old me that ached endlessly without hope or connection or a reason to call myself a member. I was opposed to the race, I was the blackened soot caked over an ivory temple to the delights of love. Where there grew flowers, when there was providence to fate, when I was a nice guy, I had a reason to love. I had to stay alive, just to think again some time would come when no longer I would finish last. You loved it, the things I showed you. You felt them, the things I told you. You are me, the way you hold me. Your body and mind, through shuttered time, its only a spatial-geographic rift that kept us apart. It is the world cut in half that you and I together do mend the divide.

Its pain, the normal state. When you told me you (of all people) of ALL people tried to hurt yourself, I cried. For the first time in a long time I cried because of someone whom I did come to love more than just for the sake of sexuality. I dont know which is yours, I dont care to live in labels. You even told me this before I told you. You tried to kill yourself. I cant believe you did something so foolish. Im so angry about it. Pain is my normal state, I know what you were feeling, I know the preparations and the sensations and the masochistic mechanizations that deride your sense of reason to rationalize a senseless demise.

I feel so little of late, I was bare and dry, scraped too thinly and made to last too long. I know what you mean, I was there. But now I am angry, I cant make sense of it. You are so beautiful, you are so amazing and kind, the medicine you take is a sham and a lie you place upon the world so in its recesses and quiet spaces you can hide. I hate that youre doing this. I know what its like to feel the things subdued and how to ease a mind unglued. I am so angry that another human being endures what I go through. I hate it so much. Its not enough for me to write it here. I cant imagine the descriptive power through exponential enumeration with which I would have to undertake just to impart and impress upon the people of this world how unfairly you view yourself, how cruel it is that you have to feel the way you do.

Just because you are beautiful and kind. I wont encourage you to be gay, I am so glad you are bisexual and that you can have the life I cannot live. God damn it, I am so mad that you have to hurt. Let me take it, its normal for me, let me take the darkness that cuts at your ankles and breaks at your knees, the sweeping miasma of churning, boiling, writhing, roiling anger that casts in judgement of you the way you feel to be made to be lesser than any other man: for you are the greatest man I know. You are so beautiful and kind, in hand and in heart. The way you looked at me, the way our fingers folded as if in fate they were molded to meet, at this place and time, the nexus of you and I. The pain I have felt, it takes me away.

Because for once, not just in lust or in ego, for the first time in my life I am in love with another human being and not just in love for the sake of believing. My faith has fallen, my empire is a crumbled ruin. I am dead and decayed, eroded and betrayed and I lay in the endless lone and level sands of a world undone by the cruel and uncaring thoughts of all they and them who cannot understand me. They do not understand you either. Thats why you hurt. Thats why I am afraid. And I am so angry at you for what youve tried to do. I am so hurt by that foolish BULLSHIT that you tried to do to yourself. I am in tears every night knowing somewhere in the course of your day a kernel of hatred pops and bursts forth into existence. That you hurt. I hate it. I cant control myself when I think about you hurting. I expect myself to hurt but I cant stand for my brother, my spirit's companion, the person I love most for being the best and truest to himself, I cant stand for him to hurt like I do.

Let me take it, let me take myself away with your pain. Let our shared soul be cleansed and made bright and renewed in the bathing light of a beautiful day. Look outside, its me that is in the distance thinking about you. Breathe the air, its flowing and whirling where staleness at last, at long long last does lift its gripping hand of dulled misgivings. Walk upon the earth, consecrated in my blood. I bleed myself dry in your honor. You are the man that both of us could be, the image of the most beautiful form of ourselves. You are the guardian of my and our heart, and you will go on, my lifes work will be dedicated to providing for you where I could, as much as I can, for as long as it takes. Im so mad that you tried to hurt yourself that Ive been having to take little moments from my day to cry about it. I cant let that go on. I will shower you in affection and money and attention and everything I can hope to accomplish I will do in your name.

They, these people around us, who call themselves our comrades sometimes give the worst advice. Theres nothing for it for me to believe theres something to be found under the granite layers of vulcanized compassion, the obsidian edge of my most self-aware sensations and feelings. What I live for cannot be myself, for it only contains the language of constraint, for me to drive myself to ruin. I wont allow you to hurt where I do, I will prevent this. I will stand in for the holes in the world, I will lift you up at whatever expense. I love you. I finally love as much as can be true. My life is complete, here in the cooling air inside my vintage car, my dreams are coming to an end and victory is in sight. I will complete you and then I will be gone, to show you just how important you are and forever leave you with the impression that you must go on, for you will carry my world when I am gone. Your love takes me away, and the soul we share will be completed for it. I love you, man. You are my best friend.
