I'm not quite sure how to write this post, but I'm going to try anyway. For the last few years, I haven't really been able to control my drinking in a healthy way. I’m not to the point where I get the shakes if I don’t have a drink in the morning. I’m not to the point where I’ve destroyed all of my relationships. But, every time I drink, I lose control, embarrass myself, and feel like shit the next day. I wake up mortified, ashamed, and really angry with myself. I’ve tried to “take a drinking break” for a week or two, or go to wet events sober, but I lose my resolve.  

The biggest thing that scares me about my drinking habits is that I feel helpless over my drinking. While it’s not completely damaging right now, I’m not sure I could stop if it came down to it. 

Does anyone have any advice or thoughts about this all? I need some guidance, bros. 

I’ve thought about checking out a few AA meetings in my area. I’ve been to a few meetings with my sister (an alcoholic in the program), and it seems all right. The only problem I have with it is that I don’t want to give up my lifestyle and social world to the AA scene. I’m also worried that as a gay person, I won’t find a home. Do any bros in the program have any knowledge about these things?

I asked him multiple times if he was sure. He said yes. I blow him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boom, morning. He feels betrayed and angry at me for the deed. Argues inability to consent (despite having some judgment/autonomy?). We&amp;#39;re not talking right now; I&amp;#39;m giving him some space. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He comes from a very liberal family, not homophobic either (obviously). Am I in the wrong? Should he take accountability for his choices? I think maybe we&amp;#39;re both to blame, but the overreactions seems to reveal a more personable problem. This was the first time he&amp;#39;s done anything sexual with another person. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems a lot like straight post-gay sex regret to me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how should I navigate through this issue without possibly obliterating our friendship? Any inputs? &lt;/p&gt;

I am not a bar rat. I go out once or twice a month, and since I live in a bigger city where I can choose to go to different bars I always do so, that way when I do my rounds I remain fresh meat lol. However I am not involved nor I want to be part of anything gay related such bowling nights, volunteering at the LGBT Community Center, support organizations and things like that.

The reason why I asked this question its because recently a friend invited me to go to Pride Fest (watch the parade, and things) so I politely declined, he insisted and I said to him ""I don't care about those things"" His reaction was a surprised, he was not expecting me to say that - apparently; then he proceeded to lecture me on how as a gay man I should be involved with the community, how I should continue and carry the legacy that started at Stonewall back in 1968...OMG yes he did lol he was all that passionate then I was the surprised one to hear all that speech from him.

I feel (and this is my own personal opinion, which I might be wrong so please don't be offended) that Pride fest is nothing but a freak show, an excuse for freaks to come out wearing speedos on the streets in broad daylight, an excuse for druggies to do drugs and those who do the recreational drugs occasionally on events such pride and holiday weekends. Of course I didn't say that to my friend because I learned at a very young age not to let everything I think to slip out of my mouth.

Please don't judge me but that's how I feel. I don't want to volunteer at the gay hospice, give money to gay non profits organization or attend to organized gay events, support a dragqueen who's doing a pageant...I just don't care about to be part of the community other than hanging out at the gay bars every now and then or the gay resorts in FL or CA when I do ""gay vacations"". 

Am I alone on this? Did he overreact? The fact that I am not involved in politics or can careless less if the LGBT community center burns down, does that make me a ""bad"" gay?
