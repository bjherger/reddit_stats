I just was kind of paging through links and i realized how fun it would be if i actually knew this many boys!  So i was wondering how normal it is to be a part of a group of gay guy friends versus my position which is where i dont even have one gay guy friend.  

I feel kind of jealous when i see other guys in groups at the bar or something and i cant figure out why im never a part of something like that.  i think in general im a little sensitive when it comes to feelings and i really have high standards of how much sharing there is between friends.  I dont really think of myself as a ladies man, inside i really see myself as someone who would be complete if i could end up being one of the guys.  i wanna work out in the sun, and listen to music all throughout the house, beer bottles everywhere, no one wears shirts, playing ping pong and wearing sunglasses inside, smokin weed and maybe even a few hug-it-out moments between horseplay.  

Oh i dont know though!  I really want to have some kind of dynamic with guys for once without any girls involved.  i love my girls and sometimes i hang out with my guy friends but im always just being passive cause i dont want to make anyone uncomfortable.  that kind of makes me upset too that i frame my interactions with boys based on how i think my being gay will make them uncomfortable.

Its only rare times like when i got to spend time with a guy last night that show me that i actually do have a lot of love in me and its just suspended and hung up until i have some kind of genuine interaction.  I am long passed being able to take part in things like grindr.  i just feel soulless on there.

Last night i was hanging with my bestest girl friend and her new guy and it was so amazing when i started having a connection with the guy.  Idk what it was but i felt compelled the whole time, like i couldnt stop myself.  Hes so gorgeous and i know its pointless to think like that but its just the truth.  He likes all the same stuff as me and is so fun and likes all my jokes and we have the same refinement to our taste in movies.  I got a chance to pull away with only him for a short while by making a run to the liquor store.  We talked about my girl friend for a bit until we got into the ""i love you mans"" and it was so shocking to be received with so much complementarity.  I put my arm around him and he looked at me with his big eyes and i just felt like my whole body became flush with heat.  I was so happy, he just wanted to get to know me a little and give me some attention.  

When we got back i made some more rounds of drinks only this time he and i were next to each other and i sat on the bed with them.  He scooted over and made sure our arms were touching.  and i just was as still as when i cant disturb my sleeping kitty cat.  And i melted, i stretched out and got on his foot with my foot and snuggled my face up on him.  I guess i was probably crossing the line in being overly affectionate but i cant help myself.

And maybe when i cant help myself i cant find a way to properly channel my feelings into something constructive.  I mean, case in point even though he and i were having guy-bonding affection he was still leaning over to occasionally kiss her, or whisper something cute to her.  I know i cant wish for it, but i cant help but imagine what it would be like if there was actually a biological response for *wanting* a gay person to be there for you.  I feel like if reception of the love of a gay person in addition to the love of the person they desire were the way of things, and relationship dynamics had to include a gay person, i would have died and gone to heaven.  I just want to be a part of the love that gets shared.

And im a nice enough person!  I think people are very complimentary of me because i really try hard to be brave and put on my best and strongest face and be a tough boy who doesnt crack under the weight of his own isolation from the humanity he craves.  But sometimes i wish, instead of it always being me that lights up the room and is everyones wild-card for good times, that i was a real functional part of some kind of relationship with a real guy!  I dont like the way gay people treat each other, i want the experience my girl friend is having, where a guy is all out to prove his honesty and worth and demonstrate the extent of his cuteness and depth of love.  

I feel like so much of my cognition is dedicated to the appreciation of boys that I cant imagine what it would be like when i actually fulfill that void in my heart.  If that day even comes, will I have the strength to take the world in my hands and forge my identity at last?  I cant be all that i am or accept myself until i see a reflection of myself in another, i feel too alien and strange.  I need brotherhood, and love, and friendship, and kindly tempered strength and masculinity.  I need a boy to love.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I come here so often when im really, just totally wallowing in a pool of self-pity or am on the verge of emotional collapse but i dont know why today is different.

Everyone decent I talk to disappears. Then there are the other guys who I'll talk to for a bit, then they'll just stop replying, but I can see they are online, but I don't want to be one of those guys who can't take a hint.

Then there's the old guys who throw compliments/offers at me left, right and centre but they're just not what I'm looking for.

Doesn't matter what kind of picture I use, face or torso, as soon as I think, hmm maybe I could meet this guy in the real world, they disappear.

I'm nice, I talk, I reply to literally everyone in the hopes that someone might turn out to be someone I can meet but as soon as I think hmmm, maybe I could meet them, they disappear or stop talking.

I also only ever see the same guys over and over again. For a city of 1mill+ surely there is more than 20 gay guys out there around my age? I'm literally on Tinder, Grindr, Jack'd and Hornet. Typing that (and this) makes me sound desperate but honestly I don't know what I'm doing wrong.

I'm fit, I'm toned, I'm pretty good looking. I don't 'talk gay' or 'act gay' or whatever it is people seem to be interested but I don't go advertising that around because it's dumb? The only thing I can think of about myself 'physically' that might be putting people off is my height. I'm only 5'4"" and I have it on my profiles because I figure people should know rather than turn up and see me in person and be disappointed but I feel like it's what might be stopping anyone from maintaining contact with me.

Gah, I don't know. I guess I'm just lonely and tired of waiting to find someone after all these years of being alone and wondering why nothing is happening for me and I just needed to vent.

Also, for what it's worth I've used both kinds of lube with two tops. One who is 8"" and thick (a true 8""x6"") and another who is 5.5-6"" and kind of thick.

Are Tinder and OkCupid the best ways to go about finding dates? I assume the bar/club scene is mostly for hook-ups, with the possible exception of the new Cathedral Station, which is now my favorite bar in town. Is there a place that laid back, quiet, and non-judgmental that may cater to the somewhat younger 20s crowd, or is dating in my general age bracket asking for too much?

I talked to my friend who has been withdrawn.  It turns out she doesn't know how to deal with our friendship.  She doesn't trust me because of the aftermath of falling out with my ex.  She doesn't want what happened to him and I to happen to me and her.  (the falling out was ugly and almost completely my fault).

I assured her that what happened between him and I is not what I ever want to happen and that I would commit myself to make sure that it wouldn't.  

She said that she was feeling conflicting feelings about our friendship because I had been a great friend to her so far.  She said she felt shitty because she kept of trying to find reason why our friendship wasn't as good as it appears, because I had incredibly nice to her.  She said she never expected this friendship to progress like it did.  She also said she said she should be completely content, but she doesn't know why she doesn't.  Now she doesn't know what to do.

I told her that my behavior towards my ex made me ashamed, and I understood why he wouldn't forgive me, and that I realized that I had been selfish and hadn't considered his feelings at all.  

I also told her that I was grateful for the friendship we shared, and I didn't want to fell like I was placing a burden on her.  I just wanted everyone to be at peace.  I promised her that I would work on our friendship because she was important to me and that I cared about her.  I end the conversation that after break if she wanted to sit down and talk about it that we could.

Now I don't know what my next move should be.  I am a little lost in how to deal with all the information.
