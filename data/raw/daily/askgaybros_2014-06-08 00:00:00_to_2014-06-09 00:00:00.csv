I want to say i'm gay but sometimes when I see a girl I melt on the inside and have those 'butterflies'.  But I don't get turned on by lesbian porn. So I don't know if I should call myself bi? 

I don't really mind coming out at this moment but I'd rather avoid the whole explaining until they ask. I think they know because I do give small hints but I don't feel the need to come out.

That being said. I have known this guy for a couple a years now. He is very kind and kind of a bear. He is buff and I found his kind of physique to be attractive. 

We were never really close and that was because I was busy with all my other struggles. I had a friend back then who I thought was my best friend but that was because I forced it out of him. I came to realize that all of that was artificial. I also thought that I had feelings for him. But I was just so desperate for a best friend.

Fast forward to now. We are becoming quite close. We went to a bar last week with only us two and we had the best time. And we talked about how it's sometimes better to just be with two people than a whole group. 

A couple of weeks ago I slept next to him in his bed. It was no big deal and I wasn't thinking anything else about it. But when I woke up in the middle of the night I saw that he turned towards me. And then I realized how I would have this sense of 'safety' if he would just hug me. I never had a role model in my life and I am a really scared person in general. But whenever I am with him those things just seem to disappear and I just feel safe. 

I did have some thoughts about having sex with him. But it just hurts knowing that he is probably not into that. It is still possible but I don't know. 

I am just very confused if it's love that I'm feeling or if it's just that I want to be his best friend. But why would I have sexual thoughts about him then? I feel really messed up in the head.

He was cute, funny, and sweet, so after texting, we agreed to meet up. I went over to his place, and we hung out and had sex. About a week and a half later, we met up again and had a date, and had sex again. This guy's amazing. We text everyday, and we have such good synergy it's great. One day he texts me in the afternoon that he's in the hospital. He collapsed, chipped his teeth, and had his neighbor drop him off. He's there for a few days and I go visit him, and again it's great. The next day, he's released and that day he tells me the reason he was sick was that he was HIV positive and he had a spike or something and it led to him getting pretty sick in a short time. The thing is, we had unprotected sex, and the time window they gave given his viral load is within two-four weeks, and the only guys he was with were with me and a guy before we met who he got drunk and messed around with. Both times were unprotected. He could have gotten it from me or the other guy. I told him the truth, that I had had unprotected anal sex before (only with two people, repeatedly), and gotten and given blowjobs without using condoms. It was entirely possible that I had given it to him. We talked that night and we decided I'd get tested the very next day (yesterday). I went to his house, we went to the place that does free tests, they weren't open, so we walked around town for awhile, came back and got me tested. I was negative. It was one of those fast/instant tests that tests for antibodies, but because I topped him every time we had sex (which has significantly lower chances for passing, especially since the amount of the virus in his body wasn't very high at the time), and I hadn't really had sex at all the past few months, it's almost pretty much a fact that I actually am negative. I've learned my lesson, etc etc.

Now, the problem is what happens with our relationship. I like him. I'm crazy about him, and he feels the same way back. If it wasn't for this, I don't think we'd have any serious problems. We just click so well. But, I can't get over the fact that this is a huge bump in the road for us. We can never have sex without condoms, we have to be careful all the time, and it's just heavy emotionally too. I feel like this could affect every aspect of our lives if we continue. 

Anyways, what I came here for is for answer to some questions I have.

A) How do I keep myself from becoming infected if we continue our relationship? I really want to put an honest effort into making us work, but I don't think I could do so at the expense of my health. I know we use condoms and watch ourselves, but is there something I might not be aware of?

B) How do I help him when he's down? What's the right thing to say? He tells me I'm good with my words but I'm not sure if he's actually feeling better or just humoring me so I don't worry.

C) What's it like being with someone who's positive? I've heard stories of people living completely normal lives, but what's it like on a day to day person, both as someone who is positive and someone who is their partner? 

Any help would be great, bros. I really want to make this work.

I've been using a strapon dildo with him for about 3 years and we've been doing golden showers for about 5 years (he likes for me to piss while he gives me oral). I think it would be exciting to watch him actually get fucked by another guy.  My husband isn't nearly as excited about this as I am, but he's definitely on board to give it a try. 

The more I think about it, the more ideas I come up with. My husband likes to lick his cum out of me after we do anal, so I want to try eating cum out of his ass for a change, and he's agreed to try letting the guy we select piss in his mouth and says he'll swallow at least some of it if I do too.

It's risky sex to be having with a stranger, we both realize this, which is why we haven't already jumped in and done it.

Not really knowing where else to go, we've been looking over the NSA M4M and M4MW posts on Craigslist. Is there some way for us to make sure that the person we select is safe? It would really be a lousy end to our first experience of this type if one or both of us got a disease or there was some other negative outcome from the experience.

We're both committed to our relationship (married 11 years)and love each other a lot, we just want to spice things up in a big way.

Anyone here have any advice on making a safe hookup on Craigslist? Is there a better alternative? Please, and advice is welcome, but we really want to do this, so if the advice is don't bring someone else to bed, understand that we feel our marriage is strong enough to handle it.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a married woman whose husband is planning on experiencing his first time with another guy (I plan to watch and join in), and we need to know if it&amp;#39;s a mistake to try to make a connection on Craigslist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been using a strapon dildo with him for about 3 years and we&amp;#39;ve been doing golden showers for about 5 years (he likes for me to piss while he gives me oral). I think it would be exciting to watch him actually get fucked by another guy.  My husband isn&amp;#39;t nearly as excited about this as I am, but he&amp;#39;s definitely on board to give it a try. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more I think about it, the more ideas I come up with. My husband likes to lick his cum out of me after we do anal, so I want to try eating cum out of his ass for a change, and he&amp;#39;s agreed to try letting the guy we select piss in his mouth and says he&amp;#39;ll swallow at least some of it if I do too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s risky sex to be having with a stranger, we both realize this, which is why we haven&amp;#39;t already jumped in and done it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not really knowing where else to go, we&amp;#39;ve been looking over the NSA M4M and M4MW posts on Craigslist. Is there some way for us to make sure that the person we select is safe? It would really be a lousy end to our first experience of this type if one or both of us got a disease or there was some other negative outcome from the experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re both committed to our relationship (married 11 years)and love each other a lot, we just want to spice things up in a big way.&lt;/p&gt;

So I've been dating a bit an seeing a couple of guys. How do you guys gauge interest at the end if a date? I'm much more the upfront type and will just ask if they are interested in seeing each other again.

For example I am just ending a date tonight with a guy from OkCupid. I thought it went great and we seemed to enjoy each other and ended with some light making out. He seemed to enjoy his time as well. We both said that we'd like to do this again, but I've heard this so many times that it's starting to get hard to gauge genuine interest. Am I missing things or just overthinking them.

Firstly, I would like to acknowledge that this can be boiled down to me complaining about my life, which I imagine most people don't give a fuck about. Also, I come from the UK, where most people accept different sexualities. I have it MUCH easier than the people from strong conservative backgrounds where they risk being essentially abandoned by their family and friends.

**Problem:** Essentially I have three friends. One assumes I am gay, but tells me to suck a dick, and has renamed me 'gayboi' on skype, etc... Another casually drops faggot into conversation, and looks to see my reaction. For the last two years he has been trying to force me to come out.

I have drifted away from the last friend, whom I felt I could have come out to, but if I don't actively talk to/message him, he will never do the same back, and when I do.

So basically, I desperately want to come out, but I don't have anyone close to start of the process. 

I have posted about this before, and the general advice was to just *be* out. But this sounds like a crazy proposal to me for some reason. I don't want this, which has been personal to me for so long, to just seep out.. I just feel like all my options are not appropriate.

I have a grad degree and most of my interest make it difficult for me to connect even to people my own age (I like my profession, I spend free time reading books from various other fields, learning different things, following news, politics, learning history and what not). I really like myself and what I do and have no problem with that, but I'm usually more comfortable in the company of smart, educated, usually older folk as far as friendships go.

I want a relationship but I'm open to flings until the right guy comes along. The qualities I look for in a partner are things like intelligence, education, compassion, maturity, fairness, integrity, etc, and I also like that I like those things. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying he must_have_every_single_one of those things, it's just a general picture.

The problem is the physical attraction. I'm attracted mostly to twinks (usually 18-23, occasionally older) or generally guys with that body/face type. Body hair, too much muscle/weight, rugged face, etc, is all immediate turn off. And it's not that I merely *prefer* that, it's that virtually nobody else interests me physically. Not even 10s, typical ""hot"", muscular, Brad Pitt type of guys. Even when everything else is great about them and they're into me, I want to want them but I just don't feel a thing, it's like a hot woman. I want to be their friend and spend time with them, but nothing romantic.

I don't have unreasonable demands as far as physical appearance goes beyond that, though, in fact I'm much less picky than most guys (or am I?). But guys I'm attracted to and get together with never seem to have the intellectual or emotional qualities I want. And rarely anything happens to begin with because I don't click well with most of them due to combination of me being too serious and them usually being typical 20 yearolds.

I don't want any kind of asymmetric relationship in which I'm the daddy, sugar daddy, mentor or any other kind of nonsense. I want a partner, an equal. I really want a family and a normal life. But it seems what I want is unlikely to happen, and I hate it.

Now this isn't a huge issue right now since I'm still (relatively) young, but I'm worried how things are going to be for me in the future. I don't want to be dating 20 yearolds when I'm in my 30s or later. I'm worried that if I find the right guy, I might not be interested in him 10-15 years down the road and I don't want to do that to someone, specially if we start a family.
