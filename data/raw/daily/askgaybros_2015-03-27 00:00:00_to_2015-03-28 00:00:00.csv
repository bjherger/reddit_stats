..sorry for the rambling below.

I just moved out of my parents place three months ago after graduating and got a good job and feel like finally I can start my life!

I met a guy at work, my age, hot, funny and most importantly... into guys. We've been flirting and I for some reason invited him over when he said he had no plans over the weekend. 

I told him to come over on Saturday so we could hang out. o_o

I've never gone on a date, I've never dated someone.. I'm an absolute noob at those thing, I've spent my life studying. I'm excellent in bed but I have to get him into my bed to show him and I need to pass as a proper person who he would be willing to date because I really like him.

I'm going to cook for him but what should I cook, I don't want him to think I think it's a date but I still want it to be date even though we're calling it ""hanging out"". 

We've talked a lot about politics and current events but I don't think those are good topics for some down time over the weekend.

Here's what I've been imagining. 

He's coming over at three so I was thinking we'd talk a little and play some video games we've talked about, maybe watch a movie and then eat, afterwards I don't know.. mabey take a walk, although that's no very gaybro, I don't know if he would like walks.

So, I'm in my junior year of high school and lately I've just been really worried that life is passing me by and I still haven't come out yet. Maybe someone that could have been a really great relationship didn't show interest in me because I'm not out. Maybe it would have been really perfect and beautiful, but now I'll never know. Also, (here comes the clichÃ©) I have a straight crush, but the thought keeps running through my mind ""what if he isn't straight?"" What if he's just like me and hasn't come out yet and we're missing out on each other? [It reminds me of this poem.](http://edonn.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/masks.jpg) Then again, I'm not ready to come out in high school. So, I've been thinking about coming out in college, but I'm not sure how to do this. I mean, the way it sounds (""coming out"") it sounds like some big, explosive event where you burst out of a closet and there's lights and confetti and everyone knows that YOU are OUT now. You're ready to be openly gay and date guys and live your life. But it isn't like that. It's like ""Oh, hey. I'm gay."" But only that person (+ the people they tell) knows and then you have to tell everybody that you meet. So, how does one come out and just how effective is it? My immediate thought is to join some sort of GSA-ish club in college and then I'd meet people there, but even then I'm missing out on the opportunity. Also, I'm a pretty shy person and I feel like the gay community is too small to get anything done as a shy person. But I just have this image of me in my 40s all alone, maybe have dated a few people over the years, but I didn't *experience* anything. I want to have the whole thing (maybe you'd call it being a slut/whore, but that's what I want (not being a slut/whore, just experiencing life)): the sex and the love and the cuddles and heartbreak and the breakup and just all the extra stuff that no one knows about until they've had it. I just really don't want to have only one relationship and look back on what could've been. But I've never had it and I feel like I never will until I come out, and maybe not even then, and ""coming out"" just really is never a discrete event like it sounds. It's more of a lifelong from my perspective (which may be meaningless, since I'm closeted). So, I am just really lost in this sea of blah/confusion/teenagerism/being gay and need help. Upon viewing this, I've realized that it's hard to see what my actual questions are, so here they are in a nice list format:
* Am I missing out by not coming out?
* How do I come out in college?
* How do I date people (I've never dated, so the whole concept is a bit foreign to me)?
So, sorry if this is too much or I just really misunderstand life/age/relationships, but I'd really like any help that can be given. Thanks!

&lt;p&gt;(to be specific he wanted to reel it back or just be friends but I said we couldn&amp;#39;t see each other at all because I know from previous experience that I have to cut off contact to get over a guy.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m envious of the guy for dumping me. I feel like when you&amp;#39;re the one ending the relationship it gives you more control over the situation and lessens the pain. I find myself entertaining some sadistic thoughts of anticipating my first time breaking up with someone, which is awful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who have ended relationships, how does it feel from your end?&lt;/p&gt;

My boyfriend and I have been together for 3 years now, he's 26 and I'm 24. We've never had many problems, I was always happy with him and the feeling seemed mutual. Literally 15 minutes ago one of his friends (who's gay) texts me this:

""Seph I've been feeling really bad lately and I'm so so sorry. I want you to know that me and  Ryan have been sleeping together since last July and I can't keep it quiet any longer.  I'm so sorry, I feel really bad""

This guy was so nice. Always. I really liked him. Now I'm sitting here on the fucking ground crying my eyes out because I don't know what the fuck to do. My boyfriend isn't back yet and I don't think he knows I know. A minute ago I ran to start packing my stuff but I just can't and I've ended up on the ground again. The friend has texted ""Seph please reply""  about 8 times now. How the hell am I going to reply to that? And what am I going to say to the guy who I've loved for so long and actually thought I was going to marry? Fuck I can't even get up right now and he's going to come and I'm starting to feel sick to my stomach. 

I don't know what to do. I have no one to talk to. I feel like absolute shit, maybe I was completely oblivious to their relationship but i always though he loved me as much as I did. It never even crossed my mind that he'd be cheating


Update- so it wasn't a prank (I guess that was just wishful thinking). He came home not knowing anything. But he saw that I looked like a train wreck.  He looked scared, but I showed him the text and he denied it at first but then said the friend kept pressing him to cheat. I must of looked like death because he stopped arguing and kept saying ""we can fix this"". I told him to leave me alone. I have nowhere I can sleep over, so leaving for a bit is out of the question. I slept on the couch last night, I'll probably be sleeping here until I can find a place. Thanks guys, it might sound lame but I don't have anyone to vent or cry to right now, so your Internet support is very comforting.

This one Indian classmate, obviously very tipsy, hits on me *hard*. No one seems to notice, so I ignore him (I'm merrily taken), thinking it's probably just my imagination. He always claims to be straight in front of everyone, so I just shrug it off.

A couple of weeks pass, and he hits on me again, this time at a garden party. Since we are both tipsy on this occasion, I decide I can just be very blunt and blame it on the alcohol in case he flips out, and ask him (in private) if he had been hitting on me. He asks me if I'm gay, I reply that I'm bisexual. He then touches my hand and says that yes, he was indeed flirting with me. I say I'm flattered, but I'm not interested, and he replies that he's ""just having fun"".

He then proceeds to explain to me why I can never tell anyone about him, not even to our (international) classmates. He literally *begs*. Basically, he wants to go back to India, where society, including his parents, completely disapprove of homosexuality. He says that he will **never** come out and that he will just find an Indian girl to marry. I try to explain to him that he will live an empty, miserable life, that he needs to be true to himself, etc. He just nods and says that he's already considered all the options, and that he has already thought of all the things I've been telling him, but that he loves his family and his hometown too much to leave it. He also tells me that he's met plenty of Indian gay men, who are married to a woman, and that, if they can live that kind of life, so can he.

I've tried talking him out of it a couple of times after the fact, but to no avail, so I have decided to drop it (it's his choice how he wants to live his life), but I thought I would share to get some opinions. It's an odd situation, since the guy's obviously making a conscious, relatively uncoerced choice, rather than feeling like there's no other way but to hide.

Since we are both tipsy on this occasion, I decide I can just be very blunt and blame it on the alcohol in case he flips out, and ask him (in private) if he had been hitting on me. He asks me if I&amp;#39;m gay, I reply that I&amp;#39;m bisexual. He then touches my hand and says that yes, he was indeed flirting with me. I say I&amp;#39;m flattered, but I&amp;#39;m not interested, and he replies that he&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;just having fun&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He then proceeds to explain to me why I can never tell anyone about him, not even to our (international) classmates. He literally &lt;em&gt;begs&lt;/em&gt;. Basically, he wants to go back to India, where society, including his parents, completely disapprove of homosexuality. He says that he will &lt;strong&gt;never&lt;/strong&gt; come out and that he will just find an Indian girl to marry. I try to explain to him that he will live an empty, miserable life, that he needs to be true to himself, etc. He just nods and says that he&amp;#39;s already considered all the options, and that he has already thought of all the things I&amp;#39;ve been telling him, but that he loves his family and his hometown too much to leave it. He also tells me that he&amp;#39;s met plenty of Indian gay men, who are married to a woman, and that, if they can live that kind of life, so can he.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve tried talking him out of it a couple of times after the fact, but to no avail, so I have decided to drop it (it&amp;#39;s his choice how he wants to live his life), but I thought I would share to get some opinions. It&amp;#39;s an odd situation, since the guy&amp;#39;s obviously making a conscious, relatively uncoerced choice, rather than feeling like there&amp;#39;s no other way but to hide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: &lt;strong&gt;I would like to get some opinions on this person&amp;#39;s reasons/motivations in making such a choice, since it doesn&amp;#39;t make sense to me (in spite of the fact that I, too, come from a deeply homophobic country).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

So here's my situation. I'm 28, turning 29 and just recently came out to family/friends. I've been seeing a guy who is 42 for almost a full year and we really enjoy each others company/same values with similiar (not all) interests in hobbies and such. I care for him a lot and age isn't a big deal yet there is one issue we keep bumping our heads against.

With him being older, the emphasis on starting a family and getting married gets brought up pretty frequently. He's been very transparent from the start about it, yet it hasn't even been a full year yet! I want kids, I want to get married, but I still feel like we're learning about each other and don't want to rush into things too quickly. He even asked to consider moving in together, and I don't think i'm quite there yet. Today's big emotional bomb was his mom would like to have grandkids before she passes away, and I feel for the situation, but that sounded very selfish in terms of what he wants vs. us as a couple. I don't like being pressured, especially so early in the relationship. I think it's kind of unfair, and would rather take things steadily to make sure we are right for each other. 

I just don't know what to say at times, because I know there will be a point where an ultimatum will be given of ""marry me and let's start a family(or i guess proposal) or goodbye"" and i'm trying to convince him it takes time, especially from my perspective.

When we met, he was working a steady job that he hated until he could pay off his student loans and get a specific job that he would love. I've been working a no-pay crap job that gets me by and lets me just fly under the radar. He worked long hours plus overtime and we built our relationship around just being together on weekends and dating as cheaply as possible.

In the last two months, bae paid off his loans, gave notice at his old job, and almost immediately got the job of his dreams. Seeing him so happy is wonderful but I can't help but worry about the dynamic of our relationship changing since he'll be making way more money than me. He's upgrading his living situation (I'm relieved because his old neighborhood was on the rough side and I worried about him) and looking into buying a new car (a Chevy Volt, which suggests he's not going too crazy with his new status).

We held off on living together (as well as more serious legal levels of commitment) and he specifically deferred the idea for when this exact moment finally arrived. Now that it's here, I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed. I've become something of an anti-consumer as I've gotten older and I have no desire to spend his money or have him spend it on me. But I also don't want to be a buzzkill and make him feel like he can't enjoy what he's definitely earned. On top of that, I can't lie that the idea of ditching my current job and living with him (but doing literally every chore possible to earn my keep) is very tempting. Then of course, I'm worried he'll find someone ""better"" and ditch me even though I'm quite sure he won't.

I know I need to talk to him but since he's still sort of giddy and high from the recent success, he's even weepier than normal. I'm worried his clingy side might kick in and he'll tell me what I want to hear which won't solve anything. Mostly, I want to avoid letting my kneejerk insecurity trigger any of his kneejerk insecurities.

How can I approach this the right way? Should I man up and let him take the wheel? Am I worrying too much about money or not enough? Should we consider therapy?

I know this could be a bit of a sensitive issue, and I don't mean to offend anyone at all. If this might be a touchy subject for you, please don't feel obligated to answer.  

However, I feel alot of us in the gay community may not even know what to look out for. I've done alot of googling over time (I'm a slight hypochondriac) and all the answers are pretty generic. I know everyone is different and everyone's body has a different way of reacting. 

I was just curious as to what are some of your's (or someone you know who is HIV+)'s bodily reactions and symptoms when they got infected. 

Of course protecting yourself and getting tested regularly is a given, but recognizing the symptoms early on and being aware could save someone's life.

I&amp;#39;ve done alot of googling over time (I&amp;#39;m a slight hypochondriac) and all the answers are pretty generic. I know everyone is different and everyone&amp;#39;s body has a different way of reacting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was just curious as to what are some of your&amp;#39;s (or someone you know who is HIV+)&amp;#39;s bodily reactions and symptoms when they got infected. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course protecting yourself and getting tested regularly is a given, but recognizing the symptoms early on and being aware could save someone&amp;#39;s life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks!  &lt;/p&gt;

I've been seeing this guy since August, and I'm totally in love with him - we connect on every damn level.  However sexually we've had to put a lot of effort in to make it work.  I consider myself a bottom, he considers himself 100% vers.  From the get-go we had some issues, as I found out he has problems keeping it up when he tops.  But we've made strides, ditched condoms (after getting tested), he got Cialis, and now it works.  He's also super vanilla in bed which is fine, however I have a bit more of an adventurous side that never gets explored.  Thing I've suggested, like using handcuffs, or rimming, or blindfolds, he's either dismissed or it never happens.  So I let it go.

I am very aware that he's vers, and that obviously he's going to want the D, and I'm super open to giving it to him.  We went to a sex store and he bought a little butt plug for us to use on him which I've been excited about.  I've never topped before, but I'm more than happy to do it for him to please my man.  I've told him this many times, and recently have tried initiating - but I get shut down.  He's not ready, or it's been a long time, or he's not clean.  It is what it is.

My concern, and it's not really a concern I guess just something that bums me out, is that when we talk about our sexual history and sexual encounters, he talks about how he has mostly bottomed, and the guy he was casually hooking up with before me he was bottoming for, and I found out he has handcuffs and blindfolds cause he was hooking up with a guy that liked to use them, and the other night he told me about a guy that used to like getting choked and he used to do that.  He also went with his ex to a bathhouse once and said he loved it cause he's into exhibitionist stuff, but so far has never done anything like that with me.  All these things that I've said I'd want to try, and he's done, but doesn't do with me.  

I also asked him the other night if he's used the butt plug and he said he has a couple times, which bums me out cause I wanted to use it with him.

So how do I get him to open up a little bit?  We've come such a long way sexually but I feel like there's still a ways to go.  Am I being too selfish?  Help me out bros.

TL;DR:  My boyfriend has a history of being somewhat sexually adventurous but isn't adventurous at all with me even though I want to be.

He's really cool people, and we share some similar experiences with each other; however, I don't even know if he's gay or not so I decided to talk to one of my friends about him. He was asking for pictures of him so he could make his assessments as well as other things like ""does he have more girl friends, or guy friends"", ""does he have pictures of girls"" and so on and so forth. After the conversation he came to the conclusion that he was gay (due to the fact that he took a selfie wearing a well put together outfit finished with suspenders and doesn't really have pictures of women but has female friends) but I don't even know what to think. I know that my friend lives in New York, works in PR, and communicates with people almost effortlessly and always, so the things he picks up on may actually have some truth to it, but I am still skeptical that he is able to read someone like that and come to that conclusion which sorta leads to my question if there are traits that hold some merit in terms of being gay, closeted, bisexual.

I am still in the closet myself and I know that when it comes to talking about relationships I'm gender neutral in my wording. It's kind of my way to throw people off (a really bad way) but I don't know if that's a shared trait with other closeted men. If anything I think they would talk about women more or kinda dodge around those questions which is what I sometimes do without thinking. Do some of these things hold merit?
