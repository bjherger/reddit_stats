Cutting to the chase, I learn he actually fucks this guy a lot. I'm insanely jealous because I think that guy is pretty hot too. But the real reason is the I'm in love with this dude. I don't want to hook up with anyone but him. I know his stance on relationships and that's not one right now or until he finds the ""right"" person, presumably a girl (he's bi).

I feel sick thinking about him with all these dudes. Yet I've fucked more guys than him and he doesn't mind. I understand it's jealousy, but it's just sex we're having.

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not so much about being gay as it is not being able to live my life like I want to. I want a wife and kids when I&amp;#39;m older. It&amp;#39;s not because that&amp;#39;s how I was raised to think, I legitimately want a traditional family. So first question: do any of you guys want that too? Did any of you want that originally and then just kind of forget about it? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m know it&amp;#39;s not a choice who you&amp;#39;re ultimately attracted to, but lately it&amp;#39;s been hard to figure out which one I like better. So for any of you guys who&amp;#39;ve had sex with both men and women, did you feel anything when you had sex with women? I get hard for my girlfriend, it&amp;#39;s just hard for me to finish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any advice, insight?&lt;/p&gt;

Chatted with a few guys but nothing too serious. Then I talked to this one guy and we seemed really into each other. After a day we made plans to meet up at his place but at the last second he couldn't host anymore (lives with his parents).

We talked on the phone for a few minutes and then began texting. We texted everyday for about a week. He seemed SUPER into me. He told me how attracted he was to me, but also how much he just liked chatting with me. He said he was so glad we were talking and that he was sooo excited to meet up in person.
He even asked about where I go to college, and when I told him he said that he was wicked happy that it wasn't too far away because I could visit him.

We made plans to meet up another day but he was hungover and we decided we'd rather wait for a day when he's feeling more himself.

We planned to meet up last weekend (Saturday) and on Friday he just stops responding to my texts randomly.
He didn't log into Grindr for all of Memorial Day weekend which was odd (he usually goes on about once or twice a day). This made me think that he might have left his phone at work by accident, and therefore could not text me.
Sure enough, on Tuesday he does go on Grindr but still no responses to my texts. On Wednesday I message him on Grindr and ask what's up...no response.

Yesterday I sent one last message on Grindr saying that its ok if he's not interested anymore but to please just let me know so that I can move on.

Today, I checked Grindr and he doesn't show up and our chat log is gone so I'm assuming he blocked me.

Why would a guy say so many nice things about enjoying talking to me and looking forward to meeting with me and then cut off all communication?!
He wasn't just ""trying to get into my pants"" because I was more than willing to hookup with him from the get-go and he knew that!!

I also don't think I was being too clingy/annoying because he would often initiate our conversations and tell me to text him the next day etc.

I'm sad because I really liked him and was so looking forward to meeting and I just don't understand what happened :/

Also I know this is pathetic but is there any chance his phone was lost/stolen? Maybe he didn't block me on grindr he just deleted his account??? He didn't have my number written down anywhere so if he lost his phone he wouldn't have any way to contact me...","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I downloaded grindr for the first time a few weeks ago.

I've known the guy since before I even started classes my first year at a university. We were both in the same section in band, and we connected pretty quickly. I'd hang out with him on a regular basis and drink and play video games and just have a good time. He also told me he is bipolar, but I never really noticed anything wrong other than he is sometimes really hyper and likes to invade everyone's personal space and be creepy, but then another day he'd be a lot calmer, and sometimes a little depressed, but he never seemed to be in a horribly bad mood. I do know that he has gotten very sensitive and angry all of a sudden at times when something is said, but I know some of his stories he's shared about his past, and understand where the frustration comes from when it does happen.

We also shared a lot of mutual friends that would come over to his place and hang out/party. Before I told anyone I was gay, I slept in a chair in his living room and he slept on the couch across from me. I was still slightly awake and felt his hand going up the leg of my shorts. I subtley closed off access tightly to my crotch so he didn't know I had a semi-boner. I didn't know if he was just trying to be his usual creepy self, or if he actually wanted to feel me up, but he stopped and went to sleep on the couch. I didn't come out to anyone until a few months later, when I drunkenly blabbered to his girlfriend at the time that I was gay, and then proceeded to pass out on his couch. His girlfriend told him what I said, and he was fine with it. He even told me then that he kissed a guy once (but I don't know if it was a serious kiss or jokingly).

I continued to hang out with him regularly. If he wanted me to come over and hang out, I was always there. I'm an introvert and have a hard time making friends, so the fact that he wanted me to come over all the time made me feel comfortable, even though he was more extraverted and social than me.

About a year and a half later, he asked me if I wanted to share an apartment and I said sure, and we lived together for 2 years. To be honest, I found him attractive since he first put his hand up my shorts, but I set up a boundary with him that I refused to cross no matter what while we were living together. I never tried to ""flirt"" back with him because I didn't want anything ""weird"" to happen while we were living together. 

While living together, he was still his usual, bubble-invading self. He'd sometimes come into my room wearing nothing but loose boxers while I'm just laying on my bed browsing the internet and he'd just lay on top of me or wrestle me until I fall out of the bed. He was always very physical about it and liked to try and grope me to make me uncomfortable.  I never really fought back too much, because I kind of liked it, even I did get a few small bruises, but I didn't want to reciprocate because of that mental boundary I set up. He would also ask me often if I wanted to suck his dick. I did, but the answer I always gave was a shy ""noooo..."" or I'd tell him that one of our other straight friends would do it, jokingly. He'd also sometimes flash his ass while passing by my room ask if I like that, and I'd just act a little disgusted and give him a dirty look. Once, he also slapped his dick on my shoulder a few times when I wasn't looking and then he put it away, smirked and laughed a little, and went up to his room. When he did that, my jaw just dropped as a looked at him with the smirk on his face. I had been holding back for so long, and at that point, I seriously thought about not holding back (we were only living together for a few more months anyway) and try touching him a little inappropriately like he does to me to see how he reacted, but in the end I just didn't do anything. 

Also while living together, we drank together pretty often and just played some video games and talked. One night....I don't remember how exactly this happened....but he said ""I think I might be gay."". My memory isn't the best (might even be a false memory or a dream, but I'm 95% sure this actually happened), but I think I remember saying ""No you're not""...and that was about as far as the conversation went. I got nervous and felt like I pushed him away a little due to the boundaries I set between us. I haven't talked to him about it because I'm not 100% sure I actually heard it, or if he remembers it, but I've always had a feeling that he is bisexual. I also remember one night he asked if I could deepthroat (not him, just in general), and I just nervously responded no because I was afraid of where the conversation was headed (for the record, I can, but not excessively lol). He had also sent me a facebook message the first year we started living together that just said ""What do you think of me 757?"". I ignored it, because I wasn't sure if he wanted me to say I liked him or what (and didn't know what the 757 part meant)...but I was assuming that, and I wasn't going to let my straight roommate know that I liked him unless I knew he thought the same way.

After moving out, my feelings for him have just grown more. I still see him once every few months, and each time we see each other it just seems like there is something more between us after I moved away. I remember sitting on the couch at a mutual friend's place watching a movie after partying all night and he put his legs across my lap the whole time and I just rested my hands on them and very, very, slightly moved my fingers across them (like a millimeter or 2 lol), and it felt kind of intimate to me. I would have probably asked him some personal questions that next morning if our friends hadn't woken up 5 minutes after we did. Another time we saw each other, he found a crappy ring on the floor while we were cleaning and fake proposed to me and I just shook my head, smiled, and chuckled a little. But it got me thinking that maybe he does like me. There always seems to be a little truth behind our jokes.

The last time we saw each other, there were about 20 others who we both knew also. I tried to pay more attention to his body language, without trying to look like I was creeping on him (peripheral vision ftw). I was sitting outside on the deck alone smoking my e-cig and sipping a beer while he was inside, and noticed him glancing outside at me a few times. I'd look make eye contact with him for a split second and he'd look away, then he eventually came outside and we just talked alone for a while about whatever and sip on some beer. Later in the night, we were the last two still up after he was teaching me how to play a video game I've never played before, but instead of sleeping in the living room with him, I put up my mental barrier again and I decided to sleep in the spare bed with a mutual straight friend as ""payback"" for the time he came up to my room drunk and passed out next to me in my bed, just to creep him out (cause he sure creeped me out walking into my room and collapsing into the bed next to me). The next morning we had breakfast, he quickly kissed me on the cheek at some point as I blushed, and then we eventually went our separate ways.

Well, now I'm going to be visiting him in about a week before heading to a mutual friend's wedding. I'm getting up there a day early though to do our usual thing of just hanging out, drinking some beers, and ""getting stupid"" as he puts it. It doesn't matter how drunk I get, I'm not going to physically try and make a move on him because I'm still not sure what he thinks about me, but all these little things just make me think he might like me too, but is afraid to admit it, and I feel like maybe we are just stuck in a stalemate. I'd really like to know what he really thinks, but I don't know how to bring it up in a ""bro to bro"" kind of way, and don't want to make it awkward. 

Even if I'm dead wrong about him liking me, I kind of still want to know what he was thinking when he said some of the things he said. Any advice on how to bring this up?

I&amp;#39;m getting up there a day early though to do our usual thing of just hanging out, drinking some beers, and &amp;quot;getting stupid&amp;quot; as he puts it. It doesn&amp;#39;t matter how drunk I get, I&amp;#39;m not going to physically try and make a move on him because I&amp;#39;m still not sure what he thinks about me, but all these little things just make me think he might like me too, but is afraid to admit it, and I feel like maybe we are just stuck in a stalemate. I&amp;#39;d really like to know what he really thinks, but I don&amp;#39;t know how to bring it up in a &amp;quot;bro to bro&amp;quot; kind of way, and don&amp;#39;t want to make it awkward. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if I&amp;#39;m dead wrong about him liking me, I kind of still want to know what he was thinking when he said some of the things he said. Any advice on how to bring this up? &lt;/p&gt;

also had videos online where he ranted about rejection and women.

The thing is I notice sometimes guys on here rant about rejection and seem to hate other gay men cause their always getting rejected and feel very lonely.

I just wondering if a crazy gay guy would do something like that.
I would hope not.

Honestly, I feel kind of weird asking some random internet strangers for advice, but I hope your objective POV (hehe) helps me see stuff in a different light.

So, I've been in a committed relationship for 4 years with a really nice guy. We've actually lived together for some time and things are going pretty well. We're both living in different countries, but since we're only 3 hours apart by train that hasn't really been a problem. 

Thing is, I was really young when we got together. I was 16 and he was 20. My whole life out of the closet I've been in a relationship and lately I've been getting more curious what it's like to go on dates, feel the excitement/nervosity of having one night stands and all the other stuff young gay men usually do. I feel this relationship has been very good for me, but it's time I break it off to explore the world a bit more. Besides, our personalities are quite different. We do complement each other in a way but I think we could both be happier with someone that's more compatible to our own personalities (he's more of a gamer and he's very romantic whereas I'm more of an outdoors-y type and I don't really care much for the 'typical' romantic stuff). 

So, I've sort of come to the conclusion that I'm ready to end this relationship. Thing is, he's still madly in love with me. He keeps texting me how much he misses me and that he can't wait for my next visit. I still care deeply for him so I really do NOT want to make this a messy break up. My question is; how do I go about this? Do I sit him down for a conversation next time I visit him? He won't expect anything and he's planning all these activities for us to do.. Or should I skype with him and tell him I need to talk about something serious when I'm there so he might get the hint? 

GUYS! Give me some pointers, tips , hints anything. From movies and the like I sort of know what it's like to be broken up with, but how the hell do you break up with someone without ruining a shot at friendship later down the road? 

Any help is greatly appreciated :)

edit:  HI! Ok so it's been a while and I've been thinking about it non-stop. I'm visiting him this friday and that's when I'll have to make my decision. I just told him I needed to talk and we skyped for a while. I told him that I'm not sure where I want this relationship to go (or IF I want this relationship to last, for that matter) and he took it like a champ. He was very mature about it and told me that if I don't feel it anymore I shouldn't fool either one of us. Thing is, at the end he started crying and I could tell he's heartbroken by the news. I told him we'll talk again on Friday and that I need some time to think about it (obviously not breaking up over skype) and that I hope he'll take some time to think about it as well. His response: I don't need to think about  it, I don't want us to break up. Then he started crying and he closed the skype convo. Now I'm sitting here and I feel like crap because I can tell he's still in love with me and it just sucks when you don't love someone back. Im not even sure I dont love him anymore.. maybe these are normal feelings after a 4 yr relationship? Ugh , I guess I'm not asking you guys anything this time, just needed some place to vent.
