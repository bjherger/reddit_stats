(Edit: sorry I tried.)

So I am 23 y/o and started a new job in the construction industry several months ago. This other guy started on the same day as me for basically the same job but on a different project. We got put in the same office and we bonded over a lot of stuff work-related stuff. We also started going out to get lunch together every day. Eventually I got moved to an office across town (but still within walking distance) and we decided to keep getting lunch together so we did that for a while and we would just chat about whatever. Based on the way he talked about women, it made me question his sexuality a little but at the same time he would also talk about finding a wife and having a bunch of kids. So I was always unsure. I wasn't really out at work. I mean if someone asked me I would tell them the truth but a job in construction isn't really the place to go around flaunting your sexuality. So I kinda left it an untouched topic for me. There were a few times when it was just me and him that I dropped a hint here or there and I wasnt sure if he picked up on them but he seemed to. We quickly developed a pretty good friendship though and I was glad to have a friend because the majority of my high school or college friends live in other states and I dont always have the easiest time making new friends.

Anyway, so after a few months he started looking for a new job with a shorter commute and a less-cranky project manager. He got hired at a new job almost an hour away. We went out and grabbed dinner after his last day of work. When he was leaving we both said that we wanted to keep in touch, etc etc. I wanted to tell him that I'm gay just to get it out there but I didn't want to overshadow his achievement of getting a new job. 

We kept in touch via text for a few weeks. Met up at a bar with some of his friends. Nothing too crazy. I told him I wanted to go to the NY Auto Show so we met up and went to that together. At the show there were all these models standing near the cars and we were walking around and chatting and he mentioned something about one of the models being cute and I was just like ""ehh she's not really my type"" and he was like ""Oh, so what is your type?"" And I said ""Honestly...... uhh...... guys."" and he was like ""Oh.... thats cool. No judgement here, etc."" so we kinda just carried on talking about cars. Later on we went to his friend's apartment nearby and were drinking some beers on the roof. And he said to me ""Hey man thanks for telling me and everything. I appreciate that you trust me. I mean, I don't really like labels or anything but I dont really discriminate when it comes to genders."" Then his friend showed up again and re-joined our conversation so that kinda put a stop to his side of the conversation. Apparently (He told me afterwards) that his good friend doesnt know this and that I am pretty much the first person he has told that. Nothing else really eventful happened after that. We carried on texting and he told me that he wanted to hang out and pick my brain. So we made plans to go hiking this past weekend. I also wanted to see the new Spider-Man movie and he is really into comic books and such so I asked him if he wanted to go and he said yeah and bought tickets for last Friday night's showing. So we met up at the movies and it kinda sorta almost felt like a date. But at the same time it totally didnt. After the movie we ended up sitting in comfy armchairs outside the theater and we just kinda sat there and talked. About the movie about funny shit we did when we were kids. Basically just talking and before we knew it two hours had gone by and they were closing the theater. He drove me back to my car since I had parked on the opposite side of the mall and in the car he kinda confessed some of his insecurities about his physical appearance. (Again some things he had never shared with anyone else). 

Anyway so cut to the hike in the woods that we went on yesterday. it was a really nice hike even though the weather was a little gray. But he had a bunch of questions for me about how I figured out I was gay and things like that. And I was happy to share it with him. It felt good to talk about it. Being so open about myself is kinda new to me (Ive been out to a bunch of friends for almost 2 years but only told my family about a month ago). I told him about my first experience with a guy. (My friend/roommate who I was into but who wasnt into me. I think he was just kinda experimenting and decided he wasnt into it. It basically ruined our friendship) Then I told him about how the first person who I came out to was my current best friend (a girl) and how she was into me for about a year and then tried to kiss me and I had to tell her I was gay. (This situation also got messy. I am really like a Kinsey 5 and we ended up sleeping together after I came out to her. We had a good time and shared a lot with each other in bed. i really felt connected to her but obviously was not in love with her. So I ended it. It got messy. Her feelings were hurt. I regretted starting anything in the first place. But eventually we came out of it with a stronger friendship.) I know. I'm a mess. 

Anyway. He told me personal things too about his past and how he had done some light experimentation. And how he wanted to find a way to experiment further to find out if he was more into guys than girls or what he wants. He has very little experience (though I dont really have that much either). We went for a drive after the hike and he told me about how he doesnt feel the need to share his orientation with his family. Its his business, not theirs, and if he ends up dating a guy then they can just meet him and put the pieces together. He also told me he thinks he leans more toward guys. 

Then further on in our drive he got kinda nervous and said to me ""So about me finding someone to help me figure myself out. I was thinking maybe that person could be you. I mean, I trust you. I'm not trying to put pressure on you or anything"" and I was kinda speechless, but not because it was unexpected. I had kinda felt our friendship heading in this direction. But I am very conflicted. On one hand, I am pretty sure I am developing feelings for him. But I really don't want to lose him as a friend if it doesn't work out. Also, the way he said it was kinda all-business let me figure myself out kinda deal and I think I am looking for more than that. I've never been in a relationship with a guy. But I want to be. The thing I am most concerned about is it ruining our friendship. I have slept with two good friends and one time it ended really badly and the other time it made our friendship 100x better. I just don't know which way this will go and that scares me a little.

After he got home he texted me and apologized for putting me on the spot like that and said he felt like a fool. I told him not to be embarrassed and I understood where he was coming from and how I had had a difficult time figuring myself out too. I also let him know that I am not oppossed to the idea but I would rather take things a little slower and see where it goes. It really does feel like we are headed in that direction but I would kinda prefer it to develop organically than to try to force it before we are both ready. 

I'm not sure I'm making sense anymore and this post is now waaaay longer than I had intended. If you've made it this far, Thank you for reading. I really do appreciate you all and this community. :)

 Basically, I don't know what to do. The best I can come up with at this point is to keep hanging out and see where things go. 

Can anyone offer any advice? Have any of you been in similar situations? What would you do if you were me? HELP!

**EDIT/UPDATE:** Thank you all for taking the time to read this. It really has helped me to read all your advice and words of encouragement. Basically we were texting back and forth all day and he asked if I wanted to go to a comedy show next week and I said yes. I am planning on talking to him then about where we are going. Based on the flirty texts he sent me today I think we are on the same page :) Again, thanks for taking the time to read this and respond. you guys are great!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, I will try to keep this as brief as possible.

I'm in my senior year... He's a sophomore. I'm graduating next week, but employed with my College for two years (alumni ARE in the clear to be dating students, if the relationship was pre-existing). 

This has been the best relationship I've ever had. I was mentally over dating. My first relationship turned into a 4 year ""complicated"" situation, and nothing else was taking off, and I was becoming jaded. I told myself I would wait until after graduation to try again... but I guess we don't always get a say in when a relationship pops up. He's been AMAZING. Time flies whenever I'm with him. The last month has felt like a dream. 

He left campus four days ago. Things aren't boring or slowing down yet, but I'm sure they will, and I'm looking for suggestions to sort of counteract that. We only have to make it to August... But on the other hand... We have to make it to August. Luckily, neither one of us is really the active type when it comes to searching for a relationship. We're both very much the type that's content to find the one we like and then just hold on. So I'm not really worried about being tempted with infidelity on either side.

I'm a 24 year old grad student. I have only recently come to terms with my sexuality and earlier this year I made a profile on adam4adam. After weeding through a lot of creepy dudes I found one guy who seemed nice and was really hot. He was kinda small and muscular with a great ass- just my type. He was on the outs with his bf and came over and gave me a great blowjob- my first from a guy. He contacted me a few days later and told me he got back together with his bf so I figured there would be no round two.

Since then I've hooked up with a few more guys on grindr, but only had sex once, and it was a bad experience for a lot of reasons that I won't go into for the sake of time. About a week ago I drunkenly messaged the first guy and told him to text me if he was single. Tonight he texted me and said he wanted me to come over sometime this week and go ""all the way"" this time.

The problem is that he's still with his boyfriend and he says they're doing well, but apparently he likes my dick and wanted to come over one more time before he leaves town for the summer. He said he and his bf have had threesomes but they don't have an open relationship or anything, so it would basically be cheating, which I'm not cool with. But I'm really attracted to him. I haven't found many good guys on grindr and I'm dying to have more fun with him. Still, I don't feel totally comfortable helping a guy cheat and I'm terrified of what would happen if the bf found out. What would you do in my situation?

TL:DR A guy that I'm dying to have sex with wants to have sex with me but he has a boyfriend, and I'm having a moral crisis.

So, I met this guy on Grindr while spending a weekend at my friends house in Boston. I live and worked in the area but went into the city sometimes to escape the suburbs. Okay so we hit it off on grindr, had been talking for about two weeks, I give him my number then delete grindr (I'm a flip flopper). I get a text from a new number and guess who! the guy from grindr. Yknow what, let's call him Dylan, thatll be easier.

Dylan and I text for a few days and he asks me to go to this fancy place in Boston. We chat for hours, get two bottles of wine (!), end up going to another fancy place for part two and just click with every sentence. He and I are having an amazing date, we both agreed it was refreshing to meet someone who's a ""good"" guy these days. All I can say is that we had a magical night. Ended respectfully without a kiss.

I head back to my friends place and he's in bed, so I just float on cloud nine to the couch after getting several sweet texts from Dylan. He actually asked me out for another date three days later up where I live. I said yes, clearly. Having another amazing date? Sure, I'll take one of those.

We chat non stop until the next date and end up watching a movie, then grabbing dinner, then I took him to one of my favorite spots to play when I was a kid. It just happened to be the night time...wink wink. We checked out the field, then made out for a solid 90 minutes. Pure Heaven, again, we both agreed.

So here's the kicker, I moved to NYC two days later. I know, right? I wait two years since my last bf to meet an amazing guy who gives me butterflies AND I LEAVE THE STATE 48 HOURS LATER. 

I move, we text, call, snapchat, facetime all day still. we just are falling for each other hard and I couldn't be happier. I was afraid NYC would eat me alive, but Dylan's texts and calls made everything all right. We keep flirting and come to the realization that he should come down and visit when my roommates gone to Europe for a bit. He did. Then it got strange.

The weekend was amazing, we spent every moment we could together, making jokes, being cute and shit, trying to make the weekend memorable. There was one point where he got in his own head and that kinda set him off into a blue mood but he bounced back and he took me to Brooklyn to meet one of his good high school friends.

**The reason why I know something's up with him is because of the way he squeezed me when he held me, the way he kissed my forehead when we watched tv, how he cuddled me at night, I could really tell he felt something for me because of his body language, it was undeniable and he wasn't trying to hide it.**


Sunday afternoon, I wait with him at the bus stop for the late megabus. He gives me one final hug and squeezes me as if he doesn't want to let go. He jumps on the bus and away he goes. I get a few cute snaps from him moments later, and then it went all silent.

All of Monday, I heard nothing from him, so I text him to ask him how his day is. Things roll like they normally do. The next day its the same story, but I call him out on it. No texts or anything until the end of day and when I ask him what's up. I raised the question of how he's doing, like are you okay? No response. The next day on wednesday, I say I want to chat about this over the phone. I've never seen you like this and I want to know why he's withdrawing. We have a semi constructive phone call with me reassuring that the distance won't kill us, we'll make it work. All that good stuff. THe call ends with a not so convincing ""I'll stick around longer""

Thursday, we kinda had a normal day, maybe me prodding the convo a bit to keep it going. Friday, weird. So I call him again and tell him that I'm not convinced from that last call, I need to know why you're resisting and acting so fucking shady. I asked if it was another guy, if I said something that offended him, if it was the distance...It wasn't another guy and I didn't say anything offensive. He's not feeling all the commotion of traveling just to see someone for a weekend. I told him how my sister met her bf in NYC then he went back to Greece for like six months and now is in London. They make distance work so well, so I'm convinced that I can make it work too. I care so much for him and I know he does for me, we have it inside ourselves to make this work.

He told me he didn't think he was ready for a relationship, he wanted to put effort into something closer, he said that he thought the fact I don't like spicy food or roller coasters was too big of a difference...he said all of these things without confidence and his excuses ended up not adding up. They walked over each other and nothing made sense all in all. IN the end, the second phone call didn't really make anything clearer; i poured my soul into the call and trying to prove to him that what we have is rare and that we really should make this work to create a source of happiness and joy for ourselves. He told me I was selling all this so well and making it so hard for him to resist, but alas, still in some weird limbo. We ended the call sort of saying let's go back to being our flirty selves and chat like we were friends; let's leave the door open for down the road once we get to know each other more.


Sorry this is rambling on. I find it therapeutic to write it all down and it helps me to hear constructive responses. It may sound jambled and weird, but what Dylan and I have is fucking worth it. It's all so fast and recent and I'm still confused and it makes me sad that someone this amazing is slipping away from me and idk why or how to stop it. I don't feel like this often, the last time was the end of 2011.

Any advice?

He randomly starts sending suggestive/flirty messages to someone I introduced him to and embarrassed me to some of my friends. He's been super apologetic and I think he does truly regret it. I have plans to hang out w/ him w/ a group this weekend. How do you think I should handle it?


I've been seeing this guy for a few weeks now. We aren't dating but we've been seeing each other and talking a lot and our relationship was on that path. We fooled around a little bit last weekend and we have plans to go to an event all weekend together (and w/ some friends) this upcoming weekend.

Yesterday, a friend told me that the guy I've been seeing randomly started drunk texting her boyfriend (Who is bi). She told me the texts were really flirtatious and he was clearly drunk and going for it. The weird thing is that he was/is out of town, so even if the boyfriend wanted to it wasn't gonna happen.

It came out a day or two later, he was actually the first one to bring it up. He's apologized up and down a million ways and I do believe that he's as sorry as he says he is but I just don't understand why he did it? I told him that I didn't understand and he said he didn't either, that he was drunk, that it was scummy of him and, he regrets it so much etc.

I'm not mad at him for exploring other options, we aren't dating and if he meets the man of his dreams then he should definitely go for it. But I am upset because it just feels kind of insulting and rude to me. I introduced him to the boyfriend he hit on and I'm good friends with the boyfriend and girlfriend. There is absolutely no way he could have thought it wouldn't get back around to me almost immediately. It makes me look like an idiot because in the last couple weeks I have ditched these friends a few times specifically because I have had plans with this guy, most of my friends know that I am pursuing him. So idk I just feel a little embarrassed because if it I guess. 

I don't really know how to proceed forward from here. I told him I wasn't mad that he hit on the boyfriend, that he should do whatever makes him happiest, but that I was just a little confused because I thought we had something going. He said he didn't know what he wanted but that he really liked being with me and wanted to see where it went. That he regretted how he acted and wanted things between us to go back to how it was originally. He still wants me to come this weekend, one of the days is his birthday and I am friends with several other people in the group.

How should I proceed going forward? It's not like we're dating or that he cheated on me. I don't think if I found out somehow that he did the same thing to someone I don't know I would be upset about it. I realize he didn't really do anything, but it's just the fact that he did it to my friend who would obviously tell me. It was just not what I expected from him at all, I still like him a lot but this has certainly lowered my opinion of him and reminded me I don't know him that well.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;TLDR - I&amp;#39;ve been seeing a guy for a few weeks and we seemed to be on the path to some sort of relationship.

I told him that I didn&amp;#39;t understand and he said he didn&amp;#39;t either, that he was drunk, that it was scummy of him and, he regrets it so much etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not mad at him for exploring other options, we aren&amp;#39;t dating and if he meets the man of his dreams then he should definitely go for it. But I am upset because it just feels kind of insulting and rude to me. I introduced him to the boyfriend he hit on and I&amp;#39;m good friends with the boyfriend and girlfriend. There is absolutely no way he could have thought it wouldn&amp;#39;t get back around to me almost immediately. It makes me look like an idiot because in the last couple weeks I have ditched these friends a few times specifically because I have had plans with this guy, most of my friends know that I am pursuing him. So idk I just feel a little embarrassed because if it I guess. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t really know how to proceed forward from here. I told him I wasn&amp;#39;t mad that he hit on the boyfriend, that he should do whatever makes him happiest, but that I was just a little confused because I thought we had something going. He said he didn&amp;#39;t know what he wanted but that he really liked being with me and wanted to see where it went. That he regretted how he acted and wanted things between us to go back to how it was originally. He still wants me to come this weekend, one of the days is his birthday and I am friends with several other people in the group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How should I proceed going forward? It&amp;#39;s not like we&amp;#39;re dating or that he cheated on me. I don&amp;#39;t think if I found out somehow that he did the same thing to someone I don&amp;#39;t know I would be upset about it. I realize he didn&amp;#39;t really do anything, but it&amp;#39;s just the fact that he did it to my friend who would obviously tell me. It was just not what I expected from him at all, I still like him a lot but this has certainly lowered my opinion of him and reminded me I don&amp;#39;t know him that well.&lt;/p&gt;

Long time lurker, first time poster here. I've got myself into a doozy with a guy situation. Sorry beforehand if this takes a bit time to read through.

A bit about me: I'm 19, in university, and out. I've never had a relationship or even close to one - been on a total of 2 dates in my life. Everything virgin - never even kissed anyone. I consider myself decent looking, I work out and keep fit, and am pretty outgoing. I'm on OKC, grindr etc etc, so it's not like I hermit either. I just don't get many messages on any of the sites above, not really sure why :/ 

The Story:
So one night, someone messages me on OKC, and I replied to him (I reply to all messages out of courtesy, unless of course the other person is super vulgar or obviously looking for NSA hookups). I see that we are 95% compatible on OKC, and after exchanging messages for around a week, exam season hit. We were having real conversations and a really good connection, and my last message to him ended with a question asking if he was going back to his hometown for the summer. During exam season, he didn't reply to me at all, nor did he log onto OKC, which I totally understand. However, one night after my last exam, I went out to a bar, and I saw him there dancing with his friends - it's my first time seeing him in person. He didn't notice me until when I saw him at the bar and went up to him. I looked at him in the eye and was about to say something, then he looked away and walked away. I'm guessing that either he: 1) Didn't recognize me in his drunkenness, or 2) This just means I don't have a chance with him anymore. 

I don't really know what to do at this point. He hasn't logged onto OKC at all since around a month ago. He's exactly my type, in appearance and personality, we go to the same university, and have a bunch of mutual friends. I kind of want to message him on Facebook (we told each other our real names, but didn't add each other yet on facebook), but I don't want to seem creepy/clingy. 

Can y'all help me out a bit here with my dilemma?

I am 20 a male and I need some help.

Recently, I moved into another country, began studying, working and so on. I have no experience in dating, but I met this guy, who is very nice and I would like to get to know him better, go out with him to see if he is interested in me. The thing is that I am not openly gay, since I don't like to flaunt it in public or telling it to everyone I meet. If someone asks, I mostly tell them.

Also, I am not even sure if he's gay as well, since we only spoke 3 times (he's my classmate's former high-school classmate) and we chatted on Facebook (he didn't reply to my last messages, IDK if it's because he finds me boring or because the conversation simply didn't lead anywhere).

We were fooling around once at school and I made a GIF of a sequence of pics I found on my friend's laptop and put it onto his wall with this being his response: ""I see.. you have been looking at my pics.. :) :)"" and ""I miss you too!"".

I am really insecure about this and I would love to hang out with him more, but our mutual friend doesn't really go out that often for private reasons and I don't know if it isn't weird to just call a guy out out of the blue. Even if I did, I am afraid he would not like me or would not be interested and would not react very well. Also, if I got the balls to call him out, what is the ideal thing to do, where to go? Note this would not be a date in that sense, since I don't want to raise my expectations too high but then there's this: what if? 

Then there's another thing I'm worried about. What are we going to talk about, even if he says yes? I am very bad at talking to people at first and getting comfortable around strangers... I am afraid that we would not have anything to discuss and it would be boring...

&lt;p&gt;For instance: gooms&amp;#39; suits, best men, the ceremony itself (who&amp;#39;s the one who&amp;#39;s waiting for the other? Is there even one who waits (typical groom waiting for the bride thing) or do we avoid this situation and how?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the little things like the cake, the decoration... I really don&amp;#39;t know what could be changed and how do we do it so, has anyone attended to a gay wedding or is married himself and can show us some light in the subject?&lt;/p&gt;

I decided to say ""yes"" to his proposal but a few conditions.

1) I want to have a long engagement. Maybe two years. He agree to it.

I never vacation or really get out and I want to have more fun this summer and of course always being single I wouldn't mind actually meeting and talking to a guy or two as well.

I love beaches and warm, sunny weather so I am wondering what would be some fun places to go where there's a lot of fun, younger people with a good mix of gay and straight even. Basically, kind of like a spring break type destination, but not as crazy and with maybe more younger professional crowd (I'll be 26 this month) instead of college freshman.

I know I'm rambling, but basically I am looking for the following:

* Beach with warm water/weather, lots of sun and people where I can enjoy the view ;) and just relax with a book or something.

* Frequented by a younger crowd (under 30)

* Possibility of being around a decent proportion of gay men, whether it's just meeting people as friends or maybe having a little (safe) fun.

* Probably nothing like a nude resort or anything. Nothing where it's ALL crazy party people, but a decent mix of just ""normal"" guys on vacation?

* Somewhere where it's not just all couples, but where a single guy could have fun.

* Beautiful scenery, other fun things to do in a weekend that isn't just the beach (although the majority of my time would be that).

Does such a place exist? I [checked this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1hiukf/gay_vacation_ideas_for_my_friend_and_i/) and it seems like Florida (Miami? LA? San Diego?) would be fun.

It might also be worth mentioning that preferably this would be somewhere I could enjoy for only a weekend + a day or so. I want to use my vacation days sparingly for one place so I can do more.

But anyway here's a quick background:

- Friend of friend, when he was told I liked him he wanted to know why he was only finding this out now. 
- Texting for a bit then I became a bit clingy by becoming overexcited.
- Left it for a month then met him again and we hooked up. He did text the day after and I replied but he never. Asking our mutual friend if I should text him I was told no incase I freaked him out again. 
- Waited a few weeks and then he started seeing the guy he was seeing before and was hung up. Guy then messed him about and he's single now. 
- I found out this week actually he couldn't understand that I liked him so much but I never spoke to him. My problem is because I liked him so much he made me nervous and it doesn't help that I'm a bit shy. And we're both similar in the sense that if one doesn't make the effort we probably won't. 
- Anyway I've been chatting to him anytime I see him on campus and then last week I seen him chatting on the phone and then he waved (no big deal at all except that he's never done this) and then a day later he waved while talking to a friend (The guy he was talking to likes him but he just wants to be friends so I thought it was a bit of a plus he stopped his conversation to wave at me lol).
- He had a very important paper due Friday past so he was up all day and night finishing it so he didn't come out with me and my friends (my good friend is his best friend) which was disappointing but understandable. I did snapchat him but he didn't reply but he did reply the next day just before he went to bed. 
- Cut to yesterday where I started texting him. He was studying for his exams that are finished in the second week of May so it did take him a while to reply but when he did the conversation did flow. He replied late last night and not to seem eager I did wait a reasonable time (40 minutes compared to his 3 hours :p) but he hasn't replied today which is ok considering my horoscope told me it might seem my love interest is ignoring me but they are not and that they will contact and that it will be fine (I don't normally believe in horoscopes but I do believe things happen for a reason so it can't just be a coincidence..considering I do overthink things). In the text he seemed different...in a good way though. There were smiley faces which is doesn't do haha and I did ask him a question so I did set it up for the conversation to continue.

The thing is, if anyone else came to me for advice and told me everything here I would say that he likes them. I spoke to a girl who is a the year above me on my course and we were talking about personal things and she said it sounds like he likes me. It's just I do have that fear of asking him out and being told no. What is the best way to proceed? I'm not going to text him at all today unless he replies. How do I suggest going for a drink or doing something? I don't mind him not replying considering I forget to text a friend back earlier. Also, the last time we were texting and I became clingy he told me when we hooked up that he was going to reply to me but that he was busy with coursework so I'm not all that worried about him not replying. What is slightly frustrating is his snapchat best friend list has changed in the past day meaning he has been on his phone but still :/ No point starting to worry about that. 

Anyone in similar situations? Is there a good time to text him back like in a day or two if he hasn't replied? There's been a lot of things happening lately that just seem too good to not be coincidences so I do want to show him again I'm interested in him instead of really liking him but being afraid of not making a move that this becomes a big missed opportunity. 

TL;DR: I like a friend of a friend, we've started to become acquaintances even after he started seeing someone again but is single now, I'm nearly sure he likes me and we started texting yesterday although he hasn't replied although he is studying and I'm a bad replier too at times. How do I ask him out or just try to take things further? etc. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;ve posted before about this, once trying to figure out stuff and the second time I posted I shouldn&amp;#39;t have because I was overthinking about things I should not of been.
