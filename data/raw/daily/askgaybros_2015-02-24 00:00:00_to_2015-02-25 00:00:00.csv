Above is the original novel I wrote. 

Anyway, things got a little awkward after the wedding was done and we got back to his place. I was alone with him for a few hours that Sunday before I had to drive back home. We watched some Netflix and he was shirtless and wearing some black shorts we used in marching band under our uniforms. They are short and tight as hell, and don't leave much to the imagination. Anyways, he's doing his usual groping, cuddling, and playing around off and on for these few hours, and I just try and smile and ignore it and then resist when it starts getting rough or ticklish. At one point he grabbed my hand, and put it on his thigh, and then moved my limp hand up his shorts...I almost moved my hand farther up on my own, but I kind of just slowly and awkwardly withdrew my hand back to myself...but I was so fucking horny at that point. I sat there trying to decide if I should make a move or say something. I really wanted to do something, but I sat there frozen for about 30 minutes, and finally decided that I should go and not try anything.

My phone was broken after the wedding party, so I ended up writing him on facebook a few days later because it bothered me not knowing if I could have gotten away with messing around with him. I basically told him that I felt like he wants me to make a move on him, and that I definitely would if given the chance, but not unless he said so. He replied back later, said that he's been asked by other gay guys also, and that I couldn't be more wrong (about him wanting me make a move). I replied back, said that's fine, and that I won't make a move on him, but that he is really pushing my boundaries. 

Fast forward to today, and we've still seen each other every few months. Nothing has really changed though. He still does his playful cuddling, groping, touching, biting, etc....and it's still awkward for me at times when we are around each other. I'm beginning to do the same things to him that he does to me if he starts it. It makes it stop sometimes, but touching him in any way just makes me want to do it more. It's better than sitting there passively trying not to get a boner.

Out of every one of our mutual friends, I know he treats me differently. I feel like he is a lot more attached to me than our other friends, and he goes out of his way to do nice things for me, that he doesn't do for our other friends (they all think he's a mooch, but he has always given things to me and helped me out without me even asking). There have also been some times where I notice his body language seems conflicting, and for some reason I feel like it's so obvious that he likes me because of his body language. It's hard to describe unless you actually see it, but he always seems like he is gravitating toward me when we are in a larger group of friends, and there have been some key points in conversations where I watch for some sort of body language response, and I feel like he's basically inviting me to suck his dick without saying anything.

Just this weekend he happened to visit, and he asked if I wanted to move back in with him and his other current roommate, since one was moving out. I am very tempted to, partly because I think there is still a chance for something to happen, and partly because I really need a cheap place to stay where I can can survive off of a crappy wage (and $200 a month plus utilities is hard to find). I also want to move back because I have no friends where I am at currently, and I would have much more and better opportunities for a job. 

I know we both consider ourselves best friends, but I'm not sure how much longer I can take the sexual tension that seems like it's been growing for the last 6 or 7 years...and now he wants me to move back in with him. If I do, and this keeps up, I'm not going to be able to be passive with him like I have the last couple of years and restrain myself from making any move on him. It felt great to touch him back near his crotch and make him back away and feel vulnerable, and I've only done it once recently. It turned me on to see him vulnerable for once instead of myself. It made us both laugh, so I don't see why I couldn't go a little farther next time...but now that I'm beginning to be more comfortable with reciprocating all the touching, tickling, groping, etc...I'm a little nervous with how much I can get away with, and nervous about going too far. 

Edit: Thanks for the replies. I just really needed to vent a bit to try and get this off my mind. I understand where you guys are coming from, but I don't just drop friends. I probably don't have as many to lose as you. I have too few already, because I'm introverted and have been going through some pretty bad depression for over 2 years, and stopped talking to everyone except a small group of friends because I can't handle much socializing while I'm dealing with it. Next time we meet up and he starts his crap I'll tell him what's up. All his sexual teasing turns me on, but if nothing is going to happen, then it needs to stop or at least get toned down to something more PG. I can handle basic cuddling, but I can't handle what I can only describe as play-rape.

He was in London on a study aboard program, and I was a local. He saw me on Scruff, I woofed back, and after a couple of months together and a lot more months apart, I asked him to marry me (He said yes)

So the love of my live moved here in 2014, the plan was:
•	Finish University ( He did this via online and graduated in July Last year)
•	Find a job in the entertainment industry

Unfortunately it’s been a year and he’s had almost no luck in finding a job. I know he is looking – I see the emails, the relentless job applications, the unhelpful agencies and what not – I’ve even sat next to him butt-naked while he stoically ignored me in favour of filling out his job application ( I’m not complaining lol, I’m just illustrating his dedication)

He did have one job at a ticketing agency, but the whole operation sounded kind of shady – add to that a death in his family, he quit two weeks in after carefully weighing up the pros and cons of continuing employment at the stranger place.

Other than that he has had only one interview with a Global children’s TV channel, which doesn’t seem like it’s been too successful.

For my part, I’ve done a lot to help him from helping him find agencies he can apply to, to getting his CV re-written professionally (that I paid for) to setting up his linked in profile, and offering multiple times to help with his search. Unfortunately I’m limited by my lack of knowledge of the industry that he wishes to work for and so wish I could do more for him.

Now, of course he has been disheartened by the lack of even a first interview, and has gotten it into his head that no one wants to employ him, this is hitting him particularly hard since he has never not had a job, and I need to get him out of this funk and fast! 

I’ve told him that he is mine, and that I am his, and I will take care of him for as long as it takes for him to find a job. He is after all responsible for me stepping up to my responsibilities and my motivation for bettering my career (Just got a 40% pay raise AND a promotion) and while we won’t be rich we will be comfortable well off

TL: DR How do I boost my husband’s self-confidence while he is looking for a job?

My hair is a level 4 (medium brown).  I wanted to bleach it to somewhere in the 9, 10, or 11 range.  I am also planning on growing it out from the aforementioned to something like this. 

http://www.mens-hairstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Long-Hairstyles-for-Men.jpg

I know bleaching your hair on your own or with the help of a friend is generally ill advised, but most of the salons in my area are pretty mediocre.  I am pretty good at things like cooking and other complex hobbies, so I think I could get how to use quickblue by loreal.  I am not sure if I would have to then lighten my eyebrows a little bit, especially if I went with a 10-11 rather than a 9 or 10.  I know the eyebrows don't necessarily have to be as light as the hair, but they could probably be a good bit lighter.  Likewise, if I did this it would probably be easier to figure out how to do my roots on my own, which would make touch ups in regard to color every 2 months not that bad.

Here are two techs for it, but I have the gist I think.  How ill advised is this?  Just the normal ill advised or like certain failure?  I don't know how light or the toner I want, but I would be fine with a more platinum blonde look or a more light blond/yellow look.  I would be down for either.  Something like this would be a lot easier than a two step bleach process like they would likely try at a salon to the same results.

Here is sort of the more white/platinum blond option as demonstrated by Tyler Oakley, and a Tumblr-er.

To my understanding if I start from the top and go down, wait like 20 min getting closer to the roots, and condition adequately, it should be pretty easy right?  As long as you don't go over 45 min (but especially an hour as you risk frying your hair and the bleach starts to lose its punch?).


My only other concern was that the condition of my hair would decrease with lifting it so many levels, but I am fine with the inherent decrease from the process, I just don't want to go orange or have my hair fried.

So, I wanted to ask all of you something and maybe seek out some advice as well. 

Well, I'm in the Midwest in a relatively small University. My RA happens to be gay and he has known me since my freshman year and has had a crush on me. 

Now... here's the thing, he admitted that he liked me and I admitted that I liked him (albeit vaguely in a way where I don't see him in a romantic sort of way). 

However, he seems to be on a 10 these days because he's stressed about graduation and his relationships with his fellow RAs have been strained due to his dramatic take on life. 

And now it's affected our relationship (which quite frankly, as bad as this sounds, I don't mind dropping him like an anchor). 

We used to mess around in bed (however, no oral or anal involved).. just some heavy making out and stuff. I saw it more as a sexual relationship rather than romantic, however he sees things differently. 

We're not dating, we're ""kinda best friends,"" according to him but I don't feel the best friendship mutually. He brought the whole best friendship thing into perspective on his own accord and I went along with it hesitantly. I've never considered him a best friend. I've told him personal stuff as an RA but he knows nothing else about my life. 

It's rather awkward really. He lives three doors down in my residence hall and I just pass by him like another person with a casual ""hey"" or ""hi.""

We used to joke around a lot and now he's just become this boring shell of a man that's become so critical of everything around him and he just exudes this negative, toxic aura around him that I just don't feel like being around him anymore.

Lately he's had this rude, bitchy attitude that I'm intolerant of and I've on a few occasions had to tell him how it is and check reality, and yet he acts like a high school girl who had her privileges taken away. 

Should I even continue this friendship with him? Or just drop him like an anchor?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys. So, I wanted to ask all of you something and maybe seek out some advice as well. &lt;/p&gt;

The few I've met so far are at most ok looking. I, on the other hand, would consider myself fairly attractive. My only flaw is a bald spot on the back of my head. My personality is great as well.

Since I'm interested in fashion and love brands like Gucci and Prada I'm also worried about being lumped together with fem gays. Therefore I'm too worried to wear clothes by these brands, even though I'd love to since I already own some clothes by them and love how great they look on me.

They didn't seem to mind and when we all sobered up no mentioning of me coming out as well, wondering if its common basically. 

So long story very short.
Friday night: Roommate's (male) ex gf/ current fuck buddy or spmething, who I have known for like 6 years drunk kissed me in front of him after she asked me if I am bi (which I still walled up and told her no because I'm more gay than bi).  Rage from him towards her ensued, which is understandable. After we got her safe and him calmed down, one of my other roommates who was the mediator got Matt and I to talk and figure out what happened. After the kiss happened I finished off the small bottle of Jameson I had (like 12-14 oz) which was like a quarter left. Already had the other 3/4 of the bottle that night and quite a few beers (like 8). 

So when talking to Matt, I end up coming out to both him and Nate. I show them a ""self help"" book I have about being gay basically and the one bracelet thing I had from the Chicago gaymers meetup from the summer. They seemed cool with it and not entirely surprised. we then calm down and keep talking and whatnot (or I might have been drunken rambling, this is where memories get fuzzy). Fall asleep on the couch with the wristband thing and book on our coffee table. Woke up and there was a note from my other roommate that says he (and his gf) still loves me on my self help book. 

Saturday: asking if my eye was ok (Matt and I were wrestling before anything got ugly and i bruised his rib and he gave me a black eye), me asking him if his rib is ok. Matt tells us his ex gf isn't allowed in the house anymore. Then asking about hangovers. 

Idk if there is a point to this more than seeing if its common to come out and them not mention anything about it after or whatnot. I guess because I have been thinking about it for so long I expected some sort of sober questioning of it because we are friends as well. (For reference I have come out to 1 friend prior to my roommates) 

EDIT:  Thanks for all the comments guys! it was the first real coming out that I had to people that i was not sure about how they would take it.

My mother literally said ""eww"" and asked me to change the channel. I got pretty upset that she reacted that way since I am gay myself and not out. I was actually planning on coming out to her, but I guess I am going to have to wait till I move out so there is no problems between each other while I still live under her roof. It bugged me a lot because her favorite uncle was gay and passed away in 2005 because of AIDS. How can she be so closed minded and disrespect us even after having a very healthy relationship with her gay uncle? This has clearly been bugging me all day and I just had to put it out there. Should I talk to her about her reaction? She is somehow a narcissist and believes she is right 100% of the time so I feel like talking to her is useless because it usually leads to arguing. I honestly cannot deal with living a secret life that I am pretty sure she knows about (I do not think that she wants to accept that I am a homosexual) anymore.

","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So yesterday my family and I were watching The Walking Dead and all of a sudden the two dudes start kissing... My mother literally said &amp;quot;eww&amp;quot; and asked me to change the channel. I got pretty upset that she reacted that way since I am gay myself and not out. I was actually planning on coming out to her, but I guess I am going to have to wait till I move out so there is no problems between each other while I still live under her roof. It bugged me a lot because her favorite uncle was gay and passed away in 2005 because of AIDS. How can she be so closed minded and disrespect us even after having a very healthy relationship with her gay uncle? This has clearly been bugging me all day and I just had to put it out there. Should I talk to her about her reaction? She is somehow a narcissist and believes she is right 100% of the time so I feel like talking to her is useless because it usually leads to arguing. I honestly cannot deal with living a secret life that I am pretty sure she knows about (I do not think that she wants to accept that I am a homosexual) anymore. I just needed to vent so thanks to whoever took the time to read this. I am actually on my break right this minute and won&amp;#39;t get out of work till around 11 so I probably will not be answering any questions till tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;

Gaslighting is: 
&gt; Gaslighting or gas-lighting is a form of mental abuse in which information is twisted/spun, selectively omitted to favor the abuser, or false information is presented with the intent of making victims doubt their own memory, perception and sanity.

Every now and then he'll claim he told me something, I deny it because I have no recollection of it, he then gets angry at me for 'lying' because he claims I did respond to it or he tells me I'm terrible at paying attention. He's good at arguing and pretty firm on his opinion, so I usually just go with it or apologize. I'm left feeling unsure of what exactly happened, I'll doubt myself, I feel like shit since I'm apologizing for things  I didn't even know I did wrong. 

Some examples are: 

* We were in the car, and he was absorbed in his phone. I find it rude since I want him to talk to me at least. I ask him if he found any new apartments for when he transfers school. I wait, and wait, and he doesn't say anything. I ask him again, and he said ""I already told you no"".
* That morning we went out for breakfast. Then met friends we were going to be driving with to the city, I mention that we had breakfast at a restaurant. He's pissed and tells me he told me that morning not to mention our breakfast because we were all going to eat together at a waffle house when we got to the city. I have no memory of this, I honestly would have asked why not to mention it since it's weird. He claims I did respond. He didn't speak to me for nearly an hour into the drive.
* He gets a new laptop, I ask about the specs an, he said it doesn't matter, I tell him it all matters. We meet a friend and he asks her for validation, but she says the specs do matter. He then tells me ""See? It's not just about the RAM, it's everything.""

I'm unsure if that's just him being an ass while being sarcastic, but it really does more than damage than make a laugh. 

He's often really strict/harsh on things. He bough girl scout cookies, gave me one and said that's the only one I'm getting. I ask for another, because him saying that earlier was rude. He says no a couple times after asking. As he leaves he gives me another, I ask him why and he says he's free to say no to me and that I have to accept anything he chooses to give me or not to give me. However, one time I went over with a six pack of glass coke bottles, didn't drink any and he took three on my way out as I carried them. He said he wanted them. I confront him about it and he says I was being a brat, since I asked for something he said no and I kept asking. I said he was a jerk, and he said he's not a jerk for saying no to something. I kind of agreed with him there.So, it's not really a selfish thing(?) I know, it's all petty and I don't see the point in saying no to the cookies in the first place. 

I believe he doesn't gaslight to manipulate me. His best friend who I'm well acquainted with says he has a tenancy to manipulate, though. I think he does this all just to get his way, rather than control people. It seems minor, it's not frequent but it is regular.

I'm just trying to figure out how to confront him on this. Any feedback would be appreciated. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re both 20, and have been in a relationship for almost 2 years.&lt;/p&gt;

The timeline:

Thursday, Feb.05 - Guy comes over, we hangout, eventually have sex. I don't even remember what all we did, but I think we did both ways, top and bottom. I think he topped me, used a condom. I tried topping him, with condom, couldn't get hard enough, ditched the condom then topped him.

Thursday, Feb.12 - Comes over again, hang out again, sex again. No condoms.

Thursday, Feb.19 - Receive a text that at first I was sure would be him asking to hang out again tonight. But instead:

&gt;I did my at home HIV test last night and it showed a faint positive. Now I have had the flu since Sunday and that can create that result, but I feel I should tell you. I just had my blood taken, and it will be a week or two before confirmation. [personal stuff]...I will update you with the final blood test.

I didn't get upset with him, but haven't communicated again since thanking him for letting me know and telling him I'll let him know how my testing goes.

But therein lies the issue. My most recent test was towards the beginning of last December, so not yet 3 months ago. I called my doctor's office, and the nurse said there wasn't really much to do other than wait a while longer and then test.


So what I want to know is, should I wait? Should I just start getting tested weekly or something? There have been no symptoms yet, but I know that for one, they probably wouldn't show yet, and for another, they sometimes never show.

I've ordered the lab test, and I can go into my doctor's office anytime and have the blood drawn, but when should I do that? As of this post it's been 11 days since the last time we had sex. And since it was a full week after that (4 days ago) when he notified me, I was sure no post exposure treatment would be of any help. Was I wrong? Is there still anything I can do? The odds seem pretty high given the circumstances that if he did indeed have it that it would have transmitted, but can anybody give me some actual percentages of likelihood? 

What questions am I missing? Anything I should ask him? Anything I should ask my doctor?

I'm not completely freaking out, halfway because I still don't want to believe it's happening, and the other half because I know it doesn't necessarily mean I'll get AIDS and die, I just will have to take medication for the rest of my life.

The kicker on top of it all is that I've been trying to figure out how to get on PrEP for the last few months, but not been able to find a way to afford it, even with my insurance (a separate story).

I should have listened to my instincts during the first date, but I disregarded it. There were so many red flags with my ex that it looked like the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics and everyone in the audience is waving the Chinese flag.

A few weeks after the relationship ended, he told me that he was in a new relationship. I learned yesterday that he was dumped by the new guy after 2 months, and, already, I saw him with a new date yesterday. (In case you're wondering, I live in the same building as him and I was talking to an employee in the lobby when I saw him)

I concluded in my mind that my ex is a total weirdo and psycho.

Some examples include:

- He'd purposely use the woman's bathroom because the men's bathroom is ""dirty"" -- and all he needed to do was pee.

- At restaurants, he'd dip his fingers in a glass of water to ""wash"" his hands instead of using the bathroom sink

- He has a long list of double standards, so he's a hypocrite

- He gets $25 haircuts (before tip) when he has almost a buzz cut and $40 manicures (before tip). Yet, he split hairs and throws immature fits about money, saying he's not rich, when I forget to pick up the bill.

- When his best friend told him that she wanted to commit suicide, he told her to go do it. And, he meant it.

He was the first person I've gotten into a relationship with that I met online, and that kinda scared me away from online dating.

And, I feel sorry for anyone who ends up with him.

 **Always listen to your instincts.**

I kept neglecting mine, but I would've saved myself so much time and money, if I listened to it.

Thank you for putting up with me :)

I'm American, he's from a very liberal region of Europe. 

My boyfriend also came out relatively late (at 20) because he had a girlfriend, but recently, it's come up in conversation that he sexually experimented with male classmates, etc. quite a bit throughout his entire youth. A couple of his first sexual experiences as a young teenager were with straight guys from his classes/summer camp, and throughout his later teenage years he would semi-regularly jerk off with other classmates, to the point where he lost count of how often it had happened, and one point even having a 5-guy jerk session (straight out of a porn plot) in his bedroom.

I, on the other hand, have the typical history of an American gay guy who grew up in a conservative religious town: my sexual expression until about age 20 was nothing but a black cloud of shame and disgust, jerking off in secret and feeling shitty about it afterward. It's a pretty familiar story to most people here, so I won't go so far into it - but this sort of thing is *totally unfamiliar* to my boyfriend. He says that he wasn't raised to really have hang-ups at all about sex, masturbation, experimenting with boys, etc., and that was the same for most other kids in his area. (I'm not convinced that his experiences were as normal in his area as he seems to think, but that's beside the point...) 

And when I think about the experiences he got to have in his youth, I get *really* jealous. Like, painfully jealous to the point where I can't properly think about anything else for an hour. The fact that he got to have a normal sexual self-discovery instead of having to find himself by cluelessly crawling into some dating website at age 20. That he got to grow up and see his sexuality as something normal and enjoyable instead of something wrong, messed-up, sinful. That he grew up with friendships that he could get close enough with to reveal the sexual side of himself, and that he got to see first-hand that other guys his age had the same curiosities as he did. That he didn't spend his entire youth, at his most sexually-driven, feeling shitty about being sexually-driven. And, of course, there's just a schoolboy porn-like fantasy to the whole idea of being able to seduce your straight guy friends in high school - something that I had until now always considered nothing more than a fantasy - but apparently, that was basically just how it actually was for him.

And I hate that I can't shake these feelings; I'm in a happy relationship with a great, attractive guy now, I'm out to my family and accepted, the religious shame is gone, everything's great. I should be able to bury my angst about my teenage years by now. I have something real and mature now, and I shouldn't be dwelling on how I missed out on shallow teenage sexual adventures. The culture I grew up in and how I've ended up are *far* from the worst experiences a gay guy can have. I understand all of this and how silly and pointless this jealousy is. But I still sometimes just get completely fixated thinking about what a dream it would have been for me to have what he had at that age, and it just makes me depressed for some reason - knowing that I'll never get to have those memories of being a horny teenager messing around with classmates, instead just getting to carry all the memories of embarrassment, shame, and fear. 

It's all just really dumb, and I can't figure out how to just let go and leave the past in the past. I find myself wishing that I had just never heard about my boyfriend's past so that these feelings never would have gotten dug up in the first place...

I don't know really what sort of advice I can expect on this issue. I've talked with my boyfriend about it, but he can't really understand what I'm feeling. I just kind of wanted to write it down and see if anyone else has ever dealt with the same sort of problem...","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m 23 and have been together with my first boyfriend for about a year now.

Basically I started seeing this guy [40m] and I'm 24, he's the first guy that's ever actually been really nice to me so this is definitely all new to me. We met on an app and initially it was just to hookup but he was really funny and super sweet so we ended up hanging out 6 times in 8 days. 

The other night we're just watching a movie and we start to talk about our age difference. I'm a recovering addict (to alcohol mostly) and have 4.5 months clean. You're not really supposed to date until you're at least a year clean but like I said, it was just supposed to be a one time hookup. So he asks me if I have a problem with him being 16 years older than me and I said no, that it doesn't bother me at all. Then he tells me he has to tell me he JUST got out of a relationship (2.5 months ago) of 11 years. They hadn't been intimate in like 5 years and he said it was over a long time before 2.5 months ago. He said he wants to make sure he's not just another addiction and that I'm not substitituting one addiction for another. He also said he wants to make sure I'm not just filling a void in his life and whatever...

THEN he drops the bombshell that the dude he was with ""still lives here""
Me: Like in XXX (city)?
Mike: No, like, upstairs. We sleep in different beds and he's gone every weekend.

Then I sort of got emotional and didn't know how to feel so I left and told him I needed some time to think it over. He's been trying to give me space but still wants me to spend the night next weekend (haven't done that yet). We're getting dinner tomorrow night and just hanging out. 

So... what should I do? I told him I want to take things super super slow. His ex doesn't have a move out date yet, and this is the first time any guys ever shown interest to actually date and not just (get) fuck(ed by) me. I told my brother about it and he said I need to make sure to never run into ex (let's name him Jeff) and to ask Mike if Jeff even knows I exist, if Jeff knows Mike's dating etc.
