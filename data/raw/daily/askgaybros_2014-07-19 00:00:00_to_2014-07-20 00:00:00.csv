I ll talk you about yesterday:
- we met after one yr and i brought my best girl friend and when he saw her,  he asked me in front of her - why you had to bring her???? i was like okkk and we started laughing. it was awkward
cuz she wasnt laughinh.
-after some time, we were walking down the street and he said to me, for no reason,  'let me kiss you' and i did nothing and he just moved on when a girl who was with us asked him if he was gay and he said 'yes i luv big asses'. again we just laughed.
- then i saw a couple- boy and girl we both know,  holding hands and asked M and my friend why they are holding their hands cuz they hated each other since ever. M said 'people who loves each other hold their hands' and he took my hand. the girl who was with us didnt see that cuz we were in the back. it took for a few seconds. i did nothing. after he released my hand he started talking smth to the girl and i couldn't hear what because i was thinking about what has just happened.
-later he said to me 'turn me hotspot on and ill give you a kiss'. i said i didnt have it.
-he also put his hand on my knee while we siting together...
* and all of this sh*t seem like big joke to me cuz, you know, he is too childish and maybe open and he's been joking all the time. he always touches me when we play basketball, like belly and ass - but yesterday he did it to another guy when they were playing basketball and that guy just pushed him off, so M got really sirous and told him he was just joking. i dont know, it was just 1 day but he does this shi*s every day to me and i started being confused. maybe i just make up things cuz i like him a lot...should i get him away next time? does he likes me or what? i really dont want to talk openly to him","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;im 17 and im gay but i havent came out and not planing to do it until leave homophobic place i live in.

I have never thought I'm vain or mean, and in fact, I always value personality over everything else when it comes to dating. But something happened today that is making me question myself.

To be blunt, he didn't look like someone I would date if it were just about appearance, and that thought made me tensed up throughout the whole ride.

He may not be physically attractive, but he may have a great personality. Hell, he may even be Mr. Right if the stars align. It bothers me that in that moment, I took it upon myself to be uncomfortable and not so much as returning a smile for his attention, and that I may have written somebody off just because of their appearance - the very thing I always preach against.

&lt;p&gt;He may not be physically attractive, but he may have a great personality. Hell, he may even be Mr. Right if the stars align. It bothers me that in that moment, I took it upon myself to be uncomfortable and not so much as returning a smile for his attention, and that I may have written somebody off just because of their appearance - the very thing I always preach against.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What to make of this? Am I really shallow or is this just how life&amp;#39;s supposed to be outside of Reddit?&lt;/p&gt;

He's a very affectionate guy in general, towards all guys and girls. Told me in the past he wasn't into guys, but again people do happen to cover up sometimes. Very happy-go-lucky, chill about things and so on.  He has a charming personality that I fall for every time, and he's good looking on top of that.  

He kind of got a little more toolish the longer I've gotten to know him and he started to push me to the side more.  It got to the point where I had to call him out on this and got upset.  He didn't seemed phased by it much, but admitted he was wrong for what he did and wants to start fresh.   I told him I needed time to get over things and he asked why I was making a big deal, and I told him he wouldn't understand. 

The next few days as I was struggling to get over him, I kind of took stuff out on him when I got pissed at something.  He noticed it, but didn't make a scene.  I apologized and eventually told him that ""I felt lead on"" and ""my feelings are getting in the way"" and that I know I can't have exactly what I want out of our relationship and I've been struggling.  He said he knows, but it doesn't bother him and just wanted to start things over.  I asked him why he wasn't freaked out or anything.  He just said it didn't matter and doesn't want things to be awkward between us.  He said he understands if I need whatever time I need to get over this.  We embraced and since then acted like things were back to normal before my feelings started to develop. 

Now my concerns are---
-I never officially told him ""I'm gay and I like you,"" but do you think what I said was a good way to imply it?  Do you think any straight could pick that up easily?  I felt that if I was more direct, he would have been freaked out more. 

-How do I best go about not relapsing?  Certain things that could trigger me- when he talks about girls, when he is affectionate towards them, etc.   Not as easy when I have to see him on a regular basis.  

I sound like a jealous selfish prick I know.  I should be happy for him, and appreciate that he sees me as a friend and not some creep.

I've been a top for all but one of my relationships.  The last time I bottomed for a boyfriend was when I was 18 and 19 (I'm 39 now).  I've met an amazing man who I've been in a relationship with for 7 months now, and I'm bottoming for him - something about him makes me want to give myself over to him.  Aside from that we're really good friends and there is really good communication between us. 

So now that I'm bottoming exclusively I've come to enjoy it a lot.  So much so that I want to explore it more, do some experimenting, build my skills and my confidence.  My bf doesn't have as high of a sex drive as i do, and he doesn't want to be my sex toy - to him, we should have sex together out of love instead of doing it just to do it.  I get that.  So I asked him if he would be ok with me finding someone on the side to play, learn, and experiment with.  He was very supportive of the idea - he is not the jealous type at all, he knows this is important to me, he knows I'm committed to him first and above anyone else,  and he likes that it would take some of the pressure off him to constantly attend to his horndog boyfriend even when he isn't really in the mood himself.

This all sounds ideal, right?  Everyone wins!  Except I'm scared out of my mind of screwing something up.  I have no logical basis for being afraid, but this guy means a lot to me.  I could see myself with him for a very long time.  I know opening up a relationship comes with some risk, and I would feel like an idiot for screwing it up just to pursue sex.  It would hurt BAD.  I'm not even sure it's worth the risk.  

I feel disloyal and selfish, even though my bf is encouraging and thinks it's probably a positive for me as an individual and us as a couple. 

Can anyone relate to this?  Is my fear and hesitation a normal thing, or a sign that this isn't for me - or at least not yet.  I can't identify the source of my fear other than that it may change the dynamic between us for the worse and lead to breaking up a relationship that is very special to me.

Sorry for the long post.  If anyone has any perspective to share on this I'd really appreciate it.  ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone, thanks for taking the time to read all this.&lt;/p&gt;

I&amp;#39;ve met an amazing man who I&amp;#39;ve been in a relationship with for 7 months now, and I&amp;#39;m bottoming for him - something about him makes me want to give myself over to him.  Aside from that we&amp;#39;re really good friends and there is really good communication between us. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now that I&amp;#39;m bottoming exclusively I&amp;#39;ve come to enjoy it a lot.  So much so that I want to explore it more, do some experimenting, build my skills and my confidence.  My bf doesn&amp;#39;t have as high of a sex drive as i do, and he doesn&amp;#39;t want to be my sex toy - to him, we should have sex together out of love instead of doing it just to do it.  I get that.  So I asked him if he would be ok with me finding someone on the side to play, learn, and experiment with.  He was very supportive of the idea - he is not the jealous type at all, he knows this is important to me, he knows I&amp;#39;m committed to him first and above anyone else,  and he likes that it would take some of the pressure off him to constantly attend to his horndog boyfriend even when he isn&amp;#39;t really in the mood himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This all sounds ideal, right?  Everyone wins!  Except I&amp;#39;m scared out of my mind of screwing something up.  I have no logical basis for being afraid, but this guy means a lot to me.  I could see myself with him for a very long time.  I know opening up a relationship comes with some risk, and I would feel like an idiot for screwing it up just to pursue sex.  It would hurt BAD.  I&amp;#39;m not even sure it&amp;#39;s worth the risk.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel disloyal and selfish, even though my bf is encouraging and thinks it&amp;#39;s probably a positive for me as an individual and us as a couple. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can anyone relate to this?  Is my fear and hesitation a normal thing, or a sign that this isn&amp;#39;t for me - or at least not yet.  I can&amp;#39;t identify the source of my fear other than that it may change the dynamic between us for the worse and lead to breaking up a relationship that is very special to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the long post.  If anyone has any perspective to share on this I&amp;#39;d really appreciate it.  &lt;/p&gt;
