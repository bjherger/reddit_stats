I'm a sophomore in college and I have no idea how to date. I've never *been* with a guy/girl before in any capacity. No sex, kissing, or anything. I'm completely out of the closet among my friends, but I have no idea how relationships work, or even how to even find them!

I've tried attending lgbt clubs on campus, but I don't enjoy them. Elsewhere, I've looked on grindr, okcupid, and tinder, and I've had some brief conversations with people. They always fizzle out, mostly with me not knowing what to say/ask next. I don't want a hookup, and I don't know how to ask for a date (since I wouldn't know how to have one to begin with).

On Tinder yesterday I matched with a guy from a class last year — a guy I had a crush on. I said hi, we briefly spoke about that class we had, how our summer went, and here I am. Stuck.

What can I do to move forward? And even if I get there, I have no clue how to do the whole relationship thing, especially since I don't own a car and I'm basically stuck in campus dorms.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi &lt;a href=""/r/askgaybros""&gt;/r/askgaybros&lt;/a&gt;, someone suggested I ask this here...&lt;/p&gt;

Anyway he showed up on facebook the other week so I added him and he accepted, he then added me on Steam (PC Gaming DigitalDistro/Community for those not familiar).

Only thing is on his facebook it says ""interested in women"", but a lot of closeted gays do that.

He's just a sweet guy and I think we work so well together because we balance each other out. I'm crazy, a little obnoxious, and the one making jokes all the time. He's the quiet guy who doesn't have much to say, but when he does speak it's significant in some way whether it's incredibly romantic, intelligent, or hilarious.  
  
So...I guess our problem is that he doesn't want to be exclusive. It's not an open relationship because technically we aren't even boyfriends, but we still have sex together, we still hang out a lot. He's also admitted that he has strong feelings for me. He's just not ready for commitment. Although I really want to be with him exclusively, for some reason it doesn't bother me too much that he fucks other guys. I get that we are really young and in college, so the pressure of commitment can be a lot. I would rather him get the sex out of his system as well as his need to conquer as many bottoms as possible (lol) on our campus than to commit to me when he isn't ready and he ends up breaking things off because he's not ready and that possibly ends a future together.  
  
I'm pretty sure that he is my one. I believe that someone can probably have a few ""ones"", but they're difficult to find and I think for the most part we are great together...  
  
I'm willing to wait for him to get it out of his system as he's said that he wants to be with me, but just isn't ready. Some of the fears in the back of my mind are that he says these things because he knows it makes me a backup plan for his horniness...I always say yes. But some signs against this is that he texts me to just hang out with no sexual context and we do this a lot. We hang out or go out together and don't end up having sex. And when I text him he 7/10 times will make space for me in his schedule. So I don't think that this is just some stupid thing.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I very much care for this guy I&amp;#39;ve known for a while.

We both had an awesome time, go back to his place and watch SVU for a while. Despite that being possibly the most un-romantic show in history, we end up in his bedroom and fool around a bit. We decide to go to dinner and end up back at his place, have sex, and I stay the night. 

The next morning we go to my apartment where I make us breakfast. He leaves to shower and I clean up as well, but we end up spending most of that day together as well. 

We keep texting over the next few weeks and hang out/make out/cuddle (but no sex). This includes texting good morning/night most days. 

The last week or so I noticed some mixed signals. He wouldn't reply to texts when I'd suggest getting together, but still initiated conversations and texted good morning, etc. So I just told him I wanted to talk and he agreed to meet up. I lay out what I had noticed and that I also wanted to get to know him better. (I had by now realized that he's *everything* I look for in a guy and I could easily see myself in a relationship with him).

He apologizes for it and says that he didn't mean to blow me off like that.

The next day he says that we need to talk again, since he ""didn't have the balls to talk about it the other night"". As it turns out he hadn't realized I wanted more than a hookup/friends since that's what my Grindr said, and had started talking to another guy that he'd known for two years. 

He told me he valued my friendship and considered me to be a 'very good friend' despite only knowing me for a month; but that's all we could be right now. 


It's been about a week since that conversation, so the immediate emotions have died down but I still feel very hurt and rejected. I want him in my life, but I don't know if I can be *just* friends. If him and the other guy don't work out I would gladly get involved with him again; but at the same time I know I'd feel like the ""second choice"" regardless of that not being the reality of it. 

The advice I got from a friend who's been partnered for eight years was to stay in contact and keep being in his life but tread the boundaries carefully.

Based on that I've been having a short text conversation with him every other day and I'm going to try to hang out with him this week in a public setting (such as asking him to come with me while I train a service dog). 

I just really want to know your perspectives on this, bros- and what advice you may have for me.

Today I want to ask you guys for your opinion and advises, first I will tell what happened before so everyone knows: I met this guy at my gym, I really liked him and I was getting hints that he might like me back, but I was not sure and most of you told me to ask him out and see what happened. 

Here is what happened: Yesterday I arrived like at 7PM at the gym and he was there training already,so I saluted him and he immediately asked me if I was doing something tonight and I was like no and he said he had a party with some friends and If I would like to go to grab some beers and of course I said yes. So we went there got drunk and had a good night. I was trying to be flirtatious with him and at one point he asked me if I was bisexual or gay, and that he didn't had any problem with that. So I told him I was gay and he just said cool and keep talking, he told me he had a bisexual ""season"" when he was younger and nothing else happened. So we grabbed a Taxi, I took him to his home and he told me to message him as soon as I arrived mine. So I sent him a message and the next thing he is sending me a lot of messages telling me he had a great night and how glad he was that I came and at some point I took like 5 minutes not answering and he send me a message telling me why I was taking so long to answer him, we talked like for an hour and then he went to sleep, today he keep talking to me.
I would say he likes me, but last night I was trying so hard to leave hints, so he realized that i liked him, but he never said anything to make me thing that he likes me, other than asking me If I was gay.

Is he playing with me? what should I do? Is he just being a good friend?
