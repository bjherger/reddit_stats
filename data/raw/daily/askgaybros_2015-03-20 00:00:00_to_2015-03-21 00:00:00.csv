And I'm sure many people will see the title and just absolutely rage at me for considering this, to that I would say - please hear everything I know before taking a side.

The situation is this - I posted an advertisement on craigslist looking for an LGBT friendly roommate for when I go to college, which included the address of my apartment. Someone named Gary messaged me and, while a lot older, seemed interested in the apartment, but started asking personal questions. Suddenly he stopped asking about the unit (I thought we were still talking about renting) and asked if I would have anal sex with him.

Mind you, at this point I have his phone number and personal images. Reverse searching this information revealed to me that he has been married to a woman since 1992 and is the manager of the adult ministry of a moderately large Methodist church that was once (a few years ago but still under his employ) anti-gay (now their stance seems to be neutral?). **I have confirmed that this is his real identity and he really did want to meet me.** If I post any more information, other people may find this guy so I will stop there, but I will mention that I am 100% certain that I have all his personal information, employment info and a little bit on his wife.

So the big question is - what do I do about this. Gary does not know much about me, but knows enough that he could retaliate with slander or legal prosecution for slander if I contact either his wife or church. On the other hand, let's be serious, I am a borderline minor and the fact that an openly anti-gay clergyman is willing to go behind his wife and go after people who don't do their homework makes me sick.

**EDIT:** I appreciate the advice I am receiving immensely. Obviously this is not an easy issue to process. I would like to re-assert something I mentioned in the comments - **Gary is not an LGBT ally and is certainly not a victim. He has spoken out against homosexuality in recent years.** In accordance with the subreddit rules his personal information will never be exposed.

**EDIT 2:** I have received some threats in and out of this thread, no big deal. Here is my decision - I am going to take a break, get lunch, then continue on my work in trying to locate the wife's contact info (if anyone who has experience with background checking could help, that would be appreciated). I will use a disposable mailing address and VPN routed through another country to e-mail the husband to inform him that a separate disposable address would be used to contact the wife next Saturday, which will afford the minister some time to address things on his own terms, without avoiding the issue. 

This will not become a public matter because it would ruin the guy's chance of employment, quite honestly, which is horrible for anyone. I will not contact the church, but if for some reason my personal safety is threatened by this minister, I have a database of all the current and former employees at the Methodist church and I'll have an e-mail prepared to send to either some or all the employees.

I'd like to thank the regulars in the sub who have been supportive of me in addressing this issue.

**EDIT 3:** If you have any input to add, especially about the legality of the situation, please feel free to PM me - I'd appreciate it. It's getting a little hard to take this thread seriously at this point due to all the trolling (seriously, don't make this a generic hate thread please).

It's my understanding that moderation in /r/askgaybros doesn't believe in censorship, but I'd kind of appreciate it if someone cleaned this thread up so we can read the constructive stuff. If a mod wants proof that this is not a troll thread, I can show them what I've been saving for verification like an IAMA thread. In the meantime, don't use this thread to funnel your hatred for Christians. Or anyone my age with an ethical dilemma, please.

**EDIT 4:** /u/Whamo has run through this thread with about 30 short comments. Trolling or not, they contain a lot of misinformation. To address a few points others have made:

* There is no ""arrangement"", or if there is, the wife is not allowed to know anything.
* The information about ""Gary"" (not his real name) and his affiliation with the clergy is included because he has lobbied against homosexuality with his congregation with several publications. The fact that he is lobbying a moderately large church in my hometown against homosexuality, when he in fact is homosexual/bisexual/a man who actively has sex with men, is what I feel takes this beyond an issue between husband and wife to an issue where a trusted advisor on moral issues is actively hurting the gay community, my town and his wife. He is hurting everyone that could possibly be affected by his conduct.
* This isn't about me or my city, but it is about the gay community as ""Gary"" has hurt us. Now I do not represent the gay community as a whole, but being gay and making sure that fellow LGBT brothers able to live in harmony is very important to me. ""Gary"" is involved in adult discipleship administration at a major church in my area and is responsible for publishing some vehemently anti-gay articles that encourage going beyond the shaming of people who are LGBT
* I am going to do something about this, and it will probably simply be me informing his wife. I'm not going to get the media or the clergy involved *at all* because that's honestly way too zealous (I don't like the guy, but neither do I like shaming) and has high potential for litigious backfire and retaliation.

**If there is anyone who has legal advice on this situation or has access to background checking resources, please contact me via PM** I am working on the best solution for this.

* Minor addition to this, I do have some contact information, but for the wife all I have is a landline shared with the husband that hasn't been answered all day.

I made quite a few comments today, most of which cover finer details about this. You all have given me a lot to think about and sleep on. Thank you :).","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am kind of shocked by finding this out so pardon me if I&amp;#39;m not &amp;quot;with it.&amp;quot; And I&amp;#39;m sure many people will see the title and just absolutely rage at me for considering this, to that I would say - please hear everything I know before taking a side.&lt;/p&gt;

One straight friend has a son who likes the movie Frozen and wanted a themed b-day party. He said ""not my son, he's going to have a TMNT themed party. He's going to watch TMNT more. I won't have my son growing up gay.""

Another straight guy who I assumed might be gay/bisexual because he's 22, been single for awhile, turns down girls who flirt with him, likes Taylor Swift music, etc. Anyway, he recently said he's going to stop watching The Walking Dead because of a recent gay kiss. He said because of that kiss, the show has become ""too soap opera."" 

And a third friend recently made a status update saying ""I think it's okay if two girls want to be lesbian, but I'm against guys being gay"", or something similar to that. He got tons of ""you're ignorant"" comments but no one really deleted him. I guess because he's attractive.

I can't have gay friends because I live in a low populated area (the nearest major city is about 8 hours) so the only ""out"" guys are the over the top feminine ones. And they're embarrassing. I don't have grindr either because I don't want to be outed.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;m in my early 20&amp;#39;s, live in a small hick town, bisexual and in the closet, so everyone thinks I&amp;#39;m straight.

I'm 26, been in a relationship with my boyfriend for almost two years. This is the best relationship I've been in (I've been in a few other relationships, longest was about 9 months in length) and I feel like I finally have it right - we communicate well, outlooks on life are similar, we love spending time together, our families like spending time with us together, sex is good. In truth there is nothing wrong. We've talked hypothetically about long-term plans, and probably about 70 percent of the time I am thrilled and feel like this is the relationship I want to pursue for the long haul. But there's that 30%. It's scared that if I commit to this relationship, what if I've missed something better out there with someone else? There was a guy I'd gone on a date with back before me and my bf got together who I'd been really into but who didn't want to pursue things, and I worry, what if there's someone out there like that guy, or someone I've never even thought of or who's more attractive or even more on the same wavelength as me than my bf?

So I'm in need of some serious advice.
As the title says, the guy I'm dating is way more into me than I am into him. The details pretty much go like this: We have only been dating about 2 weeks, and though for me it wasn't fireworks the first date, I could tell he was a great guy and would be great for me. However, for him its like I am the world to him, and he even through out the L word today as we discussed where the two of us were headed. There are moments where I am really into him, and that I could see myself in a long term relationship with him. However that seems to suddenly change at times and I could honestly care less if we were dating or not.
I don't really understand why I'm like this, and I have hurt someone else in the past because of this reason. The only thing I can think of is that last year, I met a guy and had the same feelings for him this current guy is feeling for me. After only two dates and then a month of attempting a long term relationship, he broke things off and I was devastated. Maybe because I didn't feel that way with this new guy, I just assume its not gonna work at times, and my brain decides it wants nothing to do with him?
I'm sure you can see where my frustration comes from and why I'm seeking advice. The current guy has told me that he is willing to put up with my indecisiveness for some time, but that won't last forever because he doesn't want to get hurt like he has in the past, and the last thing I want to do is hurt him.

Last night I was on Grindr just chilling when a guy messages me. I've spoken to him before a long time ago but he obviously didn't remember me so I didn't bother trying to remind him. Anyway, I'm not attracted to him but I keep talking to be polite. So he asks me what I do &amp; I tell him that I'm a barista &amp; he's like, ""I just got hired as a barista at *insert coffee shop chain*."" I freeze because I also work at the same coffee chain. And I'm a supervisor. I ask him which one he got hired at &amp; it's the same one where I work. I told him that I was going to be one of his bosses &amp; he seemed a little taken aback, because he's a person.

However, any reservations he had didn't last long. While he told me initially that he could be professional &amp; not talk about this, he still talked about wanting to hang out. I explained to him that corporate doesn't like that sort of thing &amp; that I could get fired. He said that was stupid, that we wouldn't have to tell anyone &amp; spent the rest of the time talking about how lonely he was &amp; how he wished he could go out.

I just want to cover my butt in case he makes things uncomfortable or gets mad &amp; tries to make my life more difficult than it already is.

Also, I only told him I worked there because I didn't want to risk blocking him &amp; then a week later there I am on his first day, acting like nothing happened. I thought that might make him more angry.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So this go-around on Grindr I&amp;#39;ve managed to get myself catfished (a post I wrote a few days ago) &amp;amp; now I&amp;#39;ve possibly gotten myself into an awkward situation at work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night I was on Grindr just chilling when a guy messages me. I&amp;#39;ve spoken to him before a long time ago but he obviously didn&amp;#39;t remember me so I didn&amp;#39;t bother trying to remind him. Anyway, I&amp;#39;m not attracted to him but I keep talking to be polite. So he asks me what I do &amp;amp; I tell him that I&amp;#39;m a barista &amp;amp; he&amp;#39;s like, &amp;quot;I just got hired as a barista at &lt;em&gt;insert coffee shop chain&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;quot; I freeze because I also work at the same coffee chain. And I&amp;#39;m a supervisor. I ask him which one he got hired at &amp;amp; it&amp;#39;s the same one where I work. I told him that I was going to be one of his bosses &amp;amp; he seemed a little taken aback, because he&amp;#39;s a person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, any reservations he had didn&amp;#39;t last long. While he told me initially that he could be professional &amp;amp; not talk about this, he still talked about wanting to hang out. I explained to him that corporate doesn&amp;#39;t like that sort of thing &amp;amp; that I could get fired. He said that was stupid, that we wouldn&amp;#39;t have to tell anyone &amp;amp; spent the rest of the time talking about how lonely he was &amp;amp; how he wished he could go out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So as soon as all of this happened I made screenshots of every part of our conversation. I&amp;#39;ve since deleted my profile as well. Now I don&amp;#39;t know what to do. Just based on his responses he doesn&amp;#39;t seem to have the maturity to respect the boundary that I said was there with me being one of his bosses.

We're both 20, and have been together almost two years.

One time the guy left a digital painting he did of my boyfriend on his FB, and he would text him regularly or so. They would hang out every so often or less, and the guy would even give my boyfriend massages since he's a masseuse. He'd charge him, of course, but that just seems odd to me. 

The guy seemed gay. Several months back. while they hung out the guy told my boyfriend that he didn't care if he was in a relationship, that he wanted to cuddle and that he has a crush on him but he said no. The thing is though, they'd still text every so often, and they seem to hang out a little less. I asked my boyfriend but he said the guy was still hung up on his own ex.

However, I don't think the guy has let up. Several weeks ago we passed by the guy and he went into a hug with my boyfriend they chatted, he had a huge smile on too, and he asked for another hug before parting ways. He also ignored me the entire time, lol. Today there was a note on my boyfriend's windshield from the guy just saying hi. I asked my boyfriend why the guy was being flirty, in a joking way to be light about it. He didn't answer he just went on about it was written in red ink and how weird it was. It was just a bad way to divert the question, who cares about the ink. 

I'm tired of asking and being annoyed by it, but I still am. My boyfriend is not so clear about it or specific, he does tell me to not worry and says nothing is going on when I ask seriously. 

It's annoying, I'm sure nothing is going on but I'm honestly just tired of being annoyed by it and having it come up every so often. He also says he hasn't gotten a massage from him in a while.

My posts are silly, mostly, about art we love and other such things. But I have a slightly more serious question.

I've been out of the closet since I was 16, and while I haven't always been a proud gay man, I've grown into one more recently at 24 - volunteering with Pride, serving on LGBT organizations' boards, volunteering at my community association, and one day vying for City Council in a decade or so (that may change). I thrive when I work. That's just how I do.

But that isn't important. Recently, I hooked up with a friend called Joey* (not real name). Now, normally, I'm glad that sex is on the table, but Joey is 44 years old - handsome, built, yada yada - and I'm a little nervous about this. Joey is a prominent member of the LGBT liaison committee in our city working through official questions and concerns facing our city. It's fun to have someone to talk politics with - and having the politics be actual, concrete, and non-activist heavy (activism in this city sometimes borders on the meh). We've been on a few dates since the hookup, and have had fun every time.

My concern, I think, is I'm half his age - Joey's 5 years my parent's junior at 49. He also has two children from a previous relationship, and an ex-wife. Add to that that also he works in a place that I am pushing myself into as well, official LGBT work. I'm serving on the Pride Board and a youth organization's board. I'm giddy and happy, but a touch nervous because I come from a background that is fairly strict - military and cafeteria Catholic - and love my parents. I guess I'm tossed between loving my family, and enjoying this guy's company.

I guess I'm posing this to the age-gap gaybros out there: do you feel like you need to navigate these feelings? How common are they? Do they disappear? I like him well, so I'm not prepared to throw the baby out with the bathwater.

TL;DR: seeing a guy 20 years my senior with two kids, and involved in my workplace life. Best navigation techniques. I'm also, by the by, keen on hearing personal stories. **EDIT** Unclear. We do not work together, we work in a small-ish city in LGBT issues.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been a frequent poster and commenter around these parts, giving advice about dating, self-love, and self-esteem. My posts are silly, mostly, about art we love and other such things. But I have a slightly more serious question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been out of the closet since I was 16, and while I haven&amp;#39;t always been a proud gay man, I&amp;#39;ve grown into one more recently at 24 - volunteering with Pride, serving on LGBT organizations&amp;#39; boards, volunteering at my community association, and one day vying for City Council in a decade or so (that may change). I thrive when I work. That&amp;#39;s just how I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that isn&amp;#39;t important. Recently, I hooked up with a friend called Joey* (not real name). Now, normally, I&amp;#39;m glad that sex is on the table, but Joey is 44 years old - handsome, built, yada yada - and I&amp;#39;m a little nervous about this. Joey is a prominent member of the LGBT liaison committee in our city working through official questions and concerns facing our city.
