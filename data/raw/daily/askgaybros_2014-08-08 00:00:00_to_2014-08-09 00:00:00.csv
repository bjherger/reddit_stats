Hi all, 
I was wondering if guys had any advice for a young guy looking to date.
First the background, I’m a 27 well educated gay male who just happens to be in a wheelchair due to cerebral palsy. I live just outside Nashville Tennessee. (TN)
The major problem seems to be that gays my age or younger seem completely unwilling to date someone in a wheelchair. Before I get jumped on allow me to state for the record I would not mind dating someone older. I think the unwillingness to date a guy in chair stems largely from being uninformed about that actually means. Based on years of experience people generally assume one or both of the following things. 1. Just because I have a physical disability I also have a mental one. 2. That because I am in a chair I am unable to have sex, when in fact I quite enjoy sex and am very open mined sexually and  I view sex as an important part of a romantic relationship. I know part of these attitudes develop form a lack of exposure to people in wheelchairs.
I am also aware some of the fault for my complete failure at landing a date lies with me. I’m almost painfully shy when meeting new people in person and am not really into the bars or club scene. But have no problem opening up while behind a keyboard. People often say to me find a group of people with common interest then you meet someone. Well I’m not in school and currently looking for work. I did recently join a gaymer group in Nashville but most of those guys are taken. All this being said I have two questions. Do any of you have any ideas for meeting guys and when it comes to online dating sites when should I mention the fact I’m in a wheelchair? This revelation tends to send people running I don’t want to let my chair define me nor do I want to be accused of hiding the fact.

I recently posted [this]( http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/2cbtsu/dating_a_guy_who_is_irresponsible_with_money/) concerning my bf making a very stupid choice regarding taking on a stupidly huge debt on behalf of some family. By the way if anyone was confused ""dating"" and ""boyfriend"" are synonymous terms in my area.

So after a wonderful weekend out together, we finally had time on Monday to sit down and chat. I started off with the dreaded ""We need to talk"" and he instantly looked worried so that was a good start (sarcasm... though I'm glad it was being taken seriously). I said we needed to talk about this debt he was taking on. Thanks to the fantastic advice from the bros I was ready to break down payments with him, explain how it was going to severely stunt his life plans etc.

And you know what he said bros? I just wanted to kiss him and slap him in one motion. He said ""Oh I've decided not to do it. It's too much for me to do and too dangerous"". Of course this was great but I still had to clear the air on this and said the following.

""Things like this impact the both of us, you have to be aware of that. Not telling me you had decided not to do this was pretty not cool cause it has been eating at me""

""You have to understand that I was ready to break up over this. I cannot justify having a future with someone who would throw away their own future""

""I understand you care for this woman but I find it very suspicious that someone of her age who says she cares for you would even consider allowing you to go through with this""

""They are a different generation with their own problems and it is not up to you to fix them. You have your own life to look out for. Moving out and getting an education(university) would have been impossible had you have gone through with this""

""Do you understand why I'm saying these things and why I've reacted this way?""

He did understand, he apologised and he ""felt a bit stupid"" for not realising how upset I had gotten over all this. (I come from a very emotionally abusive background so faking smiles is easy when I want to.)

All in all it went well. There was kissing and ""I love you""s and though he was visibly shocked at how strongly I had reacted to this event I think that is just him learning the difference between a teenaged and adult relationship. I love that he is such a caring guy and it is good to see that though his good nature was being exploited, his common sense won out after all and he learnt a lesson in relationships. Me? I learnt once again that age isn't just a number. Dating a chiseled, naturally tanned, hot-as-the-sun 18yo definitely has its perks but different levels of maturity require time, patience and communication. 

So thanks again for the advice bros. It definitely helped me approach the conversation with a level head.

Dating a chiseled, naturally tanned, hot-as-the-sun 18yo definitely has its perks but different levels of maturity require time, patience and communication. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So thanks again for the advice bros. It definitely helped me approach the conversation with a level head. Hopefully some lurkers will learn something from this too!&lt;/p&gt;

There's no doubt my life would be easier (overall) if I were straight, but how much easier? I'd still be poor, I'd still be unemployed, I'd still have absolutely nothing in common with my dad or most other guys, I'd still be bipolar and I'd still have a dodgy heart. My life would be easier, but not much, and I'd still have all of my other problems too. 

I've always believed in the importance of trying to look on the bright side and focusing on the positive, and even though it's normal to spend many years wishing you were hetero and focusing on all the disadvantages you have when it comes to being gay, I thought it would be good for young gay guys who might be here and might still be in this ""woe is me"" phase to read a thread with gay guys talking about the *advantages* that come with being gay for once

 

For me, when I read Gender Wars drama, or listen to the stresses of heterosexuals in regards to dating, I'm struck by how disconnected from the experience I am; gay guys just don't seem to come with the same amount of drama as heterosexual relationships, and I am greatful for that every time I see a hetero couple fighting or any of the other stresses that seem to come with being heterosexual. 

In addition to that, there are many heterosexual traditions and practices which are set in stone and people feel pressured to conform to these rigid standards such as the male proposing to the female or paying for dates; there is a lot of ""dating poltics"" which have been cultivated over time for heterosexual relationships which don't exist for us, primarily because we haven't been allowed to cultivate our own ""rules"" - for me this is an advantage and something to be greatful for because it's much more relaxed and you are much more free to do your own thing. Sure there are a bunch of disadvantages too like PDA in public or marriage rights, but an advantage is still an advantage! Like I said I think it's important to try and look on the bright side whenever possible (especially if you are a pessimist naturally like me or have depression and stuff like that)

and of course who can forget - double your wardrobe!

So how about you guys? I know there are a lot of disadvantages and stuff you *don't* like and could talk about for hours on end, but for once tell us about the stuff you *do* like about being gay!
