Or sure.

I'm gonna be frank about the questions cause meanings often get lost in diplomatic languages. I'm just looking for info and mean no disrespect or ""going-to-the-zoo""-esque type of thing. I'm trying to figure out my sexuality but haven't had much interaction with the gay community, and am anxious about going in blind.

So the gist of my question is the following:

A) Is the atmosphere in a gay club/bar welcoming to guys who haven't been with a guy before?

B) Is it hostile to possible bisexuals? 

C) Do bearish/kinda chubby/medium hairy guys go to the same clubs as the superripped/shaved chest guys? (I'm the former)

D) Should I even try this out until I figure out if I'm attracted to guys or would it be insulting? (Will contexualize below)

Hey. I'm 20 for context. Im not too sure how to organize this info so it'll pribably come iut super haphazard. So for the past 5 or so years I've been in straight relationships. I got out of a 2.5 year commitment a couple months ago and have been getting to know myself since. I've been trying out different masturbation techniques, orgasm types (especially combined with weed). My first sexual masturbatory experience was actually anal, and I enjoyed the feeling of being penetrated. It was like a year after that that I found out what the deal with the penis was and how to jack off. However, I grew up straight, thinking gay was something very other than me. There's probably the whole dominance machiasmo sociopsychology reasons why I was afraid of looking at gay porn or revealing my enjoyment of being penetrated. I even hated seeing the guy at all in straight porn, and much prefer lesbian porn. Maybe there's some muslim aspect as a child as well, but my parents have been very progressive in instilling a view of god as very accepting and not cruel. 

So I grew up and had girlfriends and I know very surely that I am attracted to women and vaginas and boobs and such. But I was very avoidant of gay porn. Maybe because my first instances of it were lemon party and meatspin. But I've always been the bromance kind of guy. Slapping best friends' butts, free with hugs and kisses, not really afraid of the times I had to dress in drag for school projects, judging guys' beauty. I wasn't afraid of ""appearing"" gay. I was a big guy, strong, and confident. 

But we just didn't have many out kids at our school. So I never got to hang with em. Anyway. Since my breakup, I'm looking at all kinds of porn and asked myself why I was uncomfortable with guys not being in domineering positions. I was the dominant one with my ex, but I enjoyed it when she took over. And I've always been appreciative of a guy's beauty. But in the past I haven't known if I liked something until I did it. I never sought out a guy though, mainly because I didn't know any, and I had this fear of not being respected by two of my best friends (one was rather homophobic at the time, although he's realized he was just being fuckthepoliticallycorrect system; the other is a devout muslim). I finally got over my ego and looked at some 'romance' (?) gay porn and feel exactly the same as I do with girls. I have kissed a guy before and it was like kissing a girl, but I was extremely drunk and at a punk show. I want to know if I'm sexually attracted to guys (I know I can be emotionally connected), and I can't know that without doing the thing.

So yeah. There's the above questions.

I guess as a sidenote, what is the likelihood of finding someone for the night? Cause if so, I only have a vague idea how to suck a dick and would wanna study up.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throwaway because I&amp;#39;m not out. Or sure.&lt;/p&gt;

I've even gone to the doctor and I'm taking prozac and some xanax type drug to help me cope with panic attacks.

I'm trying to break contact for the 3rd time tonight, but it's so hard, he's already taken her on a vacation and it broke me.  I wish I could just move on, I'm reading tons on self help, I'm even praying again and I haven't been a practicing Catholic in years, but nothing is working.

I held up the piece of paper and said, ""We clear what I mean, right?"" to which he had the realization that I was flirting and awkwardly told me he wasn't gay (We have a mutual friend, so he thought I was just being friendly).

He wants to be a stay at home dad. 


He wants to date like 5 years before marriage. 


He's never had sex before ever. 


There where tons of photos of porn on his phone and on his computer. 


At the end of the date we started to make-out and he was getting a little grabby.


Long story short, I'm looking for a relationship but am really turned off by these crazy requirements of his.


Have never met a gay person like this before. I'm 27, hes 20.


I don't know if his parents are just really religious and have brainwashed him or if this is his own original thought process.


I probably won't see him again purely because of this :/. It's a shame because I thought he was a really cool guy.
