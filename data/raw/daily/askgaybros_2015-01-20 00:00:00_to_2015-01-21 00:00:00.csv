Are you supposed to use your fingers first to get a ""feel""? So is that for stretching the anus? Shouldn't the guy being penetrated do anal stretching by himself beforehand to prepare himself?

When you insert your penis into an anus, don't you need lube? What if you don't use lube, can you still do it? Isn't the inside of the anus like a castle full of anal lube?

When you insert it, you're supposed to go slowly right? Isn't it true you can't go fast because it would hurt and cause tearing?

Isn't it dangerous to not wear a condom? Won't fecal matter get into your penis hole? 

No matter what, is it true that there will be some bad smell?

Is it okay to cum inside the guy without a condom? Or will the semen be stuck in there and absorb into the skin? Is that how STD's happen?

What is the difference between a man's anus and a woman's anus other than a prostate?

When you penetrate, do you ALWAYS manage to touch the wall in front of the prostate? Is that the main goal? Is it even possible to touch the prostate?

Do scented lubes help deal with the smell, if there is any?

When the penetration is done, is sex over? Because his dick is covered in fecal matter? Should he wash it first? 

Is there a lot of scat when doing anal sex? Or just a tiny bit?

Thanks.

So I'm a 21 year old male in university. I went through high school always having crushes on girls and being attracted to them. The thought of gay relationships never even crossed my mind. Very rarely, I'd sometimes get a 'twinge' in my penis seeing something homoerotic (usually just a guy with a nice ass or something lol). I could always recognize other guys as being attractive of course, but I never ever felt gay.

I have been self-conscious about being skinny for a long time and might have body dysmorphia and so I'd sometimes Google famous guys whose body frames I thought were similar and compare myself to them and I've done this more often as I picked up working out last year. After a while, it made me question my sexuality. I wasn't sure whether I was attracted to dominant, athletic men purely due to sexuality or because of my own self-loathing and need to compare. This weekend, me and my friends tried shrooms (my first time). I had a great time and felt incredibly confident and like a kid again. During the comedown we were all just sitting in a room talking. My emotions were so charged, the thoughts of my depression and sexual orientation were hooking into my brain and I felt I had to get it out there because it seemed like poison inside me. So I told everybody there about my depression, and a while later brought one of my buddies to my room to tell him I thought I was bisexual and that one of our friends (who I go to gym with and talk about girls with) was somebody I'd once fantasized about. I eventually told him too, which might've been a mistake (though I don't think it's at all romantic, I never implied it and am just worried I could've left that whole fact out and kept it less awkward).

I've since told my best friends back home and one of my sisters over texts and phone calls. I've never been with a guy to any degree. I've had sex with a few girls and enjoyed it (both the sex and companionship lying in bed after), though I have a serious difficulty talking to girls unless I'm feeling confident. Even while questioning my sexuality, I continue to check out girls and fantasize about them, though I'm aware this might just be my own social conditioning (and that could apply to to me feeling 'heteroromantic'). Though I have those questioning thoughts when I'm sober or high, whenever I'm drunk or rolling on M I only have eyes for women (and interestingly, during the shrooms trip I was always having visions of women and had a strong urge to go to the strip club). I have mostly straight guy friends and my only gay friend (who was my roommate last year) is not 'stereotypical'. When I watch porn, I had always watched female porn. I always graduated through categories and would sometimes have an 'Asian phase', 'ebony phase', etc. Recently, I would get off on mature porn simply because the idea of a older women seducing a younger guy like me seemed so different and hot. I just recently tried gay porn for the first time and did cum. I tried watching lesbian porn after and it felt like I had to work harder to cum.

Am I bi? Am I clinging to the idea that some part of me still likes women (I've heard bisexuality described here as potentially being 'gay training wheels')? Am I just attracted to things that feel like I shouldn't be attracted to them like they're taboo or something?

So I wanted to some feedback. Kinda of feeling down. 

I (31) met this guy (26) on Tinder. We chatted and I asked him out for drinks. He seemed into it. We met had some beers and had very good conversation for a couple hours. I am usually the one that goes in for the kiss but I was not sure he was feeling it towards the end so I thought to myself that I would just give him a hug. 

I lean in to hug him and he kisses me. Which was a pleasant surprise.  We leave and he texts me a smiley face. The next day I text him saying I had a good time and asking if he wants to go out the following week. He agrees rather emphatically. 

I got back to him about 4-5 days later because I was really busy at work and other stuff. In the meantime I know he was busy with school starting up. So I get back to him by messaging him saying something along the lines of ""Hey! did you still want to go out with me again?"" No response - but he has that thing on iMessage so I saw that he read it.

I message him the following day saying something alone the lines of if he is still interested let me know. He reads it but does not respond.

I was not really invested in this guy, but we had some chemistry he is cute and I thought he liked me. What is this even about? Do you guys feel like I did something wrong?  **EDITED:** to say "" I was **not** really invested in this guy""

This has sort of damaged my self-confidence. I am already not a super confident person but I always take these things so personally. It would be nice to at least hear ""well I thought about it and Im not that into you"" or something rather than floating in space wondering.

Ive had a couple situations also where Ive spoken to guys on apps and they are super friendly, seemingly into me, asking to meet up. Then they suddenly stop talking to me. Like just ignore everything I say but not block me. Maybe at least 3 different guys I can think of. 

To top it off I spoke to a gay friend of mine who is quite a bit younger than me and he said that this has not happened to him. I don't know... I feel like I am tying my personal self-worth into this type of thing.

I need some help thinking through a situation I'm in love with my newly out fraternity brother.  Let's call him Kevin. 

I've had feelings for Kevin for years. But he was always questionable if he was gay. I'm older (26) and he's younger (21) but we have known each other for a few years now because I stayed at the same university for grad school and have been active with our fraternity. I'm also open with my sexuality and here lately he has been asking me for help with his. He finally feels comfortable calling himself gay but is very slowly coming out to others. Kevin and I talk through many different situations that he is having as he is coming out. Before we talked about his sexuality, we talked a lot about many other things. Mostly student leadership things as we are both very involved on campus. We are really close and now I think he sees me as a mentor. Not only for his school leadership roles but also for help coming out. Part of us growing so close is that we spend a lot of time together. We'll just hang out and watch tv or go shopping together. We also constantly text and he'll call me just to say how his day is going and ask about mine. 

Should I risk what we have and tell him how I think we mesh so well and we could potentially share more? He's very mature, but I still feel I am too old for him. Also if it doesn't work out, then I would feel bad for not being able to support him as he comes out. 

UPDATE: decided that our friendship is more important and not to risk anything.  I'll be open to any advances he makes. But won't be making any myself.  Not happy about this, but it seems like the right decision. Thanks for all your help Bros!!! ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey Bros!

So I came out to her today. 

I started off by telling her about this person I've been dating. I told her some of the fun things we did and how cool they are. She said she was happy for me.
Then there was a pause. I said, ""This person is a guy"".

She looked right at me and started to tear up. She said, ""you look so frightened! It makes me sad to see you scared."" 
I then reached out to hug her and she hugged me back. She contined, ""This doesn't change anything.""

I started to cry and told her I loved her. She said 'I love you' back. Then we both stopped crying and went about our day. She's okay with me being gay and I had nothing to worry about with her.

If you are an American gay man, please consider participating in a survey on gay men’s beliefs, attitudes, and experiences. Most social science research focuses on heterosexual people’s experiences, thus less is known about those of gay men. I invite you to share your views by clicking this [link](https://qtrial2013.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_7U68yQLwkUYTvnL) to complete the survey. It will take approximately 30 minutes of your time.  

To show my appreciation for your participation in my research, I will enter you into a raffle to win one of several $20 Amazon.com gift cards. All that is needed for the raffle is your email address, which will be kept separately from your responses. All responses to the survey are anonymous. Please consider participation in this survey to help me attempt to create new knowledge about our experiences.

&lt;p&gt;If you are an American gay man, please consider participating in a survey on gay men’s beliefs, attitudes, and experiences. Most social science research focuses on heterosexual people’s experiences, thus less is known about those of gay men. I invite you to share your views by clicking this &lt;a href=""https://qtrial2013.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_7U68yQLwkUYTvnL""&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to complete the survey. It will take approximately 30 minutes of your time.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To show my appreciation for your participation in my research, I will enter you into a raffle to win one of several $20 Amazon.com gift cards. All that is needed for the raffle is your email address, which will be kept separately from your responses. All responses to the survey are anonymous. Please consider participation in this survey to help me attempt to create new knowledge about our experiences.  &lt;/p&gt;

Porn has started to bore me lately and I don't really care for playing with my toys so I'd really like to be able to orgasm without touching my dick.

Sometimes (like tonight) I've been able to find that *sweet spot* (I assume it's the prostate I'm hitting - idk) that'll drive me crazy, make me precum like mad, and get me to the point just before orgasm. My problem is I can't get past that last hurdle, every time I get to the point that I'm about to orgasm I just can't get over it and the worst part of it is **you know it's going to be good**. It's frustrating.

I've tried searching Google for answers but all I get links to are those stupid hypnosis videos, tutorial videos that tell you to **only** use your mind (I have a shit imagination - wanking and watching too much porn is probably why), and websites that only talk about the PC muscles in that they benefit sex. 

So does anyone know how to do it? Please help!


**TL;DR:** How do I shoot my clue goo without stimulation?

**EDIT** So um...just tried doing it again and just had a full body orgasm but with no ejaculate, so I'm guessing that's a success? Nevermind, if you still have tips for future reference (and anyone else wanting to learn) that'd be great!

Things he does or doesn't do, I won't go into specifics. My question is - from your experience, how often is it appropriate to call your partner out on something and create the awkward 'serious-talk' situation? While I want to be able to discuss things that bother me with him, I don't want to always come off as the boyfriend who was initially fun and sexy but eventually morphed into the clingy, crazy, possessive psycho (please forgive my wording, I'm using exaggerated language to make a point).

Here are my conflicting thoughts that I have regarding this.

1. If I don't call him out on stuff, that makes me a pussy and he's walking all over me.

2. If I do call him out on stuff, it makes me look whiney and insecure which is the least attractive thing.

3. Half of the issues that I want to raise with him may actually be more reflective of personal feelings that I am projecting onto him, so it's my responsibility to grow and deal with it internally.

4. Too much fighting can lead to a total lack of fun and defeats the point of being in a relationship.

5. Fighting, while awkward, can help create sexual tension. If no disagreements happen, boredom can be imminent.

6. There's no difference to be made either way, and no point thinking about it,  since men will be men and they're just going to do what they want anyway.

I know I'm not providing much detail. That's because I'm less concerned about specific advice on my own situation, and more curious about your personal experiences regarding this dilemma and the balance of 'don't-do-that' VS 'i'm-okay-with-that'.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been in a happy relationship for about a year, but of course there are certain things that annoy me about my partner.

I ( 29/M) started looking around this sub to try to get a better handle on my crazy weekend. Figured I might as well just post. Everyone involved here is 29 years old.


Me and 2 friends were hanging out just drinking and chilling at a bar. We ended up getting really hammered. Sometime later when we were all pretty much out of it, and walking home, my one friends (J) made a move on me. It took a few minutes to figure out what the hell he was doing. He was basically just trying to hug me and then kiss my neck. My other friend (C) was just laughing and kind of encouraging it. Eventually I grabbed J by his arms and pushed him away, holding him away from me. I told J to relax and asked wtf. I have had suspicions about them before, so I was trying to figure out if I was misreading the situation (keep in mind I was wasted) 


C immediately got somewhat defensive about it all, asking me what I was suggesting. I told him what  I thought, that J and C had some type of sexual relationship going on. C denied it at first. But then J went to C and kind of started humping him. C just laughed and said to cool it. Then J came back to me and tried hugging me again, until C said ""you need to stop"". C was less wasted then J and eventually he admitted to it all, saying he figured I knew already, which in hindsight, i guess i kind of did. He said he was hesitant to it all at first, but that now he loves it and it's more fun than I could imagine. He said things are mostly as I think they are + blowies. He mentioned watching sports or gaming, except there's brojobs thrown in.


I have never done anything with a guy before, but I have absolutely no problem with it. Just not my cup of tea-bags

Here are my issues though:

1. Both of these guys have girlfriends.This means they are cheating. I don't like this (obviously) but C says he doesn't think of it as cheating in the traditional sense. I called BS on that but apparently a lot of guys don't really consider this type of thing cheating according to C. Can anyone comment on the other side of the argument?  


2. Looking back at the last couple years, and thinking more about the people in our social circle, and those have left it or joined it, as well as other friends, I am left wondering how often this type of thing happens? My gay friend has said many times that it would blow my mind how many ""straight"" guys do this type of shit. When he was in college he would often give ""straight"" guys beejers. I find myself suspicious now that a lot of my friends might be into it. I am almost certain that at least 2 guys who are friends with me, C and J  must be into this too just by putting pieces together from the past.  I kind of feel like my eyes have been opened to something I had no idea existed. I always knew there were way more guys out there who were gay or bi or whatever, and I knew the younger generations are increasingly open about it, but now I am thinking it's way more common than myself or a lot of people realize. 


3. As stated, we were all wasted. I don't remember everything we talked about. I'm pretty sure C likely remembers more than I do. J probably has no recollection though. It's been 2 weeks now without any mention of it. We have all hung out a few times since. At first I figured I would wait until C and I were alone, and having beers to bring it up. But now, I am thinking that I shouldn't. thoughts?


 As time has passed, the moral issues of this have boiled to the surface. They are cheating. They made a move on me and they are likely to do the same thing to others. If one of their gf's finds out, and it blows up, I do not want any part of that drama. I also feel unsettled knowing what they are doing to their gf's. Are they even worth being friends with? If  it blows up, am I going to be accused of being involved? Pretty sure my wife would believe me, but it would still be problematic. She is good friends with C's gf so if i told her about this, she would certainly tell her. So can't talk about this with anyone except a few thousand people on reddit.

We met our senior year in high school. I went away to college while he stayed in our home town.  After I graduated, we moved to the biggest city closest to our hometown. We came from different backgrounds and still are very different people. He likes sports. I will watch with him but it isn't for me. I like exploring cities and he goes along to make me happy. He is in construction and I am in business. 

Now we're old. We have a dog. We've been together since 1985.  Other than a couple of indiscretions that were very challenging to our relationship, we've been monogamous since the summer of 1985. We created/signed power of healthcare documents about 10 years ago. The house is in my name but I'm worried about him getting kicked out if I die. 

Getting married is a big deal. I love him but maybe not enough to get married plus I don't want/need to broadcast our relationship to the world or to our hometown about 4 hours away. I'm not closeted but don't want to make a big deal out of it. 

Shouldn't I be CRAZY in love with him? I always thought being in love was supposed to be all fireworks and party favors. I was crazy for him in the late 1980s but now I just appreciate him, trust him and enjoy spending time with him. Should I wait for or seek someone more compatible, maybe more intellectually stimulating?  Shouldn't I be more in love with everything he does/is?  

Since we were in our twenties, I've joked and said I'd marry him when we reached 50. I'll be 50 this year. We live in Ohio without gay marriage. He wants to get married but we stopped talking about it 10 years ago because I would always try to joke my way out of the discussion. Since it won't count here, it will probabbly cost of a few bucks to hire an attorney to make any of the provisions legal Ohio.

&lt;p&gt;Getting married is a big deal. I love him but maybe not enough to get married plus I don&amp;#39;t want/need to broadcast our relationship to the world or to our hometown about 4 hours away. I&amp;#39;m not closeted but don&amp;#39;t want to make a big deal out of it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shouldn&amp;#39;t I be CRAZY in love with him? I always thought being in love was supposed to be all fireworks and party favors. I was crazy for him in the late 1980s but now I just appreciate him, trust him and enjoy spending time with him. Should I wait for or seek someone more compatible, maybe more intellectually stimulating?  Shouldn&amp;#39;t I be more in love with everything he does/is?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we were in our twenties, I&amp;#39;ve joked and said I&amp;#39;d marry him when we reached 50. I&amp;#39;ll be 50 this year. We live in Ohio without gay marriage. He wants to get married but we stopped talking about it 10 years ago because I would always try to joke my way out of the discussion. Since it won&amp;#39;t count here, it will probabbly cost of a few bucks to hire an attorney to make any of the provisions legal Ohio.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What should I do?  I&amp;#39;m leaning toward spending the money on the lawyers and not actually getting gay married. &lt;/p&gt;

When flaccid I have pretty good coverage but it doesn't completely hang over the tip so it leaves the tip a little exposed. 

I've been reading up that an uncut penis is supposed to have a glossy and pink look to it, and the foreskin is supposed to glide over the penis because of the natural oils that the foreskin makes. Mine looked kind of dull and dried kind of like a circumcised one. I read this is due to over washing and using soaps on the penis which isn't supposed to be done(only supposed to use water under the foreskin) because the skin under the foreskin isn't like the skin anywhere else in your body, it's a membrane and supposed to be somewhat moist/lubricated ( like your eyes, vagina,mouth, etc).

While in my early teens I did have pretty good foreskin coverage and I remember my head being shiny and healthy looking and I want to get it back to looking like that. 

How do you uncut Gaybros wash/care for your uncut penises? Do u use soap? Or just water?
