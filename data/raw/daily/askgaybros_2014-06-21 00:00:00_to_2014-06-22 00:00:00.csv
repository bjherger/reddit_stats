Random thoughts on a Friday night, felt the need to talk about it.
So. I don't know in which category I really am. I have really bits of muscles (small biceps, invisible abs), I guess I'm a hybrid of skinny/otter, and a bit of beard too (though filled with holes lol). ANYWAY.

The thing is, I'm sexually attracted to beefy guys with beard. The classic. Not necessarily the super cut type, but the strong, hairy, bearded, typical lumberjack type is an instant win with me *everytime*. That said, I try hard to not have a fixed type, so I've tried for years to find a good balance of something both good physically and psychologically for me, tried many things, but I'm having a hard time. Either I'll find someone very attractive without a charming personality, or I'll find the other (lacking *the thing that turns me on*), but finding someone with both has been so far unsuccessful.

And this raises some question. When I browse dating apps/websites, whenever I come across somebody of my taste, either he'll be into muscle too, or sport, or he'll be a bottom (which I think I am?, still butt-virgin), or he'll be overconfident or he'll have the classic headline ""healthy mind in a healthy body"". The latter causing an issue.

I'm an artist, I draw, build things in 3D, draw comic strips, I write novels, I have a great sense of humor, intend to work in the video game industry... And as an artist (I'm really not trying to find excuse lol), I'm disorganized, clumsy, insecure, lost in my ideas and I forget sometime I have to jog outside. And I have my share of melancholy too. I'm also seeing a therapist everyweek, which I'm kind of ashamed of. And to make things better, I also have a [Pectus excavatum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pectus_excavatum), which is obvious once you see it. I'm really complexed with it.
All this make me feel invisible to my type. I know I'm good looking or I can be to an extend for my type, but sexy, a turn on with my clothes off, that's another story.

Is there possible for someone like me to find a good ""lumberjack""? Although I'm not into sport, sometime moody, etc? To find someone who's not a ""I LIKE TO SHOW OFF SHIRTLESS"" or too proud of himself?
 I might sound picky, but I'm really not, I give a fair chance to everybody, but I'd just like for once having someone *of my taste as a whole*, with a golden heart, and I just don't know how to find that nor if it even exists lol.

**Bottom line**: What type of guy a beefy man (with a beard) like?

It is about grindr. 

I was talking to this one kid (guy A, 23 years old), he hit me up because he liked my profile and that I was looking for something serious. We have been talking for a few, skype, and text.  Only met once. We had a conversation about how it would be nice to have a friend first build a foundation together and possible grow into something stronger.  However I know he is attracted to me as I am to him. We flirt occasionally but in the back of my head I know we shouldn't mess around because I would like to be this guys friend and grow to something more.

Guy B, I have been talking to him longer lives in a different town. I met him for dinner so we ate and spoke. He is 35 years old. We ended up talking about the app. Showing me guys he hooked up with in my town and guys he wants to hookup with and whom he has plans with.  
One giye that I seen on his list was the guy that i was talking to befofe through messaging, skyping (guy A ). He had plans to meet him today but the plans fell through. He said the guy randomly stopped messaging him back. He showed me the message and his last message was exactly the same time as guy A and I hung out. After we hung out guy A stopped responding to guy B.

The awkward question, do I have the right to ask guy B not to reach out to guy A as in a sexual manner to mess around with?

The point here is,  REQUIRE respect from people. Otherwise you're letting people degrade you and you're  showing other people that you're fine with being disrespected.

I have lost respect for her, and I'll never speak to this woman again, lest she shows respect. She is the reason we fight for our rights.

What are some gay apps that allow for longer, elaborate profiles? Thanks!

I'm not looking for one-offs. I'm looking for friendship (both platonic/with benefits), chats and relationships, basically strings.

Some apps and websites I've been using and my opinions:

Grindr: most guys on this but people are just too horny, character limit sucks, shows only 200 guys

Scruff: generous character limit which I love, but I'm young, not a bear or muscled so I don't get a lot of attention

Hornet: pathetic character limit and functions just like a less buggy grindr and you can load unlimited guys

Gayromeo: I like this best, it has an app and allows for really long profiles

Jackd: I've had problems with bots on jackd but I like that it allows long profiles

Tinder: Cruel, superficial app, but I find comfort in the fact that when a match does occur, I can safely assume that both of us are into each other. It could use a longer character limit. Being tied with facebook accounts makes conversations on Tinder much civil, but people can be so shy to initiate and reply on Tinder.

OKCupid: Best in the dating game, but I feel really really inferior when I look at others' profiles, some guys are just too good to be true: great job, good looking, more educated and cultured, fascinating background, all in one package. It's a barrier I really have to overcome myself.
