I'm a 22 year old male gay university student, and my mum died of cancer after a few years of battle, some months before christmas. I miss her so much that words wouldn't do it justice, I came out to her when I was 15, I could always speak to her about anything, and the only one I could.

I've always some problems with my own self-worth, but as with many people, this improved a lot when I started university and was helped a lot by making some absolutely amazing friends.

Lately though I feel it's returned somewhat, and morphed into some odd form of social anxiety. I don't fear social situations at all, but what happens is that for example after a friday night out, I'll the morning after get these thoughts, that the people I've been speeking to that evening, thinks I'm an ass.

I don't really know why I get these thoughts, what is in my mind is generally simple things like, ""Did I seem interested enough in what that person had to say"" or ""Did I remember to maintain eye-contact"" (The eye-contact thing may sound odd, but my mind has a tendency to stray, so I have to consciously think about it).

I realize that all this is probably in my mind, as people always say I'm great to talk to and attentive. It pretty much only happens, when I've been out drinking too.


As for positive things, I've joined two summer sports teams that start next week and I'm REALLY looking forward to it, it'll be amazing to do some more outside things, here in the summer!



It's also worth mentioning that I've been to a therapist 5 times since my mum died, but I never brought this up with her (don't ask why, I didn't think it was as big of an issue, as it apparently is).

Anyway, I guess I'm just looking for someone on the outside, to tell me it's all in my head.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yo&lt;/p&gt;

I was totally upfront in a jokingly way about me making out with a lot of straight guys (which I think is what really sealed it). I also have a theory that if you're an attractive guy (I hate to call myself this but people, including this guy, have said it), you can sway a guy into rethinking his sexuality if you pursue enough.

And so I guess the question is... Should I really be pursueing? I've read enough of these posts to know the long and treacherous road that is 'converting' a 'straight' guy. I don't want to, but I feel like if I continue that he'll keep on doubting himself. I think its like, I want the cake and I want to eat it too.

For selfish reasons, I want to have a guy to cuddle, kiss and whatever. He says he enjoyed it and a bit after when the party was over he texted (still drunkely) saying one day he would want to see how the rest of the night would have ended. But then again, I'm remembering the girl involved. They had gotten almost to 4th base (Sounds High Schooley I know btw I'm 19 in college), but she didnt want to, then she kinda of stopped talking to him. 

Is this whole experience with me just a rebounding? What are y'all's experiences with this? I really have no one else to talk to like this so if you replied I'd really appreciate your opinion.

&gt;while we were upstairs making out, a friend of mine (part owner of the house) came up and found us out. He wasn't supposed to see us so I made sure (through some negotiations and such) he wouldn't ever tell anyone.

Met a guy on OKCupid, he noticed I plucked a sentence from his profile, we promised not to call the OK Cupid police if I appologized. He had good humor, looks blah blah blah. We flirt non sexual for a few days, move to skype so we can chat faster.

He Dotas, I dota! We play lots of games, get more comfy with each other, then he says he would be interested in meeting if I am. I say sure, but I'm shy as shit, yet willing, so name a place. We run into that ""I'm okay with wherever your okay with"". Round and round we go then he calls it a night, we agree to think about it.

X amount of time/days whatever later, playing some dota, we both realized we where asking for 5 min to fap. Talk fap stuff, I mention my having a dudes nude profile, stupid me it was relatively same OKCupid name, so he finds it. Red faced all around, oh lawd. I make it private for members only, and I have benefits on the site so I can see who sees me, so I know that my body wont be seen unless its in person thankfully, now. 

X amount of time later meeting up comes up again, we dicuess places, I say I'm okay with wherever, and since I don't live in the city and hes in school, since I have a car I'll make the trip to wherevers within distance of his place so he doesn't have to go out of his way since traveling is easier, yet longer, for me. And I really don't care about an hour drive if it works so why not. He names some plaza place, I ask where it is, he says ""Toronto"", I say ""Thats kinda vague, whats it near/by/an address"" he says, to my shock, ""Just fucking google it"". I was in the military, swear a lot but not at people, he has sworn a total of twice online, so I take that as hes angry/pissed/whatever. I google it, ask if theres a place inside he likes, coffee shop whatever, says doesn't matter, hes tired, goes to bed.

Talks since OKcupid get smaller and smaller as this all goes on, thought we had talked it all out before meeting, gets more one worded answers, from an English major no less, and then boom. I ask if he has plans for the weekend. ""Yes"" (Like do I really need to ask a follow  up question ""what are those plans?"") Clearly the one worded answers mean he doesn't want to talk or is busy or pissed, something isn't awesome and if I have to ask 3 questions to get an answer to the first, so I play some games. Ask about his steam name, its a reference to him being a ""lonely horny mammal"", I say lol.

He asks if I do five min later, I say cousins wedding yada yada. Since he asked, I asked again, so what are you plans? ""Going out with the bf""

Wut...

I know he doesn't owe me his life details or whatever, but all these months talking, flirting, discussing everything, HIM SEEING ME NAKED OH FACEPALM and talking meeting up, and hes found a guy while we do all this? I went from having my heart skip a beat any time anyone logged on skype or steam, to fuck this guy, to why is your steam name a reference to you being lonely if you have a bf, to I don't even want to do anything anymore.


tl;dr (dont blame you for skipping: Hit it off with a dude, thinks get really good albeit just online, discuss meeting that goes no where, hes lonely and horny but also has a boyfriend.

Ask about his steam name, its a reference to him being a &amp;quot;lonely horny mammal&amp;quot;, I say lol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He asks if I do five min later, I say cousins wedding yada yada. Since he asked, I asked again, so what are you plans? &amp;quot;Going out with the bf&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wut...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know he doesn&amp;#39;t owe me his life details or whatever, but all these months talking, flirting, discussing everything, HIM SEEING ME NAKED OH FACEPALM and talking meeting up, and hes found a guy while we do all this? I went from having my heart skip a beat any time anyone logged on skype or steam, to fuck this guy, to why is your steam name a reference to you being lonely if you have a bf, to I don&amp;#39;t even want to do anything anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tl;dr (dont blame you for skipping: Hit it off with a dude, thinks get really good albeit just online, discuss meeting that goes no where, hes lonely and horny but also has a boyfriend. Cut him out of my life? I don&amp;#39;t think &amp;quot;lets be friends&amp;quot; works when one person likes the other...&lt;/p&gt;

I am 24 years old, 291 pounds, black, 5foot11 with an average sized cock, which I guess makes me too absolutely ugly to even speak to to gay guys. I'm not socially awkward, not shy at all, I love meeting new people and hanging out and having fun with people.

I have had an OKCupid account for almost 3 years. My account has over 20 pictures, always updated, and contains language that really explains my chill demeanor and niceness. When I read my profile, I think I'm the perfect guy, but I have literally never received a message on OKCupid. I have messaged hundreds of people and have never received a reply, not even once. 

I have been on grindr since 2010. I have a standard pic of me smiling while on a nature walk. My description says that I'm looking for friends to hang out and chill with, and not adverse to fun sometimes too. All of the stats are filled, etc. I have literally never received 1 message on Grindr. I have sent messages to people in several cities/states that I have visited, and not even one person has replied. 

Rinse and repeat for Growlr, Scruff, Jack'd, boyahoy, every other gay social site/app you can think of.

On adam4adam, there was one guy who messaged me because he wanted to be gang banged by a group of black guys. He was HIV positive (not on meds) and a total pig bottom which I am not into because I care about my sexual health. Otherwise, I have literally never gotten a message on adam4adam. 

I've been in gay bars all over the united states, Canada, UK, Sweden and Germany, and not a single guy would converse with me for more than 60 seconds before they find any reason to get the hell away from me.

I have [sort of] dated 2 guys in my life, though I use that term loosely. The first guy I met in 9th grade, we shared some cultural similarities and listened to the same type of music. We somehow ended up sleeping together for an entire year but he never wanted anyone to know about us, so it never went anywhere. He found it convenient that we had things in common so having sex with each other was also convenient? I dunno, I just went with it, at least I was getting laid. He ended up moving to another state and cutting all contact when me then. The second guy, we dated for almost 5 years and had sex once in those 5 years. He openly told me that he was truly not attracted to me but that he wanted to spend his life with me because he loves my personality. How did this go on for 5 years? I'm not quite sure, but after being consistently cheated on, lied to, made to feel unwanted, going to bed alone every night, I left him and I'm now single again. I'm pretty sure he only stayed for my money, which is another hurt altogether. I'm still shocked and hurt today that he was so willing to hurt me for so long. 

In my professional life, I have a very good job and am a few thousand away from having a 6-figure salary. Of course I don't flaunt this, most of my earnings go into savings because I'd like to retire early. I live the life of someone who makes about 35k per year. I drive America's top selling sedan although I could afford much more. My coworkers absolutely love me, I get along great with everyone, I'm the star of the company I work for and very well respected there. In my personal life, all of my friends love me and we always hang out and do fun things together, we all love each other  very much. 

Now, I know the first thing you guys will say is ""lose weight and gain confidence,"" however, over the course of several years I have fluctuated between 200-370 pounds. Even in the years that I was my lowest weight ever, I still never got a single spec of attention from any other guy on this planet. 

Although I am very financially successful, have very successful friendships, a great career, I'm very nice and giving, I give back to the community, all the things it takes to be a decent human being, there is not even one gay guy on this planet who finds me attractive enough to even reply to a friendly message I send them. Sometimes they just block me right off the bat. 

When I look in the mirror, I think I am a beautiful young model citizen, and if I met myself I would want to spend the rest of my life with me. I'm very happy with who I am, but other gay guys don't even get a chance to know me because they won't talk to me.

I am generally a very happy person, but All of this sometimes gets me to my lowest point. Sometimes [not often] I will stay in my room and lay in bed for days being depressed and never wanting to see another guy on this earth. I'm pretty sure my libido has disappeared, not even hot porn can help me get hard anymore after going through this for so many years. I've come to the conclusion that I am going to die alone with no one to share my happiness and money with. I guess I'm just that ugly. It gets better, unless you're ugly, fat, or black. 

**TL;DR - I'm so unattractive that not even one guy on this planet is attracted to me.**

I need your advice. I am 20 years old, I'm in a relationship with the most amazing guy. It's my first significant relationship and we've been together for over a year and a half.
For the first 9 months or so I topped exclusively. As we became more relaxed about sex we swapped over occasionally. And then more often. And now our roles are pretty much completely reversed. He tops and I bottom. It's great, in many ways it seems like a better fit. We have both admitted on separate occasions to liking things better this way. Most of the time I don't feel any different or think about myself any differently for being the bottom. My boyfriend certainly doesn't. And most of the time when we're having sex I am completely 100% okay with being a bottom.

And yet, sometimes I feel ashamed for liking it. Often after dom-sub style sex I feel terrible. Like I am somehow lesser.(Just to be clear, this isn't at the hands of an abusive boyfriend it's all very vanilla and he stops if he or I gets uncomfortable) I feel shame for taking it and liking it, but of course, it's this very shame that makes the sex so good.

I don't understand it. I know I am not supposed to feel this way. I am okay with who I am.
Rationally I know that what I happen to like in bed in no way affects my value as an individual but on some deep visceral level I know that it does and I feel guilty for thinking this.
I'm not even sure that it's a question of emasculation that has me feeling so bad about myself, I'm not a manly man.

I don't really know how to get over something that seems so deep-rooted and irrational. Is this a common problem?

I just turned 21 and am still completely a virgin with guys. I've gone almost all the way with girls in the past, but I know for a fact I am definitely gay. I've been a bit late to come out, (didn't tell my parents until recently), and I think the main reason has been that it has been just so comfortable to blend in and pretend to be straight, even while being unhappy.

I finally came out mainly because I don't want to live the rest of my life alone. I want to eventually fall in love with someone who will love me too. Now at the same time, from time to time I have really wanted to at least just hookup, in a way to fully prove to myself that I'm gay. (Even though I want to say I have completely accepted it, there probably is a small part deep down that still won't believe). Additionally, I just want to feel what it's like to actually be with someone.

I'm not unattractive, and I definitely receive messages from people on different apps about hooking up, however whenever I almost get to the point of setting it up and the hookup seems like it might actually happen, I almost lose complete interest in the person, finding some excuse or fault for not wanting to do it. I feel like I'm starting to just get in a stagnant downward spiral. Part of me really wants to hookup, while the other part is terrified of the unknown, stds, and regret (I mean obviously I'd use a condom, but that still doesn't completely protect against herpes, etc, and theres always a chance the condom could break, etc). While I would love to wait until I find someone who I actually care for, I realize that this is pretty unrealistic thinking. I'm so sick of my own insecurity with who I really am, and I really am sick of being afraid of sex.

So, should I just have sex with the next person I find attractive who also wants to hookup with me, or will I just end up regretting the experience?

Kind of embarrassing asking this... But my boyfriend is pretty huge. I'm no stranger to bottoming, but in all the hookups and boyfriends I've had (not thaaaat many, but a fair amount), he's the largest I've ever experienced. In fact, the largest I've seen and that includes quite a few pornos I've seen. Up until now I've only been the top, and he's mainly a bottom but he's expressed a lot of interest with me bottoming, which I'm fine with, because I'm versatile.


So that being said, my question is, is there any tips? I know to use plenty of lube, relax, and go slow.. But I don't like being fingered, and we don't have any toys or anything like that. Maybe some good lube suggestions or techniques?

So I'm a shy gaybro. Always have been, always will be...and because of this I have a hard time asking guys out. Well know fact in my circles of friends.

So cut to last night, I'm doing some theater stuff and I go out with the cast and crew (as you do)

Another friend (also a gaybro) and I are talking and he asks me how I feel about one of the actors in the show. I'm been not so secretly crushing on the actor for a while, and I let him know. So I figure he's asking because maybe the actor said something about me.

I was drunk, and spilled to my friend. And it turns out he was asking because he was about to pursue the actor himself. He apologizes to me as he was thinking about this for a while and he'd already been talking to our mutual friends about it. 
In a way, I think he felt like he was going to soften the blow?

He then goes on about how he's a ""bad friend"" and I'm so mad at him for this.
Being drunk and not wanting to deal with crying friend, I told him I was fine...but I may not feel the same way when I'm not drunk.

I'm that person who will put others feelings before my own...which is stupid of me.

Needless to say, they are now at least going on one date. 
And I still feel like somehow he should've let me know sooner...? Should I tell him that I feel hurt because of this? I guess I don't navigate emotions very well.

I work in the trades, drive a truck, like old country music, and wear lots of jeans and flannel. When I look at established communities in the gay scene, I look most like bears or cubs. 

Only, my experience of bear bars has been high ego older bears on the prowl. Granted my experience has been limited, but my easy going introverted self did not feel at ease. Also, I tend to be attracted to guys less hairy than me. I also present very butch but would date pretty much anyone regardless of butch/fem presentation. 

Basically. I feel like a tick all of the boxes of a bear cub which is totally awesome. I've dunked my toe into the bear culture pool and didn't really like it.
