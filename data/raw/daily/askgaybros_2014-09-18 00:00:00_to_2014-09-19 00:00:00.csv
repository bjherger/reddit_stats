Problem is, the damn boyfriend is a sphynx in disguise and doesn't want to admit he loves throwing me around and tossing me riddles to answer like I am in some episode of Sherlock. 

He sent me: 

Him: Baby

Me: Yeah?

Him: Keep being you

Me: That's the plan! :D
Why do you say that? (Am I doing something right?)

Him: Relationships are like flowers; they need to be watered if they are to grow. We water relationships with patience, clear communication, honesty, and care.  When all else fails, return to the roots, the things that made you fall in love in the first place.

Food for thought. Goodnight.

I'm married to my partner of 5 years -- we have been married for a little over 1 year now. He is a twink type, a good bit shorter than me, and has a cute, thin build. Physically, he is my type you could say. He is 9 years older than me, and he is HIV+ while I am HIV-. I am blood tested annually and swab tested every few months when I go with him to certain doctor appointments. I admit having some fear of becoming infected with HIV, despite my partner's impressively low viral load and strong T cell count. He is considered undetectable.

One issue is that lately we never have sex. This bothers me off and on. I am certain it bothers him far more then he lets on. When I think about why, I move immediately into blaming myself. When I think about how little interest I have in sex, I just want to hide away from my relationship because I know how I am making him feel rejected, unwanted, and not good enough. I feel like my low sex drive makes him feel these things, when truthfully it has nothing to do with him. However, I can't bring myself to say out loud that I am not interested in sex and that it's not his fault. We both seem to have settled for this being the elephant in the room that is not discussed.

I am often turned on by the thought of sex, and I watch porn once or twice a week. However, in any of my relationships, including with my husband but also with all of my prior relationships and past sexual partners, I am very excited about the thought of sex until it starts to actually happen, at which point I seem to lose almost all interest. I can fantasize about bottoming or topping or oral, but when it's time to actually have sex I just fizzle out. I can get hard and perform, but I'm just not that into it. I find that I just want it to be over with so I can go back to doing something else. I'm so familiar with how I feel terrible when I actually get into it that I avoid it altogether now. But then later I will have intense desires and thoughts and just go jerk off alone. I've never had any trouble getting off by myself.

I also have a big problem with being touched. If my partner touches my legs or torso too softly or seems like he's trying to tickle me (even though he never tries to tickle me) I feel this swelling uncomfortable feeling and usually jerk away or get angry. One time my partner tried to be sweet and hold me, and he grazed my leg with his hand. I lit up in a fit of rage and tackled him to the ground and yelled at him. I was so embarrassed, because the response was so irrational and made no sense. It is completely irrational but I can't seem to control it. I just know that I do not like anyone tickling me or getting too close physically. I have no idea where this comes from, but it has always been there. I can't even get a massage from a professional massage therapist because being touched will make me so upset and uncomfortable. I will squirm endlessly until I get up and leave the room.

Apart from these physical issues, my husband and I are well-connected. We communicate often, handle money very well together, take good and responsible care of our home, and are really there for one another during the hard times. We have good boundaries with one another and I have even been impressed by how we have accepted and weathered many changes in our relationship over these 5, almost 6 years of being together. We have each really grown as individuals, and we have done it together. I feel that we have a great blend of individuality and togetherness, and I love how we have learned to balance the two. But when it comes to being touched and to having sex, we miss each other. And we do not talk about these issues.

I don't know why we are so stuck. We aren't unhappy. We love one another. We have good trust in our relationship. We are just not physically and sexually intimate.

I've been approached to do a life model gig on a regular basis. Where basically i'd pose nude and let people draw me. The groups aren't fine art students though, it's like classy bachelorette parties. They get to sip on wine and each from platters while drawing/paint a naked dude in an art studio for a few hours before going out and continuing their antics. There would likely be whitty banter between model and patrons. There would be no phone cameras but a picture with the group at the end while in shorts. Also no touching or groping the model. Here's a good [article](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/14/fashion/bachelorette-parties-where-the-naked-man-doesnt-dance.html) describing it a little more.

I'd do once or twice every couple of weeks. Mostly for a pocket cash, partly as additional gym-motivation, partly as a general public presence comfort exercise. I'm also kind of curious how horrible / good the drawings turn out from these drunk ladies and possibly dudes in some instances.

So my questions for you r/askGaybros is... If you were out on a date with a guy and heard he did this, would it make you reconsider your interest in him? Is this basically make me a cheesy male stripper? One step above porn star? or is it just a funny side gig that wouldn't make you jealous? Is it first date conversation? Would  it be perceived as a ""look at me i'm a model"" ego?

The number of cute guys who walk into the store is never in short supply, and it's almost like going to a candy store for me since I work with walking the floors and helping the customers. However, my social game outside of helping people with books is piss poor and I either amuse customers, or creep them out. I'm pretty awkward. 

There was one guy that stood out to me though. I remember how intoxicated I was by his look. He did not look like anyone else on the campus and that's what drew me to him. He was also a customer I helped I in the beginning of this year and occupied my time for quite a while (he was looking up his schedule in the store on his phone but it had shitty reception) and I enjoyed how mellow he was. He was on my mind for a while and when I was thinking about him last Wednesday when I stepped out for a bit, he walked past me by chance. I kind of had to do a double take, and wanted to talk to him but he was heading towards class and I did not want to hold him up. I did however, clock the time that he was heading for class so that the next time I casually step out I could bump into him for a little light chat (that's not creepy, is it?)

So today was the day I decided to put that plan into motion, and it failed horribly. I got extremely nervous when I saw what looked like him walking with this girl, so I just nope'd past him. It was pretty lame of me and walking closer past the two they didn't even seem like they knew each other. It bummed me out beyond belief. I figured it just wasn't meant to be but I figured wrong way too fast.

Later on into the day I was coming back from the bathroom heading to my workplace and I noticed I was actually walking right behind him. I offered him to help out and I asked him how his summer was, and he ended up telling me about it as well as how stupid his professor was.  Here's where I ventured into awkward territory. After he asked my name and we re-introduced ourselves I asked him if he was free and wanted to go to lunch sometime. He said he'd drop by tomorrow and see what's up and that made me feel what I expressed in my title. Excited because I took a chance that seemed to be thrown at me by fate and went for it, nauseous because I hated how weird my interaction was and how I came off and I was so nervous, and doubtful because I don't know anything about this guy at all and I feel like he'll end up being straight and I'm tired of bringing my hopes up and having them crushed.

Now I don't want to be pessimistic but I am setting myself up for disappointment because I feel like if it's going to turn out the same way, then I might as well be prepared. I'm even thinking he might not show up but I don't want it to go there and I wouldn't be surprised if it does. Did I do the right thing by taking the chance or was I moving too fast? Also, what should I do if he does live up to his word, and what is the right mindset to have in this situation?

This is my first post here. I've been running this through my head for a couple months now, and it's starting to drive me crazy.

I've (25 yr old top)been with my BF , J(21 yr old bttm), for about 8 months.  We met on adam4adam and decided to meet up for a hookup. The sex was fantastic and we had the added benefit that we had a lot of shared interests. 

Fast forward to today. We've had sex a grand total of 4 times (since february, two of those times being 3somes).
 Now I know he a sexual individual, as He's got a pretty active tumblr porn blog, which he updates quite frequently. But whenever I attempt to get him going, he tells me he's ""just not feeling it"".

 I've tried to have conversations about what turns him on, or what he fantasizes about, but that all ways ends up with a generic few word answer and an end to the conversation. I've tried spontaneity,  being agressive/passive, being dom/sub. I've become versatile(before him I was a staunch top).

I guess I'm reaching the end of my wits here, as I can't for the life of me get a 21 yr old interested in sex.
