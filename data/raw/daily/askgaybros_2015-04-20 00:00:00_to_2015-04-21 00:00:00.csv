I feel I lost a lot of friends during the divorce because some of my Christian friends didn't know how to deal with a friend having a divorce. Then when I came out, I have felt so much more alone. I'm usually the one that people come to for advice and support, but feel pretty alone with a lot of this. 

I've been putting myself out there in person and on apps. I have made some good friends, but the culture here in St. Louis is difficult in my opinion. I feel too gay for the Christians and too Christian for the gays. I'm having a hard time meeting guys that want more than just hooking up.

He *regularly* browses this subreddit, so I figured this would be the best place to ask. I suppose I secretly want him to see this and figure out who it is, maybe it could be an ice breaker. 

He loves me so much, but the spark I felt when we first started dating just isn’t there anymore. He’s always smiling around me, and I just feel like I’m being a dismissive jerk most of the time. He takes me and my flaws and lives with them, even thrives by them, while I’m stuck nitpicking everything he does. I want to break up, but I want him to be happy; I don’t think he’d be happy with anyone but me. 

We started dating in college, 2 years before graduation. We lived together, commuted together, and got to know every aspect of each other. We’re perfect for each other, really, practically mirror images. We’re the kind of guys who are ***frequently*** mistaken for being brothers. It’s been nearly 3 years now, and the problem is that we’ve become so complacent with each other that he doesn’t stimulate me anymore, intellectually or otherwise. He doesn’t challenge me to try new things, or meet new people. He just sits there playing Civ V or redditing. He has aspirations, but zero motivation. It seems like everything we do now is only initiated on my end. Once started, he’ll keep it going if he enjoys it, but I always seem to have to be the one to make us do things.  This is very tiring, and just being around him is a huge drain on *my* motivation. 

It seems like a clear choice for me at least, break up and move on, but we have a joint bank account, we’re both on the lease, and he’s not working right now. We have some money saved up, but how would we split it? Neither of us make enough to afford our current apartment, and our lease isn’t up until Fall. His car doesn’t work great, and although he doesn’t use it, I still feel like I can’t abandon him without a functional car. We just started a garden together, and he seems to be really enjoying tending to it. I can’t just rip that away from him. 

I’m in such a bind here. I must be making him out to be a complete loser, but he’s such a sweetheart, and very emotional at times, so I know even mentioning a break up would crush him. I don’t know if he’d be able to move on with his life. I feel like I’m the last solid anchor in his life, and it would be the most selfish thing to leave him. But I need out...I really can’t keep doing this. I know it wouldn’t be my fault if he can’t get his life going post-relationship, but I still want to make sure he’s happy. 

Have any of you had experiences like this? How did it go when you finally had enough to call it quits? And regrets or things you wish happened differently?

Any advice is appreciated.

As we speak my landlady is cleaning out the spare room in my flat so that it can be rented out. She's got a person coming to look at the room tomorrow. It's not that I didn't see this coming, since technically I'm only renting my room, but I'm really struggling to deal with living with another person. The person who rented my room before was a friend of my fathers who said nobody rented the spare room in the past because it was too small and the flat itself is tiny (just has a small kitchen and bathroom). So I felt kind of safe under the impression that the landlady wouldn't rent out the spare room and I could keep having the flat to myself. Things have changed now.

Because of my personality disorder and depression I have an extremely difficult problem with living with other people in a houseshare/roomate setting, but I can't afford to rent my own place, this was why this room/flat was a great opportunity. I'm really sensitive and introverted and in the past it got me hospitalised because I was too scared to leave my bedroom for days and had to relieve myself in plastic bottles and nearly starved. I am receiving therapy but it can only help so much. I don't envision things getting as bad as that time but it will still overload me with heaps of stress having to share living space with someone again. Everything about it frightens me and always has my whole life. 

I just feel so powerless since all I can do is sit tight and try to cope. My world is already upside down and I'm trying to get my shit together this year and now this has happened. My landlady is so aloof and ignorant to what I'm going through, but it's not her fault, even though there are a few things going through my mind like:

* I bought the fridge, microwave and table and chairs from my fathers friend (the last tenant). They are mine: I own them. I don't think the landlady realises this and I feel offended that this stranger who is moving in is going to use the fridge etc when they're mine.

* The flat came with a limited amount of kitchen utensils. Just plates, bowls, a pot and a couple of frying pans. I bought my own cutlery, toaster, kettle and was going to buy more bits and pieces when I had the money. So basically same as above; new tenant is going to move in and use all my stuff. I feel like if I speak up about it I'll look like a dick and just make things more stressful for myself. But it doesn't seem fair.

I can't move out as I can't afford it and I'm in a good location for public transport, which I depend upon. I feel like confronting the landlady but I don't think it's going to stop any of this from happening and it might make me look stupid if I mention the fact that I own the fridge/microwave/table and some of the utensils and am being expected to share them with a stranger.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#39;t really gay/bro related.

I have a situation, a situation where I'm sure many of you guys have experience with. So it started out when this guy (we'll call him R) started talking to me on Jack'd. We're both in college, he's planning on getting a PhD in psychology and I'll be moving to another place after I graduate in a year or so. We hit it off really well, he's the same age I am, he works at the place I used to work at and we have very very similar interests. I love his personality, he's witty and funny. The only thing is... he wants a relationship and I have no idea if i'm ready for that yet. Before we hooked up, he specifically told me that he would be very happy if there could be something more to this, but I told him that there has to be a wall in between us.

I'm just not ready to accommodate my life with another person's, mainly because I actually like hooking up and i'm not out to my family yet. The thing is, what i'm saying... I know is complete and utter bullshit. If I actually wanted this to happen, I would go out of my way to do so... but I'm super conflicted in my feelings right now. One thing is that i'm actually starting to like him and I think it's extremely fun to be around him (even though we just hooked up for one night). I felt really bad when I told him that I don't want a relationship, and so he told me that we shouldn't hook up anymore because he may actually really start liking me. 

So should I try it? I've never actually had a real relationship before, let alone with a guy. I'm not experience and I'm afraid that whatever I do may hurt him and even hurt me. Am I wrong to think that? Should I just try it and see where it goes? Is it worth it, even though I'll be leaving in a year? What's the point of a relationship if we're just going to break up after a while? I don't even know if I actually like him enough to go out with him, mainly because we've only met for one day. How do I know for sure that I actually like him enough? Is it okay to date someone who I don't actually love yet? Or does love come after? I'm sorry guys, my mind is a complete mess right now.

Ever since someone gave me a bacterial STI, I have been very paranoid of hooking up. However, we all get urges. I used to be strictly oral, but not after someone gave me pharyngeal gonorrhea. This person blamed it on me, and blatantly accused me of being a whore when he was the only person I hooked up with after my 18th birthday. And yes, I was tested prior to hooking up with him. It was just two minutes of brief oral sex, and it caused A LOT of anxiety within the past two months. 

I just tested two weeks ago, and the treatment successfully eradicated the bacterial STI. Then, I called in for my results. Negative on all tests. Syphilis, HIV, Gonorrhea, and Chlamydia. The relief only lasted for a couple of days. Now I am diagnosing myself with a rare gonococcal infection called DGI (Disseminated gonococcal infection), in which gonorrhea spreads to your blood and joints. I think the nurse actually tested my blood for the bacterial STI's, but I was too anxious to fully comprehend everything they were saying. 

Fast forward a week later, I chilled with a guy. I was already grounding myself from hooking up. After we talked, I ended up seeing his dick. I just touched it for less than a minute. What happens next? I start worrying about Syphilis (I did not see a chancre). I am even worried about HIV exposure even though I did not come in contact with any fluids. I did NOT even give him a handjob. I asked on the medhelp forums, and both moderators said there was no risk. You're probably wondering why I am not too afraid of HPV and Herpes. Well, I am vaccinated for some strains of HPV. And herpes? 80% of the population already has it. Chances are I do too.

First and foremost, I would like to thank you all for the answers I received. I would like to thanks both the “older” guys for the advice as well as the “young” guys for suggesting to be not too patronizing. Following your advice, I decided to meet him with an open mind about both being more careful and about a relationship. Would say that it was OK, even if drama erupted as someone prophesied.


So, Mike (fictional name) arrived in the early afternoon as planned and I have to say that he was actually cuter IRL than in the pics. And, honestly, he is just a bit overweight like me. I guess that everyone expect him to be some sort of skinny twink. BTW, we ate something I prepared, then started playing. I quite quickly realized that while he is a funny guy and a good BF4 player, he is quite childish. Nothing wrong, but that honestly put dating somewhat out of the picture and reinforced the idea about giving him some advice. Didn't want to be condescending, so dropped some hints while talking about guys, dating, etc... during the breaks between games. I also took some responsibilities for putting him in that situation and I have the impression that he got it. Mike is a kid and behaves like one, but I think he is smart and understand stuff quickly even if not explicitly told.


We played a couple of hours and I thought stuff were going well. Then, a colleague calls me to discuss a problem, so I excuse Mike and go in the living room while he is super busy fighting tanks. I come back around 15-20 mins later and I find him sitting on my bed wearing just his t-shirt. I have to say that I didn't expect that. I considered the possibility he misinterpreted my intentions and I would have had to deal with touchy situations, but that kinda shocked me. I don’t really remember what I said, but I know he started crying and asking if I thought he was too fat and why I told him yesterday I liked his booty.


Honestly, I’m not a person that can handle emotions of others easily, so I don’t know if I did something wrong. I just acted on my (usually poor) instinct. So, I sat next to Mike and hugged him. I told him that he’s very cute and I find him attractive. That he should not be ashamed of his body because every single part is great. That I was sorry for whatever false message I gave last night, but I would be not comfortable with being in a relationship with someone so young (I know, the “it’s not you, it’s me” cliché). That we could be friends or cuddle buddies, but I thought that I wouldn't be able to give him what he deserves.


At this point he had stopped crying, but he was still shaking.  So, I wiped the tears, hugged him tight and kissed him. I pretended to not notice, but he definitely came. Then, we just laid on the bed next to each other, looking silently at the ceiling. Probably everything happened in 10-15 minutes, but it seemed hours for me. I got up and cheerfully asked if he wanted a glass of water and then smash some noobs. Mike finally smiled and said yes. Went to the kitchen to get the water and, when I came back, he was dressed again. We played for another hour, then he left with the agreement that he can always call me.


I really hope I didn't do anything wrong. That was really emotionally intense for me and I greatly underestimated the effects of my behavior. I guess that I learnt something today.

Thanks again for your kind suggestions!

So recently, I feel like I'm getting back into my second semester slump that happened last year. I feel really bothered and annoyed and just kind of feel alone at times. The thing is, I have some great friends who always have my back so I know I'm not alone persay, but I always just feel alone in the relationship department. Obviously I'm not special in that regard, but it's been hitting me extra hard. For context, I've also never been in a real relationship before.

Previously, when I've asked my friends and stuff what to do, they've all told me ""oh you got to work on yourself"". While I definitely agree and think that this is good advice, I feel like I'm pretty happy with the direction that my life is going. I'm doing extremely well in school, I have fantastic chances with applying to medical school next year, I have awesome friends, lots of fulfilling extracurricular activities, I'm in good shape, etc. I really only feel upset with my lack of a love life (or sex life, for that matter), and I feel like it's getting to me worse than usual because of the high amount of stress in my life.

What else can I do? Thanks!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey Bros!&lt;/p&gt;

Tomorrow will be 2 weeks since we have broken up.

Just two days after I wrote that post, he came home very moody and depressed. He didn't want to tell me, but I already knew that the grandpa he was seeing broke it off with him. Probably smelled rebound a mile away. 

We have limited our time together. I was inundated with schoolwork (we are both grad students), so that helped a lot. I've opened up to two very close friends about the details of our break-up, and their perspectives were valuable. I recently regained my libido. I feel more positive about life. Though, there's that heavy feeling in my heart, still. I'm still seeing a counselor.  On the other hand, I noticed that he has been feeling depressed.

This weekend, we have been spending more time together, which hasn't been a problem..  Every once in a while, I will catch him staring at me. I turn to him and say ""what are you looking at?"" He'll sigh and say ""nothing."" Or this morning, I was lying in bed laughing at some silly shit on YouTube or Vine that I was watching on my phone, and in the corner of my eye I saw him peeking from my doorway. I didn't acknowledge him, but this was something we did together on Sunday mornings. 

He also has tried touching me, but I told him not to touch me. I think he is very conflicted (or it could just be my imagination),  but he needs to make a decision and verbalize it to me and stop this wishy-washy business.

I'm fighting the temptation to make a move, especially since he's an introverted Asian. But he needs to make the effort if he wants to work on getting back together.

My whole life I've hated going swimming, taking my shirt off, etc. Lately it's been getting worse. I'm 23 years old and each year I get hairier and hairier. I honest-to-god had a nightmare a while back that I was covered in pelt. So psychologically, this is something that's really bothering me. A lot. And it's having an impact on my life in that I don't want to swim, take my shirt off, or even wear a tank top. Everywhere I go I notice how smooth-skinned everyone else is, especially now that it's hot out. 


How bad is it? My butt looks similar to [this (NSFW)](http://extremehairymen.tumblr.com/post/30598083709/woof), except probably a bit hairier. And within the past year of two I've been getting hair on my back, shoulders, and upper arms. They're basically like back pubes. They're thick, long, wiry, dark and all over the fucking place. I'm too embarrassed to wear a tank top now. I'm also a small guy, 5'6"", 130lbs, so this thick, long body hair looks really out of place on me. 


So, I took matters into my own hands and bought some time with an electrologist. I've gone twice for two hours total. The results were good, until it seemed like hair was growing back from the same pores. Now I'm sitting here thinking about scheduling another appointment with a new provider, but I'm hesitating. It's expensive ($60 for 60 minutes) and I know it's going to take a long time to get the hair I have now removed. Technically, I can afford it. I live at home rent-free and have minimal living expenses. I'm thinking I could afford between 2-4 hours per month. The new provider I spoke to said it could take a couple months to get all my back hair removed. So if I had weekly appointments for the next 6 months it would cost $1,500 for full clearance of my upper arms, shoulders, and back. While I can afford this...it also seems ridiculous to spend so much on hair removal. But it's also something that really bothers me. I'm also worried that even if I get full clearance, new follicles will start growing and that I'm going to be stuck spending a ton of money just to manage my back hair for the rest of my life. But I suppose that's better than doing nothing and ending up covered in pelt by the time I'm 30. 


I also don't know how to square my desire for hair removal with my belief in body positivity. I honestly am not grossed out by other guys' body hair. I'm really body positive in the sense that I don't have any judgement for overweight guys, hairy guys, whatever. Yet I can't really apply this to myself. It's easy to be accepting of others differences, but it feels uncomfortable when you're the one that's different. And I know that there's a lot of guys that are into body hair, think it's erotic, but...I don't know. I guess I'd prefer to be conventionally attractive. I suppose I'm also afraid of being silently judged or getting looks in public. Which is dumb, I know. Why should it matter to me what others think? Yet I can't help feeling really self-conscious about this issue. Part of me wants to get this body hair removed, but another part of my wants to say ""fuck society's standards, I'm not changing anything."" I'd feel more confident it I saw other hairy guys running shirtless, swimming, whatever, but I don't. I suppose every other hairy guy is feeling the same way and covering it up.

And I know that there&amp;#39;s a lot of guys that are into body hair, think it&amp;#39;s erotic, but...I don&amp;#39;t know. I guess I&amp;#39;d prefer to be conventionally attractive. I suppose I&amp;#39;m also afraid of being silently judged or getting looks in public. Which is dumb, I know. Why should it matter to me what others think? Yet I can&amp;#39;t help feeling really self-conscious about this issue. Part of me wants to get this body hair removed, but another part of my wants to say &amp;quot;fuck society&amp;#39;s standards, I&amp;#39;m not changing anything.&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;d feel more confident it I saw other hairy guys running shirtless, swimming, whatever, but I don&amp;#39;t. I suppose every other hairy guy is feeling the same way and covering it up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has anyone on here gotten electrolysis? Did you think it was worth the cost? Has anyone on here purposely chosen not to get hair removal?&lt;/p&gt;

So Ive always been a hugely sexual guy (started at a very young age, and had many partners, was even a rentboy for a while), but back in 2013, I started dating this guy who had almost no sex drive whatsoever (We had sex twice in a year and a half of dating, neither time to completion), but I loved him (gak) and resigned myself to less sex, until we tried having an open relationship. 

After we broke up, I didnt even go into my usual SlutMode right away, maybe a little dabbling here and there, but overall I noticed less desire to whore around. I chalked it up to maturity or whatever. Fast forward to now, and even after moving to SoCal, the promised land of hot boys (and girls, BiBro representing!), I find that I am almost completely uninterested in sex whatsoever. I have this fuck buddy out here (who even does porn for crissakes'!) and we haven't had sex in months. 

So my question is- Did any of you have this issue as well? What did you do about it? Am I fucked for life, doomed to live as a celibate curmudgeon at the ripe old age of 22? Where do I get my cat lady ""Given up on a sex life"" starter kit?

Any advice on this would be greatly appreciated. Being sexually active is kind of a huge part of my identity (not to mention a main source of cardio!) and without it im kind of having an identity crisis, which is carrying over to other factors in my life.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys.

He knows I'm into bears and although he's a good mate and we're close, he doesn't do it for me. And I also try to avoid getting feelings for unavailable guys - he's married as well as straight so double unavailable.

Last week I was round at his watching Game of Thrones.  His wife was out of town and we were having a few beers.  There was a gay sex scene and he started going on about how he couldn't understand why anyone would be into that, which was kinda out of character because he's usually very supportive.  Then a few beers later we're playing computer games which turns into play wrestling.  My recollection is that he instigated it, but he's since claimed it was me.

So he trys to give me a wedgie and ends up ripping my boxer shorts.  We're then rolling on the ground and trying to get each other to submit.  He brings up a safeword to shout when either of us has had enough.  Then he grabs my balls and threatens to squeeze but I shove him off.  Then he grabs my right nipple, hard, and starts twisting it, hard enough that my chest is bruised days later. Again I fight him off and put him in a chokehold. He then starts to bite me to get out of it, I can't remember the exact sequence but in the morning I have two bitemarks on my torso and two on my thighs, and heavy bruising.  I end up submitting because he's actually hurting me now and I had no intention of hurting him.  After that we call it a night, shake hands, and i stagger drunkenly home.

Next day he texts me all apologetic and I tell him jokingly he's got supressed sexual tension.  He denys it but asks me not to tell anyone what happened. Again I make a joke out of it, telling him that's what abusers tell their victims.  But I am a bit pissed off with him.  He's been one of my closest friends for years and now I'm just confused as to what he was thinking.

I have been with my partner for 2 years. We have had normal ups and downs, and we are both generally happy with the relationship.

We have discussed the future and we are both on the fence about what we want: to fight through a long distance relationship and have the possibility of it completely not working and being unhappy, or ending it now and saving the possible pain.

Here is where it gets gray: I downloaded the app Tandem, to talk with people from other countries to help me exercise my Spanish. I started talking to a guy from Chile with no romantic intentions at all, and now we text and talk on the regular, since about a week ago. 

I feel that it is only right for me to end my relationship, to be respectful of my partners emotions. I will most likely not mention the new guy.
