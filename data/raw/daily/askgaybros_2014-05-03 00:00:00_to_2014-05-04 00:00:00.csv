So I'm a junior in college. I have great friends (some of whom I'm out to). I'm very introverted and discreet. I suppress a lot of my emotions and my sexuality. I just recently started opening up about it. I've always been a good guy and good student. I do everything I'm supposed to do, I don't argue with people, I get good grades, I help people, etc. This is why this sudden desire is weird for me. 

I used to be satisfied just with self-pleasure, but that isn't enough for me anymore. For the past month or so, all I have wanted to do is be intimate with a guy, even if that doesn't mean penetrative sex, just being close to another man is enough. I have had a couple experiences like this in the past that I weren't supposed to happen (I didn't go to them with the intention of having any sexual contact. One time I was coerced; the other time, it just kinda happened). But those were a couple years ago and until now, I had never had this desire to be intimate. It's just really against what I usually do and I'm not used to not being ""good"". Am I being stupid for following my desires to hook up? I'm probably going to regret it. I just feel bad for not having the ""good kid"" mentality of waiting until a relationship/marriage and having sex with someone you trust/love. I keep trying to fight this feeling, but it won't go away. I hate feeling like the typical stupid college kid who wants to have sex.

We both have extremely busy schedules so it was hard to find time when we were both free.  After a couple weeks he started getting weird and started to ignore me.

These past six months I thought I wanted nothing more than to see him but when I finally did, I remembered how much he hurt me and I just got angry.

I met this guy on Growlr about a month ago. I'm 19 and he's 20. We chatted for a week then exchanged numbers and Facebook info. We agreed to hang out one day. We ate dinner and then walked and talked for a few hours. This wasn't a date, though, even though I really wished it was; it was just two friends hanging out. We continue to talk daily for hours over Facebook messaging and texts. If I didn't initiate it, he would. We talk about everything from school to sexual fantasies. We're both totally comfortable around each other. I started developing a crush on him. He only sees me as a friend still, I think. In our conversations, he would sometimes get a little flirty, so I try to be flirty back but he would just send me back a thumbs up emoji. He meets a lot of guys in the area from Growlr. Some for hookups and some just to hangout. Today, we hangout again. I don't have a car and he does, so he drives 30 mins to see me both times. This time, we chill in my room for a bit just talking. We go out to eat and come back and he suggests we watch a movie on my laptop. I get really excited because from all the stories I read on this subreddit, watching a movie together is always how intimate moments happen. For the first half of the movie, I'm sitting in the chair and he's on my bed. I finally find the courage to get up and lay on the bed to watch the movie. However, for the rest of the movie, nothing happens between us besides talking about the movie. I didn't want to make a move for fear that he wouldn't reciprocate. After the movie ends, he has to leave so I walk him out to his car. We hug and say our goodbyes. He says ""Thanks, for hanging out with me today,"" which is what he said the last time we met. Obviously, this is a sign he just sees me as a friend and nothing more. Should I tell him that I like him and want to be more than friends, or would that ruin everything we have right now? I've never been in a relationship before and this guy just feels right. Should I just take it slow and see how this friendship develops? I should mention that I fit the picture of his ideal guy to the T, so I'm confused why he hasn't shown more of an interest in me.

Then, we talked about AIDS and how I needed to be careful,she doesn't want me to fuck around, she wants to meet my future BF. Also she asked me if I've had any relationship.

Brother(twin) story

I went into his room and said "" Bro I'm gay"" I felt weird but whatever. He said ""Really...ok""

He didn't believe me so I had to get mom and now their talking about it. But he did say he loves me and he doesn't care. Just need time to digest the information. I'm fine with that. 

Also my mom really want me to get OUT THERE, I was like ""mom I'm not getting a rainbow flag and dancing in the street"" lol. I asked her if she mind if I brought my future bf to thanksgiving and Christmas and she said as long as she meets him first lol. Also she and my grandma had already had this conversation and she said my grandma supports me no matter what. And that my family ""has known, they've seem me grow up"" and they will accept me no matter what. :):):)

She said &amp;quot;I need you to be you, be who you are&amp;quot;. I laughed a bit because I knew where she was going with that. &lt;/p&gt;

So i am a bisexual guy who hasn't really come out to anyone, except for some of my close friends, and a few other people that (unfortunately) found out. I'm a teenager, so naturally, with hormones raging, I am a bit of a ""horn-dawg"" as some people might call it. I really want to be in a relationship, but that seems impossible for me. I mean, I can get with girls, but I never want to take it to the relationship level because I am not ever strongly attracted to them. I really only get with girls to fulfill the sexual desire that is bubbling inside of me all of the time that needs to be externalized. The thing is, I only get with people for the sake of getting with them. I haven't gotten with anyone that I had a serious crush on in like 5 years (she was a girl). Its so much better being with your crush, but that is impossible, because I don't even have real crushes anymore. I mean I do, but I feel the strongest feelings towards other guys, and I know that they are straight, so I have to destroy my feelings. When I meet a gay guy, sometimes I force myself to develop a love for him so that it can be feasible for me to be with him, but the feelings are artificial and they never last. I realize that I may be setting the bar too high, or being to vain, but I fall in love with someone or I don't. and not everyone who I crush on looks like they should be in movies, either. A lot of the time I like guys who would be considered average looking to others, but to me they are all that I see.

I don't necessarily want to be gay, or straight, or bi. I don't want to label myself. I just want to be with the person that I develop love for. I can't choose who that is, but since these days I only fall in love with guys, and all of them are straight, I feel like I'm suppressed. I now know where the word ""crush"" comes from.

None of my close friends do this, but I have a lot of straight male acquaintances/buddies who say ""that's so gay"" and it's infuriating to me.

As I&amp;#39;ve moved further and further along in my coming out process, I&amp;#39;ve been feeling myself become more offended when I hear &amp;quot;that&amp;#39;s so gay&amp;quot; being tossed around casually as a way of saying &amp;quot;that&amp;#39;s so dumb&amp;quot; and the like. I usually (respectfully) call people out on it, but a lot of times they become defensive and say something along the lines of &amp;quot;hurr durr I didn&amp;#39;t mean it that way, I have no problem with gay people/&amp;quot;gay&amp;quot; has two meanings/implied intent is important/you&amp;#39;re being too sensitive.&amp;quot; None of my close friends do this, but I have a lot of straight male acquaintances/buddies who say &amp;quot;that&amp;#39;s so gay&amp;quot; and it&amp;#39;s infuriating to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can I articulate (in a way that straight people will understand) that they are perpetuating a culture in which a word that describes me (gay) is associated with something negative? Or am I being too sensitive? Any advice/experience is welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

He is also bisexual with a ton of more experience even mentioning that he fucked guys older than 40. I really wanted my first gay experience to be with him since he is a friend I could trust and meeting up with strangers off an app felt odd. 


So here we are in my room watching some gay porn when we start feeling up on each other. His body felt nice, 6 pack, nice butt, and over 7 inch dick. But I didn't really enjoy it. We did some kissing and exchanged hand jobs since I mentioned to him before that I'm not ready for anal sex. Although I notice when I stopped questioning myself in my mind if what I'm doing is fine, I enjoyed it more and was able to cum.


Am I attracted to guys? It felt like he was enjoying it a lot more and I barely moaned compared to him. But I got a boner right away when I saw him thinking about what is about to come. I just thought it would feel better and I would cum quicker. Like I said though once I disconnected from the world and focus on him, I was able enjoy it more.


The good and the bad of my first gay experience. Bad: cum all over my sheets and pillow, felt weird at first, his dick felt weird since it was a different shape, kissing was bad since there was a lot saliva and teeth, my penis foreskin started to hurt when we dry hump up and down, and I called him some other guy name that he knows I find attractive. 


Good: He enjoyed it, I enjoyed it when I force myself, I liked feeling his abs and body, made me feel more confident about my body, understood my sexuality more, and I wanted to cuddle more. 


So my questions are, will it get better and if so how? Am I attracted to guys or bisexual if I need to force my mind to enjoy it? If his penis was on my ass but there was no penetration, can I catch HIV/STDs? How do I eliminate the pain of my foreskin when humping?  Does anal sex feel good?
