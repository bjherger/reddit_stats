Now the time isn't so much a problem getting to and from his place, it's actually the frequency.  At the moment he lives with his parents, doesn't have his driving license, isn't out to his parents, still finishing school and his parents rarely go away for weekends.  Which leaves us with very scarce opportunities to see each other.  The last time I actually got to kiss him was about 6 weeks ago, and the time before that was probably closer to 10.  So we try to make up for it using skype and texting and facebook, however we both find these mediums to be lacking in intimacy.  There's only so much texting you can do or camming before it's just.....  We both want contact to touch to feel to kiss to taste, but that's not going to happen again for several more weeks.  We are both dying to see each other, but there's times where I start getting antsy and a bit angry because I want to be with him and sometimes argue - well I wouldn't call it arguing as such because it's one sided because he knows and is feeling the same way just doesn't really vocalise it.  

So what I'm asking gaybros is how do you guys deal with it and how do you stop yourself from getting angry?  I know the anger is somewhat rational, but I still feel fucking terrible when I do get angry.   What would be some ways for us or for me to show him I care massively for him when I get to see him next?  I wanted to get him something to wear or hold when I'm not there.  Any suggestions that aren't super girly?  I was thinking jewellery but I don't know if that's really appropriate or not.  I know he likes leather and is a pup so maybe something made from leather like a cuff or something.  Any suggestions from other gaybros would be awesome.  

I also would like to preempt any discussion regarding age difference - it is legal here in Queensland, Australia.  I don't believe age is an indication of maturity either.  We have chemistry, similar levels of maturity, and he is much wiser than his age would otherwise indicate (quite the little intellectual).  So please refrain from such discussions and debates on this.  Thanks.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So me (23) and my boyfriend (17) currently live about 2 hours apart.

I handled it fairly well (politely joked back and walked somewhere else with my friend), but everything made the night way less fun than it could have been. I understand being a young guy at a bar full of people into guys comes with some risk of meeting creepers, but it seemed like I constantly was having to deal with people.

Is this normal? Like I said, I've never been to a gay bar before, so maybe the four or five I went to were extra creepy. If so, are there any places you'd recommend instead? I'm fine with dancing/whatever, but I'd just like fun people to be there who won't make me uncomfortable.

&lt;p&gt;I handled it fairly well (politely joked back and walked somewhere else with my friend), but everything made the night way less fun than it could have been. I understand being a young guy at a bar full of people into guys comes with some risk of meeting creepers, but it seemed like I constantly was having to deal with people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this normal? Like I said, I&amp;#39;ve never been to a gay bar before, so maybe the four or five I went to were extra creepy. If so, are there any places you&amp;#39;d recommend instead? I&amp;#39;m fine with dancing/whatever, but I&amp;#39;d just like fun people to be there who won&amp;#39;t make me uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Fixed a word&lt;/p&gt;

Personally, as a gay guy with a foot fetish, I love it! So far I've only met another guy with this same fetish and it was great. There are some guys with really nasty feet, sure, but I can't resist cute guys' feet. It is also boosted when they wear the right shoes and socks.

As a heads up, I apologize for the wall.

I've been talking to this guy(21) for the past maybe week or so, and during that time, I've been going a bit crazy with over-analyzing and thinking the situation I'm in. 

As a bit of a back story, I'm 19 from a not so small town in the south (Louisiana). I've only really been in one relationship (which ended in April), and I feel like poor experiences in that situation have been seeping, and sometimes flooding, into my current could-be-relationship. The reason that the previous relationship ended was because he was cheating on me throughout the length of it, and with me knowing and trying to work it out with him for while. However, the thing that made me feel the worst about it was that I felt that we was using me for sex, like I was just a body to get off and cuddle with with no value for me as a person. That's the feeling that I've been getting from this new guy.

During the times that New Guy and I have been hanging out, we usually will watch a movie, cuddle, make out, and talk. We've been saying to each other to ignore what's going on ""down there"", as I've expressed my anxiety about being used from my past and I (we?) don't want it to go there just yet. Am I wrong to think that withholding sex from a relationship would make the relationship more meaningful?

Last night, while New Guy and I were cuddling and making out, I asked him what kind of mindset I should be going into this with. Neither of us really had an answer, as he's never been in a relationship before and, I didn't want to suade his thoughts in one way or another. However, at the end of the night, we came to the conclusion that: 1) We feel like we could have a possible emotional connection, and 2) Neither of us are looking for anything else.

Its just that I'm hesitant to believe him 100%. We met through Grindr, and I uninstalled it shortly after getting his number. I know that last night he still had it installed, but I don't really have any reason to not believe him. I just can't help but have the feeling that shit's just going to turn out bad, you know? So I've got to thinking that all the problems I feel like I'm having are just problems that I've thought into existence and aren't really there. Which isn't exactly comforting, either.

I always feel uncomfortable when speaking with new people, do I look them in the eyes all the time and is it wierd if I just look a bit in their eyes and then a bit arround (yeah I know how silly this question sunds, but I&amp;#39;m thinking about WTF I&amp;#39;m doing all the time)? Is it weird if I ask for their facebook first day in class and how do I ask them?
What do I do if people are grouped (I don&amp;#39;t know anyone in my classes)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanj you for your answers guys!&lt;/p&gt;

I spent nearly three years in one in rural KS. My bf spent about 6 months in another one in KS before running away. Mine was total isolation, a lot of hard labor and ""discipline"" by staff. I lived in a house with between 8-13 other guys. Sounds fun, but the amount of guilt the staff could put on the guys was insane, they usually confessed quickly if anything happened.

Mine was the usual Christian approach, lots of laying of hands and demanding demons leave. Miniature exorcisms, that type of thing. Staff was very aggressive about no masturbation, no movies over PG-13, no computers, no phone, all mail and packages opened. No contact with family unless a staff member was also on the call.  Cold showers with time limits and surprise inspections of course. Lots of fear tactics, violence at times. Guys would disappear without warning, and no one would tell us where they went. Home, I assume, or ran away. 

I made it three years with no intention of changing. Every other guy claimed to be straight to be released, and was set up with a potential wife on leaving, with required weekly meetings together and separately between staff and them. I was able to get online and  combat much of their claims as an anonymous source, and broke into offices at night to find potential ""students"" info and contact them and their families. In my last year only two guys came, they left within two weeks. Staff was cut to two families, and funding began falling. When I left I actively and openly refuted their claims online and received several threats, but the camp was shut-down within a year due to lack of interest and funding. The one my bf was at is still open and active, claiming to also serve as a rehab and ""troubled youth"" program, though they have no detox or rehab services and don't provide promises like GED etc.

Anyone else been through this? A person collects a lot of stories in these places, I hope you're willing to share if so. No names of camps if you aren't comfortable, I know I signed a books worth of legal documents, so protect yourself in discussion as always!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I thought this was pretty uncommon but I&amp;#39;ve ran across several guys recently who&amp;#39;ve been through this one way or another and am curious to see if there&amp;#39;s many of us here. &lt;/p&gt;

I have had a sore throat for a couple of days now after giving head to some random guy at a party I went to (stupid I know). It's only gotten worse and I now have a few white sores at the back of my throat. I'm almost positive it's an STD now. I haven't got the slightest clue who this guy is, but I'm pretty sure I might of contracted something from him. 

I'm thinking of approaching my mom who is extremely supportive of me and is also a nursing professor, but I'm scared shitless. She knows I'm gay, but I've been lying to her about being sexually active for a while now. She's always pounded safe sex into my head, and I always use a condom when it comes to anal, but I was naive and figured oral sex was ""safer"". 

I just don't know how to approach her. I was thinking about lying and telling her that I think I have strep throat or something, but whats the point? The doctor would just end up diagnosing me with an STD anyways.
