So to get it out of the way, I don't have any sexual experience to speak of, let alone any in this particular area, so be mindful of everything that comes with that. I don't know a whole heap about how Dom/Sub relationships function, so I'll be happy if people are able to clear up some misconceptions I might have.

So my main line of questioning really revolves around how you _feel_, and how everything works, in a D/S relationship. The idea of being a sub is really exciting for me, but in normal, everyday life I have some pretty strong views and I can be exceptionally stubborn and proud. So my first question is: how do you reconcile these two contrasting personality traits? I've heard people talk about 'subspace' (I was reading the Noodles and Beef blog on that was posted on /r/gaybros earlier), but I just can't see how it would work. Not to mention, the guy on the blog talked about his subs crying every time they enter into such a state, which didn't really strike me as healthy.

Secondly, I'm a really shy and reserved person and I don't feel like I'd be inclined towards any PDA's or anything (I don't feel comfortable with them on anyone, hetero or homo, and I dislike this aspect of Pride parades as well)... but it seems other D/S couples don't have a care in the world about displaying the dynamic. I can't really think of anything that would be more embarrassing for me, personally. And, as the sub, it wouldn't really be my decision to make, would it? So second question: can you leave all the D/S stuff in the bedroom like you would plain vanilla sex, or is it customary to just let it all out? I ask this mainly because people in general _very much_ think less of submissive guys as a rule - let alone blatantly devoted submissiveness on this level. I don't know what I expected of even /r/gaybros, but most people don't seem open-minded at all in this regard at all. A lot of them seem more than willing to stereotype and dismiss like the rest of the world (if bottom-shaming exists, then I can only imagine what people think of subs). There's also the stereotypical links to effeminacy and weakness, which I'm already trying to distance myself from.

Thirdly, I have a really hard time trusting anyone. Take that as a symptom of my lack of world experience if you want, but I just can't imagine _completely_ putting yourself in someone else's hands like that. I imagine it's not easy for people who have a normal level of trust in others, let alone people who are more reserved. So how do you manage it?

Fourth and finally, the topic of self-esteem. Side-note: I'm aware I'm basically a walking stereotype of the shy, withdrawn, naive gay kid with social anxiety, but I'm trying to overcome all that. I've always had trouble with self-esteem, and now even more so that my gym-going isn't yielding great results. I have a pretty slim frame overall (mostly twink, as others would call it) that I'm trying to change, and I'm fairly neutral in terms of masculinity / effeminacy. So as someone who struggles with their image and their sense of worth as it is, I can't imagine coping with having my entire self-worth based on another person. I mean, as a sub you're basically viewed as more of a possession than a partner, right? 

So I'm guessing the answers to all of this will revolve around 'you'll be fine when you grow up and get some experience', but... I don't know. I guess I'm curious more than anything and am having a hard time picturing vanilla old me in such an extreme relationship.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**TL;DR:**
As the sub in a D/S relationship...

... how do you cope with completely and automatically beholden/submissive to your Dom if you're stubborn and proud in other areas? Does this dynamic bleed into other areas of your life?

... how do you deal with the negative connotations that are attached to you as the sub, even in the gay community?

... is it the norm for the Dom/Sub dynamic to be public information, and expressed in public? And if so, how would you deal with that as a private kind of guy?

... how hard is it to have complete trust and faith in your Dom, and how big is the initial leap into the relationship?

... how do you maintain your self-esteem when you as a human being are dependent on your Dom?

If I offended anyone with my lack of insight, it obviously wasn't intended and I apologise in advance. And if it needed clarifying, I was talking about a monogamous relationship involving a single Dom and his Sub... I feel like anything more complex would be completely overwhelming at this point.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apologies in advance for the wall of text.

1) Coming out to roommates:

I'm not formally out to them, and my sexuality's always (unintentionally) been a sort of ""don't ask, don't tell"" sort of thing. They're both straight, and last year, I told one I was bi, and a gay coworker of the other outed me to him. To the roommate I was outed to, part of the issue is the fact that he doesn't believe in bisexuality, and sees things as either gay or straight. 

While I realize I'm gay, now, I also realize that he's wrong about bisexuals. How do I approach this? And, in another note, I still feel a degree of shame when I hookup in my own room (ridiculous, I know), and they find out about it. What should I do about this?

2) Coming out to my mother:

My mother, while she claims she's my biggest supporter, panics easily. As in, she's the type who's medicated for her anxiety. To add, whenever she's with me,  she'll often ask if I found a girlfriend yet. I keep trying to misdirect her by saying I'm focusing on whatever ""crisis"" is at hand (school, job searching, no money, etc.).

 To complicate things, she's very religious; increasingly so. And, she always asks me to go to church. And, while I want her to be happy, I refuse to go to that church because they're vehemently anti-gay (part of why I was uncomfortable enough to leave it, back when I lived with her; a fact I told her, myself). 

How can I approach her on this? And, how do I tell her that I'm just not all that religious? I know it'd break her heart. And, to add, I know she wants kids. While I can still have them as a gay man, how I best approach this?

3) Coming out to my father:

Y'all knew it was coming.

This is the one I'm always on about, and one whose reaction I fear the most.

Out of everyone in my immediate family, my father's the only one I can, without a doubt, confirm his homophobia. Whenever I was younger, he prevented me from acting or walking certain ways because, in his words, ""only faggots do that, and you're not a faggot"".

It makes me sad to hear my father say he's proud of me, because he'd, likely, be the worst to take having a gay son. He's noticed that I've been distant, lately, and I can't tell him why (I'm gay), because I don't know what would happen.

Now, my father's a non-practicing Christian, but he is VERY stubborn, and has a very short temper with people he disagrees with.

What's worse is that he is largely the one who takes care of me, monetarily. And, I worry that if he knew I was gay, he'd have no reason to keep taking care of me, and he'd probably cut off me and my mother (they're divorced).

Not too long ago, while dropping me off at my hotel for a convention, he noticed a guy in a wig, and complained to me about it. I didn't say a thing, but I want to give you an idea of his character.

4) My older brother and sister

Virtually non-issues, since I'm hardly in contact with them, but they're bound to find out eventually. How do I approach them?

My bro's smart, but he's also sort of the hoodrat type; thuggish and hypermasculine. He's, honestly, got to be the straightest guy I know, and he ALWAYS asks me about ""the girls in my life"" when he sees me. Politically, my brother is very similar to my father, and his views of gays fall along similar lines.

Now, my sister is a very intelligent lady, but VERY much the type to keep to herself. Politically, I don't know where she stands, but I do know she's a Christian (attends church whenever possible), and very strict with her kids, likely the result of being a police officer. I talk to her even less than my brother.

5) Facebook: 

Complicated issue here. 

I've got lots of gay friends (who are aware of my sexuality) who will support me, just like I have lots of homophobic friends I've known for years who won't.

To add, I've got several friends who (and I hate to admit this) I either bullied for being gay when I was younger, or even called me out for bullying gay guys when I was young. What of them?

But, here's why this is such a big issue:

Three of my cousins (all brothers) on Facebook are DEVOUTLY religious, and are members of the same church as my mother. My aunt was practically a mother growing up, and she also lets me know how proud she is of me when she gets the chance. That said, she is, most likely, the LEAST tolerant person I've ever met (arguably on Westboro Baptist Church levels) when it comes not only to gays, but non-Christians. My cousins, while similar, aren't nearly as bad, but I know it's close. It's bad, because they're all like brothers to me. We practically grew up together. What of them? I know they're bound to say something, and my aunt and mother are VERY close. 

6) My extended family:

I don't know much about their personal lives, but I know I'll have to confront them eventually.

*I'm jealous of the people who are out.* 

That, and being closeted has begun to take its toll on my mental health and personal well-being. I feel that living life like this any longer won't end well for me.

That, and I know that coming out will dramatically increase my confidence because I won't have to hide anymore. But, I need to figure out how to come out to them all, first. How do I approach this?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve got a lot going on here, so bear with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Coming out to roommates:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not formally out to them, and my sexuality&amp;#39;s always (unintentionally) been a sort of &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t ask, don&amp;#39;t tell&amp;quot; sort of thing.

To the roommate I was outed to, part of the issue is the fact that he doesn&amp;#39;t believe in bisexuality, and sees things as either gay or straight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I realize I&amp;#39;m gay, now, I also realize that he&amp;#39;s wrong about bisexuals. How do I approach this? And, in another note, I still feel a degree of shame when I hookup in my own room (ridiculous, I know), and they find out about it. What should I do about this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Coming out to my mother:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mother, while she claims she&amp;#39;s my biggest supporter, panics easily. As in, she&amp;#39;s the type who&amp;#39;s medicated for her anxiety. To add, whenever she&amp;#39;s with me,  she&amp;#39;ll often ask if I found a girlfriend yet. I keep trying to misdirect her by saying I&amp;#39;m focusing on whatever &amp;quot;crisis&amp;quot; is at hand (school, job searching, no money, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To complicate things, she&amp;#39;s very religious; increasingly so. And, she always asks me to go to church. And, while I want her to be happy, I refuse to go to that church because they&amp;#39;re vehemently anti-gay (part of why I was uncomfortable enough to leave it, back when I lived with her; a fact I told her, myself). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can I approach her on this? And, how do I tell her that I&amp;#39;m just not all that religious? I know it&amp;#39;d break her heart. And, to add, I know she wants kids. While I can still have them as a gay man, how I best approach this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Coming out to my father:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Y&amp;#39;all knew it was coming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the one I&amp;#39;m always on about, and one whose reaction I fear the most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of everyone in my immediate family, my father&amp;#39;s the only one I can, without a doubt, confirm his homophobia. Whenever I was younger, he prevented me from acting or walking certain ways because, in his words, &amp;quot;only faggots do that, and you&amp;#39;re not a faggot&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It makes me sad to hear my father say he&amp;#39;s proud of me, because he&amp;#39;d, likely, be the worst to take having a gay son. He&amp;#39;s noticed that I&amp;#39;ve been distant, lately, and I can&amp;#39;t tell him why (I&amp;#39;m gay), because I don&amp;#39;t know what would happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, my father&amp;#39;s a non-practicing Christian, but he is VERY stubborn, and has a very short temper with people he disagrees with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s worse is that he is largely the one who takes care of me, monetarily. And, I worry that if he knew I was gay, he&amp;#39;d have no reason to keep taking care of me, and he&amp;#39;d probably cut off me and my mother (they&amp;#39;re divorced).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not too long ago, while dropping me off at my hotel for a convention, he noticed a guy in a wig, and complained to me about it. I didn&amp;#39;t say a thing, but I want to give you an idea of his character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) My older brother and sister&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Virtually non-issues, since I&amp;#39;m hardly in contact with them, but they&amp;#39;re bound to find out eventually. How do I approach them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My bro&amp;#39;s smart, but he&amp;#39;s also sort of the hoodrat type; thuggish and hypermasculine. He&amp;#39;s, honestly, got to be the straightest guy I know, and he ALWAYS asks me about &amp;quot;the girls in my life&amp;quot; when he sees me. Politically, my brother is very similar to my father, and his views of gays fall along similar lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, my sister is a very intelligent lady, but VERY much the type to keep to herself. Politically, I don&amp;#39;t know where she stands, but I do know she&amp;#39;s a Christian (attends church whenever possible), and very strict with her kids, likely the result of being a police officer. I talk to her even less than my brother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) Facebook: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Complicated issue here. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve got lots of gay friends (who are aware of my sexuality) who will support me, just like I have lots of homophobic friends I&amp;#39;ve known for years who won&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add, I&amp;#39;ve got several friends who (and I hate to admit this) I either bullied for being gay when I was younger, or even called me out for bullying gay guys when I was young. What of them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, here&amp;#39;s why this is such a big issue:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three of my cousins (all brothers) on Facebook are DEVOUTLY religious, and are members of the same church as my mother. My aunt was practically a mother growing up, and she also lets me know how proud she is of me when she gets the chance. That said, she is, most likely, the LEAST tolerant person I&amp;#39;ve ever met (arguably on Westboro Baptist Church levels) when it comes not only to gays, but non-Christians. My cousins, while similar, aren&amp;#39;t nearly as bad, but I know it&amp;#39;s close. It&amp;#39;s bad, because they&amp;#39;re all like brothers to me. We practically grew up together. What of them? I know they&amp;#39;re bound to say something, and my aunt and mother are VERY close. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6) My extended family:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know much about their personal lives, but I know I&amp;#39;ll have to confront them eventually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&amp;#39;m jealous of the people who are out.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That, and being closeted has begun to take its toll on my mental health and personal well-being. I feel that living life like this any longer won&amp;#39;t end well for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That, and I know that coming out will dramatically increase my confidence because I won&amp;#39;t have to hide anymore. But, I need to figure out how to come out to them all, first. How do I approach this?&lt;/p&gt;

Anyway, so I recently graduated from college (about year now), 22 yrs old and landed an OK paying full-time, 9-5 job. It’s boring as hell and I’ve been applying to other places wih no luck, and  I’ve grown really dismissive about reality to the point that I get into depressive/immobile states.  My loneliness definitely stems, in part, from the fact that I’m no longer in college with a group of friends and/or have the ability to seek out that thrill of meeting a new guy in class that I could maybe have a relationship with (wishful thinking) . But also, my loneliness comes from the fact that I know I’m gay, maybe I’ll hook up with girls when I’m drunk but to be frank, my dick gets hard for guys and it has since puberty so I know what I am and I know that deepening but strangely envious feeling for a guy you get when you have a crush.

Anway, over this past year of living on my own like a grown-ass adult, my sense of loneliness has sunk in more, but I have been able to overcome it by working out, reading and hanging out with some friends and family.  I was doing well distracting myself as best I could, but then, an intern started working in my department, who’s going to be a senior in college. I’ve engegaged him but I know it’s all illusions of grandeur and I can’t really befriend him like I could do with a guy in college. I feel a closeness with him but I don’t trust my instincts because I know I’m probably making overexcited connections like oh he leaned over me on my desk, he patted me on the back that’s physical contact so he must like me…chances are (the office rumor is) he blazes before work (objectively thinking about his behavior leads me to the same conclusion) He’s a fratbrah, with all his boys in other departments interning and they all go out to lunch together,. So it can’t be guinie affection., right? He’s probably as straight  as a laser pointer (best simile I could think of atm). He laughs at things I say but I don’t know if he’s just being polite since he’s the intern. Also, I’ve opened up to him to see if he’d do the same. I didn’t divulge everything about my life but enough to get him to say more. So I felt comfortable enough to give him my number to hang out any time in my town since my town got some bars and shit to do, we both like the same music, do the same drugs (MDMA, acid, weed—though I seldom do it now out of college, if at all) and he’s basically the same age as me. After giving him my number, he never texted me to say like hey here’s mine, probably lost the note or threw it out and thought like wtf  or maybe he thought it was inappropriate for him to contact me? In my approach so far, I feel like I’m being obsessive, but no one in department is my age, everyone is 27 years old plus and all married, or engaged and I’m beginning to realize that any opportunity to actually hang out with this guy is closing out. Part of me just wants a friend my age that I can do shit with but also a friend that could maybe, just maybe be a little bit more or experiement with……God, I hate this….

I had my most recent breakdown when I got home from work today—couldn’t move, just sat there and just started crying uncontrollably. I hate this empty, cold and lost feeling. I want to feel at “home,” I want to be with someone and feel comfortable, at last. Not just rotting away in a cubicle, waiting for the light to finally shine through the shadow. Again some of my issue is that my job is miserable and I have a lot career anxiety, but also this unattainable love and sense of being trapped in lonileness scares me. Once summer is over, I’ll never see this intern again, and……fuck, idk what to do. Should I friend him on social media? I’m also not “out” but as an introverted/laid back (or so I appear to be) guy, the whole coming out and look at me thing, is not for me, no offense. Anyway, I appreciate the feedback, hopefully this makes sense, but just writing this helped…..

This might be the most awkward thread I've made in my entire life, but luckily this is a throwaway account with an awful name and it won't matter. :)

Question 1: A month ago, I fingered myself (Is that the correct term?) in the arse and it .. went well. I managed to get an entire finger in there, and I was quite happy. Although, I didn't have any lube (Still don't) so I had to use water but it worked. The whole experience was fine. I couldn't find my prostate, and inside my arse was a big, scary and kind of soft place and it felt really odd when I fingered myself. What's it supposed to feel like? It wasn't the greatest thing I've ever felt in my life, and I sometimes felt my dick get harder when I fingered a certain place in my arse, and it helped make my orgasms a little bit stronger but it wasn't the best thing in the entire world so I'm 100 % sure I did something wrong. My question is: What did I do wrong? What's it all supposed to feel like?


Question 2: I've watched a documentary a week ago about a man with a small penis, and I was just wondering what people think of my size. My penis is 5.7 inches according to Google. 


Question 3: Time for an incredibly weird one. I still can't believe I did this. Alright, the thing I'm going to explain right now happened earlier today. I was very horny, and I felt like fingering myself (I'm a virgin) but I didn't have any toys so I grabbed a dry pickle (It was hard, dry and about 4 inches long, and 2.5 inches wide so it was an alright size.) from my fridge and I went to the bathroom. I washed the pickle with water, and I inserted it into my arse. I know. Using a pickle as a toy is WEIRD. Anyway, it hurt, but not as much as I thought it would (At first!) but it didn't feel amazing like I thought it would, Once again, I felt disappointed. Also, that whole experience scared me. I have a few questions. Firstly, is it dangerous to use a dry pickle as a sex toy? Secondly, if inserting a pickle inside my arse hurt THAT much, how on earth am I going to have sex? And the whole experience wasn't very enjoyable, which is why I'm disappointed. Does sex REALLY feel like that? 

I'll end this by saying that I'm only 16, and very inexperienced.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heeello! This might be the most awkward thread I&amp;#39;ve made in my entire life, but luckily this is a throwaway account with an awful name and it won&amp;#39;t matter. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Question 1: A month ago, I fingered myself (Is that the correct term?) in the arse and it .. went well. I managed to get an entire finger in there, and I was quite happy. Although, I didn&amp;#39;t have any lube (Still don&amp;#39;t) so I had to use water but it worked. The whole experience was fine.
