I'm wondering if I could get your advice on this. 

On thursday, I went out on a date with a guy (for the sake of the story I'll call him Tom, age 30), I'm (26). We hit it off, he's been to my hometown, we work in the same field, it was a good dinner and conversation flowed easily. He brought me back to his place and we watched some tv, but mostly made out for about 40 mins or so. I went back home and sent him a text ""Hey, it was great meeting you! I had a good time, have a good night."" he replied ""Hey, I had a good time too, sleep well and have a nice weekend, ttys"".

We didn't text on Friday

On Saturday I went to this dance party at a club with two friends. We were dancing, having a good time. Then one of my friends spots one of his' friends, waves at him and this guy comes over. It happens to be Tom (the guy I went on date with) he comes up to us, not realizing I'm there yet, and he's holding the hand of this other guy. He's slightly surprised when he sees me, but smiles and gives me a hug.

I wanted to talk to him, since I really liked him, but it was loud (club setting, dark) and well he was sort of dancing with this other guy off to the side. But I kept thinking of ways to get close to him. I signaled to everyone that I was going to get a drink, hoping he'd follow me, haha...but no luck. I got back to where my friends were, with my drink in hand and Tom and this other guy were full on making out, and groping, hands sliding under shirts and all... I just played it cool and kept dancing with my friends. I left maybe about 30 later, by the time I was gone, I think Tom and the guy he was with had left too. 

So these are the things that I know. It was 1 date, so I'm completely aware of the fact that we owe nothing to each other and there is no exclusivity. It could have been me in his place, if I had gotten lucky. Although I don't know if I'd make out so openly in front of the guy I just went on a date with, but maybe I think that because I was somewhat hurt and wished it was me he was making out with. 

I don't know if to text him later today just to see how his weekend went. Although I feel kinda dumb doing that, cause I know how it went, he got lucky haha. And also because well, he was clearly aware that I saw him hook up with this other guy, and this might be a way of saying he's not interested. I'm thinking I should just wait to see if he texts. 

I'd like to think he was interested because I thought we had a good dinner and he could have been more short or cold with his text and why would he have invited me to his place to make out? But maybe he just wanted a hook up. 

Please let me know what you think. And honesty is appreciated but try to be nice haha...

Quick update: He texted me Sunday night: ""hey! crazy running into you! hope you had a good time"" i replied ""yeah, what a coincidence haha..and yeah, it was a good time""...and that's about it, no further texts. Not really interested in pursuing anything, so I'll just leave it at that","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys, &lt;/p&gt;

Realized it was because I was gay and never confronted myself about it. Just this past year I kind of fell for a friend and it was a real eye-opener for me. Things didn't turn out well, at all. I've had to cut contact with this friend because of all the shit he'd put me through. I saw him as somebody I deeply cared for, and I think he did as well at first. He went on to go out with someone else and I think he's developed true and stronger feelings for him. However, every once in a while he'd text me VERY flirtatiously. Pics were exchanged. Being new to the whole gay dating world, I took it to be a signal that in fact he still wanted to be with me on a relationship level. When I asked him, he told me he cared for me as a friend, and was just doing so for shits and giggles. He told me that two friends, or even strangers, can do that, or have sex without being anything else to each other.

I feel, and felt used and naive. I've since installed all the dating/hookup apps and realized he was behaving in the exact same callous manner that's expected there. So here goes the question:

Q: Is anybody else disenchanted with the way gay dating is structured? I'm only recently getting acquainted with it, but it seems like there are no rules; nothing is expected from anyone and it seems so cold and distant.

I'm really disheartened about the prospect of finding someone at all. It's not at all like heterosexual dating. For me, it seems worse on every level: People generally expect open relationships, the first thing they ask you is if you're a top or bottom, and you might have to deal with one or both of you being closeted. It's a fucking pain.

Can somebody talk me out of this way of thinking or at least offer some insight?

Thanks!

We've set very clear rules on what we are to do if we plan on hooking up with other guys. We have a system of messages that we send each other if we are in fact in the process of hooking up, that way we both know that are safe and not in any kind of danger.

So far, neither of us has actually hooked up with anyone, and we've only been with each other. 

Today we both went to a gay bar, and while we were there, we were talking to this guy, and my boyfriend was being clear that he thought the guy was hot, and that he'd like for the both of us to get with him in a threeway. 

The guy was wonderful. Attractive, normal, just an all-around nice person. Probably the best situation for us if we were looking for a third. So I went with it, and we made it happen. 

I've been in threeways before where I was single, and I was joining a couple, or I was just joining two other guys. Never had I been in a threeway where I was in a relationship with one of the participants. 

While it was happening, and we were all making each other feel good, I started getting in this really bad headspace. I watched this guy make out with my boyfriend, or suck him off, and I didn't find it hot. It just made me feel bad. 

At this point, I'm feeling myself sink into this depression. He's stated that he had a lot of fun. I've tried being positive saying that the thrill of finding this new person and making it happen was fun. 

Maybe I'm not ready to have an open relationship. Maybe I'm feeling too protective of this person that I have genuine strong feelings for.

I don't know. Has this happened to others before? Am I being a buzzkill on this?

Thank you.

Anyway, after I came out with the Facebook post, I started talking to an old friend who is bisexual. For the first hour or two, the discussion was... normal. We talked like friends. However, it all changed when he finally came out and said that he's had a crush on me for 4 years. At that point, our discussion became more emotional. He asked me if I'd like to go to his house tomorrow (which was today), and I accepted. He was saying things like ""I love you"" and ""I want to cuddle with you"", and I was silly and replied to him in the same fashion. He even asked me out. However, about an hour after doing this, I was honest with him and I told him that we have to calm down a bit; I let him know that I was completely okay with getting to know him again, but I felt like we were rushing it way too fast.

So all of that stuff happened... After hours of trying to fall asleep, I finally slept and got up to get ready to go to his house. We met at a nearby park, and we walked to his house. At first, everything was fine; we both love to play games so we were doing that for the first hour or so, and then we swam in his pool for a bit. We went back inside to watch some Youtube videos, and that's roughly when he started to cuddle and kiss with me.

When we cuddled and kissed, I didn't feel any... significant emotion. I was nervous as hell for sure, but I didn't feel any attraction to it. I REALLY wanted to have sex with him (especially when he laid on top of me; with his clothes on though), but I didn't feel ""love"" when I kissed and cuddled with him. Overall, I just wanted to have sex with him and have ""deep"" talks with him. I think the sex idea would be bad though because he claims that he really likes me, whereas I'm kind of conflicted about it. I don't want to use him. Overall, after today, I kind of just want to be friends with him, but I'm skeptical that that could potentially change.

What do you guys think I should do? 

**TL;DR** I met a guy at his house after coming out on Facebook; he claimed that he had a crush on me since I was 14. I went to his house the day after; we played games and went into his swimming pool. A bit later, we started to cuddle and kiss; however, I didn't feel any ""love"" emotion towards him when this happened. I wanted to have sex with him very bad, but I'm assuming that's only because... I want sex. I don't want to use him though because he claims that he really likes me.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;A ~day ago, I made &lt;a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/2aeqdu/i_took_gay_bros_advice_and_came_out_on_facebook/""&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; and I received even more support from you guys.

I have been doing my research on PrEP/Truvada as a method to prevent catching HIV. I don't have any problem taking a pill everyday. I am going to talk to my doctor next week and see what she says. 

Why I want to take PrEP/Truvada:

1. I'm a bottom.

2. I don't always use a condom. 

3. I am not in a monogamous relationship. 

4. Its just one more method of prevention. 

Depending on what my doctor says I plan to try it out for a few months. I'm just wondering if anyone has taken it and if they have had any side effects?

If you haven't heard of [PrEP](http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/prevention/research/prep/) check it out.

Well she got to matchmaking pretty quick and set me up with a tall black guy named Jay. 

We chatted a bit online and had our first meeting last weekend. We played mini golf and he was really fun! But.... we went to a bar afterward, had a few drinks and I ended up going back to his apartment. We had a few drinks at his place and before you know it; I'm blowing him.

We've been texting all week and plan to meet up tomorrow night, but I'm not going to lie, I'm a little scared.

- 1) His ""member"" is HUGE. The only two other guys I've hooked with were average size, but Jay is massive! 

- 2) He's a little aggressive. I kinda like it, but I'm worried he won't be gentle during my first time. 

I really want to do this (he's soooo sexy), but I don't know how to handle my first anal 'fucking'. Do I need to use an enema? How does this all work?

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve been texting all week and plan to meet up tomorrow night, but I&amp;#39;m not going to lie, I&amp;#39;m a little scared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) His &amp;quot;member&amp;quot; is HUGE. The only two other guys I&amp;#39;ve hooked with were average size, but Jay is massive! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;2) He&amp;#39;s a little aggressive. I kinda like it, but I&amp;#39;m worried he won&amp;#39;t be gentle during my first time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really want to do this (he&amp;#39;s soooo sexy), but I don&amp;#39;t know how to handle my first anal &amp;#39;fucking&amp;#39;. Do I need to use an enema? How does this all work? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any advice would be a big help!&lt;/p&gt;

I'm 4.5"" so I've always ended up bottoming just because of my partner's size, but I'm trying to get out of that cycle. I haven't really topped that much before, so I'm pretty self-conscious about it given my size. On my last hook-up, we couldn't quite get cowgirl position to work, so that was pretty embarrassing on my end.
