I know this is a bit off topic but I figured someone might be able to help. :)

I've just started having this problem on and off today. I'll be on Grindr or Scruff on my iPhone and suddenly I'll be taken to the app store to download some free game. It's the same thing that happens when you click a banner ad but without actually having clicked the banner ad. It happens continuously as well, so much so that it's impossible to even reply to messages. It's incredibly frustrating!

Is there something up with my phone or is this happening to other people

Also, sorry for the typo in the title.

Edit: Just in case anyone does have this problem, I think I've found a temporary fix for it. 

Go into settings -&gt; General -&gt; Restrictions and make downloading apps restricted. It means you can't access the appstore but it's easy enough to turn off should you want to. If anyone else has a more permanent solution, it would be hugely appreciated! :)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys,

I met a guy on an app about 7 months ago.  In the beginning we chatted a lot and then we met up and we became friends.  He was chatting to other people arranging dates etc. while we've been friends.

One night, I was around his city and asked to stay over and he said yes. We cuddled that night but the next day he asked why I was frigid. I knew he wanted sex and I was ready to fuck him but I wanted more because I think I was attracted to him. He told me we will never be more than friends which made me sad but **I rather have him as a friend in my life than not at all.**

So, we continued to chat and I made effort to see him as he lacked transport which strengthened our friendship because we have a lot of fun. He stated seeing this guy who lived far away and I guess I got kind of jealous and thought about regret if I didn't pursue my friend further. So, 6 months after the initial I told him I liked him I told him again. 

He said he gave me plenty of signs but I don’t think he really did. His type of men is black hair and brown eyes, his last two exs were Asian.
He’s told me he feels sad and weird about this situation and we virtually don’t talk any more. I told him if he doesn’t want to be friends he should let me know but he said it’s my choice. 

During these last few weeks, I’ve ask him how he is and other generic questions but he just blanks me now; this is the hurtful thing. He hasn’t blocked my number, told me to leave him alone or deleted me of facebook. I still see him on dating apps and he hasn’t still single.

So basically I’m asking is it possible to repair out friendship or should I just leave him alone?

I hooked up with this guy I had been talking to for quite a while now. We've been doing some pretty hardcore flirting, sending each other sexytime photos and videos. 

We played around for the first time today. He's really into rougher sex, which I don't have much experience with at all, but am open to. Lots of biting, scratching, hair tugging. I actually got really into it. 

We didn't do any oral, but we did end up fucking with him topping me. He came and got cleaned up pretty quickly. I didn't get to orgasm, because I wasn't really even hard for most of the time we were hooking up. 

I'm super bummed because I dig the guy a lot and it was really fucking hot, but my little guy just was not showing any signs of wanting to come play. 

Maybe I was just really nervous with the roughness and not having been topped in over a year? Regardless, I was super embarrassed. Luckily, this guy is into me and wants to try again. I'm afraid that if that doesn't go well that it probably won't go any further. 

Any advice?

We met in high school and have always had a very strong sexual bond... but it has truly always been sexual only. We started hanging out in a Spanish class and chatting and ended up playing video games after school one day. From there we hang out a lot and went to the movies and skipped school together sometimes just to fool around. Back in high school we used to hang out as friends in the day time but we practically lived with each other at night because we've always had raging hormones for each other. From high school, we incidentally ended up going to the same college [totally didn't plan this.] Therefore we continued the FB status all the way through college. 

During all that time, Tony has always dated the hottest girls. He always classified himself as straight and really wanted to keep our secret FB status very secret. I had absolutely no problem with this as an ugly guy hooking up with a hottie on the reg. He was always known as the really fit and really cute guy that all the girls wanted to get with. He has always dated the hottest and smartest girls in high school and college.

Tony and I never really talked about our own relationship statuses because honestly we never cared. We are what we are, we meet up, fuck, maybe cuddle and watch a movie, simple stuff. We never really talk much, this is strictly sexual and nothing else. I was sad when Tony moved away to Oregon but he does often visit our college town for work and we hook up when he's in town, which is at least once a month. 

Last night Tony came over because he's in town, and I notice he was wearing a wedding band. I asked him about it... not because I wanted anything further from him but because I was concerned that he's cheating on someone significant with me. I value the sanctity of marriage, and I believe when you make that commitment it is different from the college dating flings that everyone goes through. I asked him about it and he says he got married last year and has a baby now with his wife. 

I'm all for our FB status, but I hate knowing that he has a wife and child back at home and I just have bad feelings about this now. I asked him if he hooks up with other guys, and he swears that I am the only guy he has ever been with. He explained that he really appreciates the sexual bond we have and would never want to ruin it. He says he's not attracted to other guys or sex with other guys, only me, and that I am his first and only guy ever since we started fooling around in high school. He says he wife has no idea and he doesn't think he's hurting anyone by keeping our thing going.

I am **absolutely fucking torn.** On one hand, I have this guy who I've been very sexual with and attracted to for 9 years, and on the other hand I am helping him cheat on his wife. I've been single and not pursuing relationships with anyone else during this entire time.

To be clear, I am not upset that he he is now taken or anything.  I am only feeling weird about this now because I now know that he is married and has a kid. What am I supposed to do here? I don't want to be a homewrecker :(

**TL;DR - Just found out that FB of 9 years is married. Our connection is strictly sexual. I feel like I'm part of a problem now because he is cheating on his wife with me. What am I supposed to do?**

I get the impression that it's kind of a taboo topic now, despite him not having any political/religious/strong feelings against homosexuality. We've talked about relationships a few times, and I would test the waters just to make sure he was still okay with it. Something like him saying a pic of a girl was nice, I'd say she was pretty hot too, and maybe comment on a guy in the background jokingly - he'd just clam up and move on, really.

We talk, like, CONSTANTLY online, and play games together... We don't meet up as often as I'd like, but when we do, it's in a group. I panic a lot about my same-sex friends thinking I might *like* them, so it was pretty hard for me to genuinely ask him if he wanted to meet up for lunch after college. He kind of left it as ""maybe, maybe not"", and never got back to me - I didn't want to seem creepy, so I left it, and we never bothered.

 I realised that this was a frequent trend, and it was all related to situations where he might be alone with me... It kind of stung. We get along great when we talk in a group or online, and I'd like to be better friends with him now that college is almost over. I should mention that we're both painfully-awkward sufferers of social anxiety, to the point of being rendered paralysed by the thought of speaking in front of class.

Am I reading too much into this? I have no idea how to bring it up with him without feeling like a creeper, or pushing him further away.

Any tips for how I should go about this? Thanks a ton, bros. And once this goes down, I plan on coming out to two friends (slightly older girls) that I have known my entire life, too. As for family, that can just wait until I have someone in my life.

I had trouble fitting my screening questions into a normal conversation with this particular guy and one thing lead to another very quickly... now every time he gives me the once-over even I want to scream ""IT'S A TRAP"". So I already feel like a heartless liar and will not, as far as I can help it, be going this far with anyone again without having disclosed.


Personal info: I'm 25, trans male, on male hormones for 7 years, I've had my chest reconstructed, no surgical alterations done to my junk, but my parts are hormonally masculinised. I'm athletic, not girly, not gay sounding. You wouldn't pick me for gay, much less trans, so I'm sure my guy has zero clue.


I've known my guy for about 6 months and have been dating him for the past 4 or 5 weeks. We haven't done anything where I've taken my underwear off, but I've given him head a few times amongst other things...  I think we'd both consider what we've been doing to be fucking. He started calling me his boyfriend at some point so I guess that's where it's at... He's 23, a total sweetheart, chatty, gay. I can't tell if he gossips or not, he's said a few things, but nothing that'd make me think he'd pass on something marked as 'secret' so far.


I wish it was as easy as, ""psst, I'm a transsexual,"" but it's not. I work with him, and I need to know he appreciates confidentiality because I don't want my gender questioned at work. I got enough weird vibes after a female colleague outed me as gay to everyone in the building.


He's either going to be into it or not into it, that's probably already set and there's nothing I can really do to change his mind. My issue isn't convincing him that he really should want to bang me. What I need to do is break it off if he's a) Openly not into my kind of configuration and/or b) Might out me at work. It'd be an understatement for me to say that I'm into him, so I don't want to just break it off because I'm having trouble reading him.

My usual screening process is to bring up a number of topics and gauge my partner's response. Sometimes it's easy and right away a guy will let me know that he couldn't be into someone with a small cock|is super into the smallest of micro penises, or feels ill if female organs are brought up|is bisexual. My guy though, we always seem to have something to talk about and we never end up in 20 question land where I can hurl hypotheticals at him. I bring up small cocks and I get a ""I don't think you have anything to worry about"" with a subject change, and all I know about his opinion of female junk is that his older sister would have violent mood swings and send him out as a kid to steal tampons from his friend's mother's house. He has next to no knowledge about trans anything, so questioning him directly about if he considered trans guys to be guys ended up with a google search and a ""I don't think she looks like a guy, or her, or her...""


I guess I've already decided I'm probably just going to tell him what's up, somehow, but I don't know what to expect. Well, that's not true, I'm kind of expecting a ""I feel betrayed and lied to."" That's how I'd feel. What I'm asking you guys is, if you were in his shoes, what could I do or say to soften the betrayal blow? Should I be apologetic about not having told him? Should I just let him take down my pants and act like I thought he already knew/it's not big deal? Should I invite him over and leave suspicious things around so he'll ask about them?

I got enough weird vibes after a female colleague outed me as gay to everyone in the building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s either going to be into it or not into it, that&amp;#39;s probably already set and there&amp;#39;s nothing I can really do to change his mind. My issue isn&amp;#39;t convincing him that he really should want to bang me. What I need to do is break it off if he&amp;#39;s a) Openly not into my kind of configuration and/or b) Might out me at work. It&amp;#39;d be an understatement for me to say that I&amp;#39;m into him, so I don&amp;#39;t want to just break it off because I&amp;#39;m having trouble reading him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My usual screening process is to bring up a number of topics and gauge my partner&amp;#39;s response. Sometimes it&amp;#39;s easy and right away a guy will let me know that he couldn&amp;#39;t be into someone with a small cock|is super into the smallest of micro penises, or feels ill if female organs are brought up|is bisexual. My guy though, we always seem to have something to talk about and we never end up in 20 question land where I can hurl hypotheticals at him. I bring up small cocks and I get a &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t think you have anything to worry about&amp;quot; with a subject change, and all I know about his opinion of female junk is that his older sister would have violent mood swings and send him out as a kid to steal tampons from his friend&amp;#39;s mother&amp;#39;s house. He has next to no knowledge about trans anything, so questioning him directly about if he considered trans guys to be guys ended up with a google search and a &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t think she looks like a guy, or her, or her...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess I&amp;#39;ve already decided I&amp;#39;m probably just going to tell him what&amp;#39;s up, somehow, but I don&amp;#39;t know what to expect. Well, that&amp;#39;s not true, I&amp;#39;m kind of expecting a &amp;quot;I feel betrayed and lied to.&amp;quot; That&amp;#39;s how I&amp;#39;d feel. What I&amp;#39;m asking you guys is, if you were in his shoes, what could I do or say to soften the betrayal blow? Should I be apologetic about not having told him? Should I just let him take down my pants and act like I thought he already knew/it&amp;#39;s not big deal? Should I invite him over and leave suspicious things around so he&amp;#39;ll ask about them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How would you want this kind of thing handled? How would you react? Would you be inclined to out someone as revenge?&lt;/p&gt;

I have a lot of questions, some sex related, others not. I'll try to split them up into sections to make organization easier. I also might be a bit direct/vulgar in my terms of speaking, hope you don't mind. 

**Ass Play**

I've been experimenting with anal fingering for a few months right now. Feels absolutely fantastic, but I figured I would ask some more qualified people (you guys) for tips/advice. Of course, I am the only one that really knows my body, but I figured some pointers couldn't hurt. Toys are (unfortunately) not an option, since I can't order them online because my mom works from home, and I don't think a sex shop would be too fond of a 16 year old in their store.  

1. Positions? Currently I've only tried lying flat on my back, and doggy-ish style (knees and shoulder/head keeping me up). What is the optimal position for you guys?

2. Should my fingering arm be reaching between my legs, or should it be reaching behind my back to the hole? Also, I assume my non-dominant hand (left) should be doing the fingering, and the right on the dick. Just confirming.

3. Touching the prostate itself. How should I be rubbing/poking it? Currently I do a circular motion on it, or just moving in a vertical line. Also, should my finger be pistoning in and out of my ass? Right now I just leave it stationary and let the fingertip do the work. Also, how much pressure should I be applying? 

4. Lube. Before I did any butt stuff I would always just use saliva to fap. Never really needed lube. First few times I stuck a finger in my ass I used saliva as well. Took a good ~10 minutes each time just to get a finger in there. While it was good, I knew I needed some lubricant. Searched around the house, found a semi-empty bottle of hand lotion with a thin layer of dust on the outside. Looked like it hadn't been touched in ~6 months. Seized the opportunity and used it next time the situation arose. Felt 300 times better and was so much quicker too. Well, fast forward to about two weeks ago, the lotion has run out. Searched around the house for a replacement, found another bottle of lotion, mostly full and was a different brand. The three times I've used it I got that feeling like after a huge shit where your ass is burning. I've resolved to stop using it, but I really don't want to go back to using spit. Nearest Walgreens is about 10 miles away, and I don't have access to a car for a few months. Can't order something online either because my mom works from home and would find the package. I need something for lube before I go crazy, because normal masturbation is so boring now. Suggestions?

5. Frequency? How often should I be doing anal play? Pre-experimenting, I was fapping pretty much every day. Now its once every two days, but the climaxes are so much better. Should I be doing a 'standard' session one day and butt play accompanying it the next day? 

6. Permanent stretching. I know the anus retracts itself to normal size after a few hours, but it is a pain working it back open every time I want more than one finger in there. Any tips for permanently stretching the opening?

7. Is anything else supposed to feel good around the anus? In most of the erotica I've read there's usually a part where they just feel around the opening to the hole without actually going in, and it apparently feels good. I haven't really understood that. Is it just a Pavlov association effect, where every time they know something's going in their ass, it rubs the entrance first, so they get pleasure from that? Or is there actually an inherently good feeling about it?

8. Also, what about inside the anus? The only thing that really feels good is the prostate. It's sort of nice to have the 'full' feeling, but everything else just feels like poking normal skin, no real pleasure. Am I missing out on anything else in there?

9. Sort of relating to 7 and 8, rimming? Does the tongue actually hit the prostate, or does it just feel mildly pleasant as it moves around? Or is the main purpose just for a lubricating effect?

10. Any general tips on self fingering, or anything else you feel like mentioning? 

edit: not really butt related, what about nipples? I assume it feels better when someone else is messing with them instead of yourself, but some opinions here would be helpful too, I suppose.

**Bisexual and gay interaction**

Being a ~4 on the Kinsey scale, interacting with gays in the future is likely going to be an important skill for me. I've heard quite a few stories of biphobia among the gay community over in /r/bisexual, but I honestly think it's some sort of confirmation bias by them or something. What does the gay community, in general, *actually* think about bisexuals? If one were to get into a relationship with a gay man, would coming out as bi be a good idea? Should you let them know you're bi early on or immediately? Not tell them at all unless its a serious relationship? Is this just something that needs to be determined on a case-by-case basis?

**Coming out**

Now, this section may be better suited for /r/bisexual, but I feel like I might as well put it here anyway. Being bi really isn't the biggest deal in the world to me, and I really don't understand why some people are so afraid of coming out (unless their parents are heartless homophobes or something). I'm already out to all my close friends, and even a few regular friends, but none of my family know. The ones that know are all cool with it. My family *should* be supportive of me still, so I'm not really worried about that either, but the situation hasn't arised where I *need* to tell them I'm bi. Now, **I know that coming out as gay is totally different than bi.** We sort of have the 'option' to blend in as a straight person. I totally understand that coming out is a lot more significant to gays because you don't really have that blending option, and you don't really know what you're going to be met with when you come out.

Anyway, would it be a good idea to be out as publicly as I can? Or should I lurk in the shadows and only come out to a select few? I'm not really looking for a gay relationship right now (mainly because most of the ones at my school are asshats), but I will definitely be seeking one once college rolls around. 

**Final question**

This is something I've been asking people every time I find a good opportunity. How are you able to only find one gender attractive? Why is 50% of the population automatically undesirable for sex just because they have the wrong parts? What is it about women that are a turn off for you guys?

Not trying to be asshole-ish, sorry if it comes off that way. I *accept* that some people only like one sex, but I don't *understand* it. I'm really curious as to why someone could only enjoy one.

If you only want to respond to a few questions, go ahead and do that. Feel free to mention anything else if you'd like.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello, bi bro here.
