They were bar hopping the whole night, but last call around here is around 130. They ended up going to the strip club because it's the only ""bar"" type area around here that's open past 130. They were all hanging out and having a supposed good time until this guy starts trying to talk to my boyfriend (all of these things are what i've heard from him and his roommates). He brushed it off, told the guy he has a boyfriend and kept hanging out with his friends. By the time his roommates took him back he didn't understand what had happened, but everyone knew something was wrong because he was acting completely weird. He hadn't drank that much and is usually super outgoing, talkative, and near impossible to make be quiet, especially when he's any kind of drunk. His roommates literally had to carry him inside to his bed. At the time, nobody knew what had happened to him but over the course of the next couple of days they knew he had been drugged.

Basically the guy that came up to him kept pestering him throughout the night. He wouldn't leave him alone, kept insisting that my boyfriend try some drink. My boyfriend (who now fully understands that you don't accept alcohol from strangers) tasted this guys drink because the guy kept insisting. After that everything was kind of off. While my bf was in the bathroom, the guy walked up behind, grabbed the back of his neck and told him that he was going home with him. Thank god one of his roommates walked in at the time it was happening and put a stop to it. 

Several weeks pass and I told my bf that if we were ever out and he saw him again that I needed to know. I had to say something to this asshole. I wasn't able to let this guy just get away with something like this. Fast forward to last night, we were out at one of the bars having a good time. We left, went to a couple of others, and then ended up back at the bar we started at. My bf was with one of his friends while I was getting a drink, and he walked up to me and told me that the guy was there. He pointed out to me which one he was, and it took everything within myself not to make a huge scene. I was trying to wait for the right time to mention it to him when he was alone because he was hanging around some girl the entire night. He ended up grabbing his jacket and leaving while I was standing at one of the tables with my bf and one of his friends. Right as I saw the guy leave I left and started walking after him and this girl. (I was pretty drunk at this point which didn't help very much). I caught up to him and I basically told him that I knew what he did. I didn't mention my boyfriend's name, or what happened at this point. He said something along the lines of ""is this about bf's name?,"" and seemed to know exactly what I was talking about before I mentioned it. I knew he was a guilty prick and basically told him that he was lucky I wasn't there when it happened the first time. I told him that I better not hear from my bf anything more about him. The alcohol was kind of speaking because i'm not usually one to get in someone's face but I was furious. I said some other things about how he was an asshole, but I can't exactly remember everything I said.

Point of the story: do you think I acted in the right? How should I have gone about this? How would you have handled this situation, and if I see him again should I bring it up again?

My bf was a little frustrated because he wanted to avoid conflict and forget about the guy which I understood, but I felt like I had to say something. I know my bf was a little relieved at the same time and appreciated that I did say something. Anyway, thanks for reading.

I got the Grinder app and finally found someone I was comfortable sharing my first gay sexy time with ( I'm 25). He came over, we finished watching futurama, I took him to the guest bedroom.
 
Then we started kissing and touching. Followed by swapping head and then swapping being tops. He came first then everything sort of stopped. He got dressed then I walked him to the front door. I never got to come and he didn't offer anything after he came.

The next day I messaged him on Grinder and he seemed to have liked the experience and said he wanted to do more things. I sent him my cell number (I don't like getting on Grinder). 

The question is: if he texts me do I give him a second chance? When I am with a women I always make sure she gets off first. Thought this was standard protocol. I made it clear in my profile I wanted to be friends with someone not just a booty call. At this point I haven't gotten a boner since this and I think he made me more straight from that experience. How do I handle this? Is it fairly common? Thanks","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys,

My partner and I both have very demanding jobs.  Sometimes it's hard after coming home from a long day of work to find the time to get intimate, normally on weeknights we settle for half-assed half-asleep blowjobs if anything.

The problem to me, is that when we do have the time (aka the weekend), we generally fill it with other activities, so we don't get to have as much sex as I'd like.  My partner is fine w our current sex life, but I want it more often.  When we both were in school still, we had tons of time and an incredibly fulfilling sex life.  Now it is an afterthought.

Let me just lay it all out, and see what you guys think. I was in a long-term relationship (6 years), which ended in 2010. From 2010-2013 I was pretty much a hermit and dating/men was not on my radar. Since the beginning of this year, I have turned my health around (I really let myself go). I started working out again, lifting, eating better. So far, I have lost about 40 lbs and am continuing to better myself. This is what I look like now:

Anyway, I have put myself out there again for dating and such. I have been on a handful of dates and I get a good amount of attention from guys. I am frequently told that I am good looking/handsome/attractive, whatever.

However, I can't seem to get myself out of this thing where I constantly devalue myself and question my worth. As a result of this, I am always seeking attention/validation from men. As you can imagine, this is not healthy and its bothersome to me.

I told a friend once, that no matter how many people tell me that I am attractive, a catch, whatever it may be, the first person to come along to tell em differently or reject me, will rock my confidence seriously and have me questioning.

Any advice?

I have been wasting more time on Grindr (because when you are in the closet that's the only way other gay guys even exist) and obviously get ignored as soon as I send a pic...really helps the self-esteem you know? I get that I am pretty much the only non-white guy in this city, and am barely average looking but, sometimes I wish I didn't have to that person.

I feel super alone but don't really feel like hanging out with friends, because firstly they are all girls and I feel like the odd one out, and because I hate continuing being on self-censor / careful all the time. Can't be out because financially / emotionally not ready to be disowned by my family who I live with for school. 

Need to workout, but don't have anyone to show me how to do anything (see: lack of male friends) and no matter how many videos I watch online exercises seem too complicated and I end up going to the treadmill whenever I manage to brave the gym. Which means I can't even bulk up to negate the rest of my unattractiveness. 

I have no idea what the fuck is happening when I graduate this year, I have no goals, hate my degree and have only a small chance of getting into the professional school I applied for because my marks went to shit this year.

Like I have never had a relationship because it took me so long to figure out (not that I have gotten there 100%) that I actually like guys, only done hookups since closet = no relationship. Hooked up with guys who were nice but who I did not find attractive at all, because I don't get to be picky obviously.

I first wanted to thank this subreddit for being so loving. The amount of supoort, and the amount of people messaging me, made me cry. I usually bottle up my feelings, but the fact that so many people showed their love made me feel so wanted. Thinking about you guys brings a huge smile to my face.

Now, to the update, 

The pact few days have been hell. My mother has been waking me up at random hours of the night, screaming at me. She's been yelling bible stuff at me, and is getting her opinions/views based on Wikipedia. 

After trying to reason/talk about to her, she decided to kick me out. I have 6 months to find a new home. I'm in school and I havnt been able to work, so ill have to take a break from school until I can get on my feet. The idea of giving up on school makes me physically sick to my stomach.

It's been hell though and I really need to move out and get on my own. I have a friend who wants to move out as well, so we talked about looking at apartments together. 

I don't know what to do at this exact moment, and I'm still working out plans, but I thought I would let you guys know that my suicidial thoughts have gone away.

Thank you for the love and support.
It's what's keeing me strong; its what's keeping me going.

After two weeks of fiddling around with smaller toys and gently playing with larger prostate massaging toys, I found my prostate, and figured out how to make it feel good.

No, not good - GREAT! 

At first it was just the feeling of being... full. I would insert the prostate massager and stroke myself, and I would cum, and I would cum fast. The orgasms that way lasted longer than normal. I even fucked my wife while I had it in - I lasted about 5 strokes in her pussy before I came. But even still, it wasn't the total deal - I was missing something. The source of the orgasm was still my cock.

Today, I played quite a bit with my smaller toys - small plugs that I would put in and out of me, as though someone with a tiny dick was fucking me (this is when I discovered that goddamn it takes a LOT of lube to keep things wet in there. I stopped using water based and am now using silicone based - better, but still not perfect). The fucking sensation was ok, but the toy was just too small... So I brought out the curved massager, and put that in.

I moved it all around while gently touching myself, until I hit on this spot where I felt like I had to pee, but suddenly it felt more than that - like a sprinkling of pleasure I had never felt before. Thinking I had the spot, I placed one of my most powerful vibrators against the toy, and cranked it up as high as it would go.

Oh. My. God.

The pleasure was crazy. I had never felt anything like that before - my abs were flexing and jumping me around like crazy - I had no control over it - it felt so damn good! and it was building to something, and something HUGE... Every time I thought ""ok holy shit the damn of pleasure is about to burst"" it would crank up to another higher level. Precum was oozing out of my cock - but it was only semi hard and I hadn't even touched it!

Then I started to move the massager, with the vibrator on it, back and forth, making it fuck me, and fucking eh the damn burst. I can't even describe it, but my body locked up/exploded with an overwhelming pleasure - it went on for a good 20 seconds, then settled down. I never ejaculated on it. so... I knew there was more to come... (no pun intended)

I rested for a few seconds, with the vibrator away from the toy, and just let my body relax. I noticed then that the massager had worked it's way all the way in to me (never had gotten it all the way in before) and I felt no discomfort - nothing but good. 

I put on a porno to watch, and pulled the massager around until I found that spot again... and I put the vibrator back on it. It started to build again - fast. But this time, I didn't have a huge explosion - it got to a certain point and just stayed that way - which was fucking awesome. 

The porn I put on was this white guy with a huge dick fucking a hot black girl (Bi but I tend to favor women the most. Sorry guys). I started having the massager fuck me in the same rhythm he was fucking her, and at the same time I stroked myself. 

I was pretty soft at the beginning, but I got hard fast - 3 strokes in. And the very moment that I got all the way hard, I came. This was an orgasm even more intense than the last one - cumming from deep within me and from my cock at the same time. I sprayed cum all over my chest, abs, bed - it was everywhere, and holy fuck it was a lot.

It was weird too - when I cum, normally its pretty white and thick. This was thin and completely transparent - no white at all. Is this because it was just prostate fluid??? 

Even after I came that way.. I honestly felt like I could go again, like that normal ""OK you are done for at least 15 minutes"" feeling never arrived.  I wanted to keep going, but I had to get ready for work. 

I want to do it again, but I am almost out of silicone lube. Does anyone have any recommendations for lube? something that lasts and doesn't get sticky the way water-based lubes do? 

When it comes to anal, is the real deal penis fucking you better than any toy/vibrator combination? I'm curious only, My wife isn't into 3 somes and I'm deeply committed to her, so I won't really ever know what its like - but I would love to hear what it feels like and how it's different.

And thank you to those who have helped me get to this place. I now know why anal sex is so damn awesome - and I cannot wait to get in there and try that again!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well my brothers, I have found the promised land. After two weeks of fiddling around with smaller toys and gently playing with larger prostate massaging toys, I found my prostate, and figured out how to make it feel good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, not good - GREAT! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first it was just the feeling of being... full. I would insert the prostate massager and stroke myself, and I would cum, and I would cum fast. The orgasms that way lasted longer than normal. I even fucked my wife while I had it in - I lasted about 5 strokes in her pussy before I came. But even still, it wasn&amp;#39;t the total deal - I was missing something. The source of the orgasm was still my cock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I played quite a bit with my smaller toys - small plugs that I would put in and out of me, as though someone with a tiny dick was fucking me (this is when I discovered that goddamn it takes a LOT of lube to keep things wet in there. I stopped using water based and am now using silicone based - better, but still not perfect). The fucking sensation was ok, but the toy was just too small... So I brought out the curved massager, and put that in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I moved it all around while gently touching myself, until I hit on this spot where I felt like I had to pee, but suddenly it felt more than that - like a sprinkling of pleasure I had never felt before. Thinking I had the spot, I placed one of my most powerful vibrators against the toy, and cranked it up as high as it would go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh. My. God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pleasure was crazy. I had never felt anything like that before - my abs were flexing and jumping me around like crazy - I had no control over it - it felt so damn good! and it was building to something, and something HUGE... Every time I thought &amp;quot;ok holy shit the damn of pleasure is about to burst&amp;quot; it would crank up to another higher level. Precum was oozing out of my cock - but it was only semi hard and I hadn&amp;#39;t even touched it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I started to move the massager, with the vibrator on it, back and forth, making it fuck me, and fucking eh the damn burst. I can&amp;#39;t even describe it, but my body locked up/exploded with an overwhelming pleasure - it went on for a good 20 seconds, then settled down. I never ejaculated on it. so... I knew there was more to come... (no pun intended)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rested for a few seconds, with the vibrator away from the toy, and just let my body relax. I noticed then that the massager had worked it&amp;#39;s way all the way in to me (never had gotten it all the way in before) and I felt no discomfort - nothing but good. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put on a porno to watch, and pulled the massager around until I found that spot again... and I put the vibrator back on it. It started to build again - fast. But this time, I didn&amp;#39;t have a huge explosion - it got to a certain point and just stayed that way - which was fucking awesome. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The porn I put on was this white guy with a huge dick fucking a hot black girl (Bi but I tend to favor women the most. Sorry guys). I started having the massager fuck me in the same rhythm he was fucking her, and at the same time I stroked myself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was pretty soft at the beginning, but I got hard fast - 3 strokes in. And the very moment that I got all the way hard, I came. This was an orgasm even more intense than the last one - cumming from deep within me and from my cock at the same time.

It's funny. You keep telling yourself you don't have a heart, then something like this comes along and surprise, you've still got one.

At first I didn't really notice him, but after some time I catched him staring at me. At first I didn't think much of it, but this has happened several times and more frequently as time passed by and I got curious since he is really attractive (10/10 tbh) and 100% my type. (note: this whole thing started 1 1/2(!) months ago)  

As soon as I'm getting on the train he looks at me for 1 or 2 seconds  and then he starts to look out of the window or talk to the people he sits next to. Every time he gets up he looks at me for about one second, not at anybody else. 

Coincidentally we get off at the same station and when he is walking in front of me he sometimes looks to the right/left and glances at me in the corner of his eyes. He once left his phone on the seat and managed to get it in the last second, which was the only time I talked to him for like 10 seconds about this incident. 

Last time we parted ways I looked back because I wanted to get something out of my bag and he just stared straight into my eyes and said ""bye"". I have no idea how to approach the situation, since he also seems to be a bit older than me and I normally get hit on when I'm out. 

Am I reading too much into all this? I feel lost for the first time because of a guy. A friend of mine suggested I just sit next to him, but since he is with 2 other people that get off one station before us it's kind of hard to do. Normally I visit bars/clubs with my friends and it's fairly easy to get the hint there and talk to people for me, but here it feels impossible.

What should I do? How do I approach this guy?

TL;DR: guy giving me strange ""signals""?, no idea how to approach the situation, need help.
