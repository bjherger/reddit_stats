This is a throwaway. I'm 16 and I got myself into some shit.

Anyway, a few months ago, I got myself grindr because I was bored and thirsty. I now know how wrong that is. I know that was a wrong move and I regret that. But I met a guy who told me he loved me after talking for like 10 minutes and being the thirsty 15 year old I was, I told him I love him too and we jacked off on skype together. I know that's wrong. I know someone could've gotten arrested. I was really thirsty and hungry for acceptance. I fucking love how he made me feel but I knew I'd have to break it off with him. Eventually, I did - not because I knew it was the right thing to do but because the magic faded and I got sick of it.

This past week, I've been craving for that feeling. I unblocked him and added him back and the same thing happened. This time he told me this was my last chance. I don't know what to do with him. I don't know what to do with myself.

The Grindr team specifically say on their Support page that for iPhone users, only you and Apple can manage subscriptions. For some reason there is no ""Manage Subscription"" button when I view my Apple ID, both on the iPhone and on PC.

I've submitted a ticket to Grindr Support as to why the App does not appear under Manage Subscriptions, and as this is my first purchase on the App Store, there is no Manage Subscription button available for another App.

For those here who have purchased and are/were subscribed to Grindr Xtra on iPhone, are you able to Manage your subscription? These guys sure go out of their way to hide this setting to ""force"" you to continue subscribing. It's pretty sneaky, but no surprise for Grindr.

Also, some say that going under Settings in the Grindr App &gt; Grindr Xtra Store, there would be a way to cancel your subscription there. Mine only shows how many days of sub is remaining and gives you options for new plans that you can purchase.

I've even removed my payment information on my Apple Account, so I wonder if they will still charge me on credit -- I used a Master Debit card to purchase in the App Store and now removed that information from my Apple Account.

Edit: Should I contact Apple Support about the App not appearing under ""Manage Subscriptions"" and the button not appearing on my Apple Account altogether?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week I decided on a whim to purchase Grindr Xtra in the App Store for $1.30 without realizing that you&amp;#39;re automatically subscribed upon the purchase until you cancel it. The Grindr team specifically say on their Support page that for iPhone users, only you and Apple can manage subscriptions. For some reason there is no &amp;quot;Manage Subscription&amp;quot; button when I view my Apple ID, both on the iPhone and on PC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve submitted a ticket to Grindr Support as to why the App does not appear under Manage Subscriptions, and as this is my first purchase on the App Store, there is no Manage Subscription button available for another App.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those here who have purchased and are/were subscribed to Grindr Xtra on iPhone, are you able to Manage your subscription? These guys sure go out of their way to hide this setting to &amp;quot;force&amp;quot; you to continue subscribing. It&amp;#39;s pretty sneaky, but no surprise for Grindr.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, some say that going under Settings in the Grindr App &amp;gt; Grindr Xtra Store, there would be a way to cancel your subscription there. Mine only shows how many days of sub is remaining and gives you options for new plans that you can purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

I need help.

Short backstory: we're 2 bi guys, aged around 30. We've been in a relationship for over 2 years. We met online and started as FB's until one day, exactly a year after we met, he shocked me by asking to become BF's.

Now, he's been telling to move in together, signing up a lease, and maybe even more. I was really considering about agreeing, since over the past months, I've been feeling different about him. It's not just mere attraction like it was when we met, or even that I simply care about him, but something stronger. After much soul searching, I realized I'm madly in love with him.

So, after a nice night a couple of weeks ago, as he was getting ready to sleep, I simply said I think I love you. And he stared at me and said, you guessed it, thank you.

The next time we met, he seemed to pretend that everything was the same, but I could tell that he was, well for lack of a better term, awkward. I don't know if he noticed it, but his behaviour was very different, almost if he were uncomfortable being in the same room as me. It's like he just wanted to say hi how are you and then run in the other direction!

Coincidentally, I came down with a cold and haven't seen him since. I'm feeling better now and we're scheduled to meet next week. We've been texting, but the elephant in the room is being blatantly avoided. To say that he's been asking about my health and then chit-chatting about the weather would be putting it mildly.

What surprises me is that he was the one who wanted us to become BF's. He was the one who suggested (and still wants) to move in together. He is the one who, supposedly, wants the relationship to grow even more.

And I said I love you, he said thank you, and started acting weird. Really weird.

So bros, as you can see, I'm extremely confused. What should I do? What should I say? Should I run away like he apparently wants to himself? Or should I just move in with him and simply avoid the subject for ever &amp; ever?

Thanks in advance.


EDIT1: I'm starting to suspect that, when he talked about upgrading the relationship, he meant something like let's get a dog. Or a car. Or maybe I'm just confusing myself even further.


EDIT2: Thank you bros for your kind words. I now know that I have to go straight to the point and ask him why is he acting like this. I need to think what to say to him. I guess it's better to wait until we meet next week rather than doing it by text, or should I just go for it?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello bros.

Some time ago I acted on my impulse and hooked up with a 17 year old (legal here, FYI) that was looking for a first time. Sexually speaking was amazing, but later I felt like shit. I realized that I cared little about his enjoyment and also went in bareback. So, yes, I’m a piece of shit. 


Since then, I refrained from even messaging them. I just sit in my living room and jack off to some porn.


Do you think I should see a professional? What should I do if I want a normal romantic and sexual life? A friend of mine suggested to find a boyfriend that is willing to spice up things in the bedroom by bringing in a young guy, but that sounds very creepy.

&lt;p&gt;Since then, I refrained from even messaging them. I just sit in my living room and jack off to some porn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you think I should see a professional? What should I do if I want a normal romantic and sexual life? A friend of mine suggested to find a boyfriend that is willing to spice up things in the bedroom by bringing in a young guy, but that sounds very creepy.&lt;/p&gt;

What a fucking whirlwind. The day before yesterday, he informed he met up with the type of guy he's looking for. Older than his own parents.  He is absolutely head over heals this guy. I was flabbergasted. I felt like I was being pranked or punk'd or whatever. Who the fuck abuducted the rational, logical man that I fell in love with and who loved me back so passionately and replaced him with this confused little boy? 

The news of him finding someone so soon and so ""perfect"" for him hit me like a truck. I was a bawling mess.  After I put on my big boy pants, I started looking at it rationally. This man he's started seeing works in the psych field and is well-respected in the community. If this guy has any moral fiber and worthy of the training he's received in his field, he would see that this is a bad idea a mile away. Culturally, logistically, and just age-wise.  But, it's out of my hands now. My ex will have to figure this out on his own. And if it works out, and if he's happy, that's awesome.  

In the mean time, I spoke with a counselor. The result of that is that my ex and I had another discussion, this time about boundaries. We are not to sleep in the same bed anymore but I'm ok with him living here until the lease ends. I told him acceptable ways we can interact and what's not OK. He understood. I'm finding that I am ok with interacting with him (eating meals and watching TV together and stuff), but I told him if for some reason I can't handle it, I can change my mind at any time.

Yesterday and today, I started feeling better. The healing process has begun for me. I've hit the gym, started hanging out with friends, and stuff. I fired up my profile on dating sites and apps, but I am just not ready to date right now. Maybe one day.

It feels like my body rejecting it and my stomach cramps and hurts. It has happened three times. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this normal? Do I just need to keep trying? I don&amp;#39;t want this to happen to me with him, of course...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks :)&lt;/p&gt;

My parents apparently don't understand the concept of privacy and have walked in on me masturbating frequently.

I've gotten it to the point where i can completely exit out of anything questionable I'm looking at and tab to something more ""appropriate"" just judging from the sound of them coming, but I still get this nervous Deer in the Headlights look and I can tell they know exactly what I've been doing.

I know it doesn't really matter and it doesn't affect our relationship at all, but it really freaks me out that they can tell I was JUST choking the chicken like five seconds ago.  It makes me really anxious for the next couple hours.

1. How do you tell if a plug is non toxic or not? It said non toxic on the back, and now (20 minutes later) it's not hurting or anything but I don't know if the butthole rot (?) will set in later. Only really worried about it because it was made in China in some sketchy factory, and I'm not sure if I trust the Chinese manufacturing industry's rigorous health and safety standards with my health. I'd really like it if someone can help me out on this one, just for my peace of mind haha

2. Is it OK, as a gay guy, to not be huuuugely into the butt stuff? Like, it was alright I guess, but I'm not, like, fiending for the next session. I don't know if the fact that I wasn't a huge fan was down to me not shitting beforehand, but I'm not really a top. Does this make me weird or am I overthinking things?

3. If the butthole rot does set in, what the fuck do I do? On one hand I'm in the UK so the NHS can help me out I guess, but on the other hand I'm so deep in the closet that I'm currently chilling with Aslan. 

4. Does the smell of santorum go away quickly?

I live in an area where there's not exactly a whole lot of options for gay men. As in, more cows than people for about 50 miles in any direction. I don't have a whole lot of friends to begin with, so I started using Hornet to at least try to meet people (tablet, no smartphone, so no Grindr for me) and expand my circles.

Even with that, there weren't a lot of guys that close to me (30 miles became my new definition of ""next door""), but there was one guy who was closer by and that I seemed to have some things in common with, so I hit him up. Turns out we have a lot in common, so we met up to hang out. That turned into a date the next time, and now we're at a point where a label seems appropriate.

The thing is, as much as we have in common, he's not exactly what I'd call hot. It's not a problem in the bedroom or anything - it doesn't take a lot to get me ready to go - but... I don't know how to put it, I don't find myself staring at him or thinking about what he looks like or anything.

Granted, I'm not the most premium physical specimen: skin and bones and facial features that look best covered in a bag. And he's super into me, which is a nice confidence booster. But I'm starting to think that there's a good chance that this is just a relationship of convenience for me, that maybe I just want a boyfriend and not necessarily that I want *him* to be my boyfriend. That maybe I'm just keeping him around because I don't think I've got a chance at anything better.

Help me, internet, you're my only hope. I'm a little lost in my own thoughts.

I’ve been looking at new places to live since I’ll be homeless next month. So, the situation with the university is – it’s too late to register for the upcoming academic year at my current university, and I don’t have the requirements to transfer to the universities in Austin. With that considered, I’m looking into moving out of state and finding a different university to attend. I have very little time to do this since I will be homeless in about four weeks.
Looking at cities and possibilities, I haven’t found a lot except for Seattle. Seattle has a nice community college system and it’s possible for me to transfer into University of Washington after some time there. Ideally, I would apply for their community colleges, spend a year filling up transfer requirements and becoming an in-state student, and then applying for a transfer.

There are some roadblocks that are in place (regardless of city, really). Being really young, I don’t have a substantial credit history, and typically need someone to co-sign on a lease. I also don’t have a job lined up (without a degree I don’t think that’s even possible) so meeting the typical “income exceeds rent 3x” requirement will be difficult. Thus, my remaining options… are probably just finding a roommate on craigslist or through other roommate matching services I’m not familiar with. I really don’t have room to be picky about stuff, but I would like to try and find a safe area that’s connected to the seattle train / bus systems.

It’s a lot to go through my head. Finals are coming up, so is homelessness, I’m still depressed and totally overwhelmed by all this. Being alive really sucks. But anyways, if someone could help me out with this process as I try and work out a solution, I’d appreciate it. Anyone here from the Washington area?

He definitely enjoyed it too, but my best friend had just passed away and I was really depressed and going crazy at the time. This led me to not leave him alone for the weekend, and finally I did until Thursday, when I called him and he said he didn't think it was going to work out.

So after that it was going well, and about a week ago, I see him on Grindr again. I text him, but no response. Later that night, he texts me saying he was just kind of freaked out by me a while back, but my ""cock and ass had him reconsidering"". Unfortunately I passed out right before he sent the message. The next day I say sorry I passed out and we trade snapchats, and send a few nudes back and forth. I ask if he wants to hookup. No response. I leave him alone for most of the week, one time asking if he was Instagram (no response).

Yesterday, I finally texted him this:

* You wanna hang out later? (3:09pm)
* You seemed down last week... Not anymore? (5:12pm)

(12:30-1am)Very drunk now, and I honestly should've stopped earlier

* Were you just drunk last weekend? If you didn't change your mind just tell me man. I don't know what you're thinkin 
* And the first week we talked by best friend passed away that's why I was acting so weird 
* Sorry dude I know it's not your problem (all within half an hour of each other)

Today I texted him at 1pm saying ""I guess I'll try one last time. Don't know why you won't even give me an answer"".

I know this seems fucking insane and I'm hating myself for it. The only problem is that it has me feeling extremely depressed and miserable. I'm lusting after him so hard and haven't even talked to him for more than 15 minutes after hooking up once. It makes no logical sense and I hate that I'm acting like a crazy bitch about it.

[Update 2 under account #1](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2y87kp/am_i_28_m_being_coldhearted_and_harsh_with/)

So I finally found a job! Which is great, and my partner found work in the form of a couple of side gigs (he is helping gay hoarders organize their huge mess, he is painting as well - although I don't think he will actually sell anything, not because they're bad, but because he doesn't want to. He is also making meals and delivers them to people!

So it's great that we finally have positive news. I've also made huge strides in setting up our lives here (bought a car, increased my credit score, trying to find deals on furniture, etc.). So things are moving in a good pace, albeit it is stressful because I am trying to get things done but also trying to score good deals on everything! lol


My partner wanted to start contributing and I said he should start when he saves up his first $1,000 at least. I wanted him to get into the habit of just keeping money on his hands instead of him being perpetually broke.

Anyway, so we've made strides. However, I've also noticed that there is a lot more attitude, sadly. For example, I will start my new job on Monday, so I've been at home for the past 10 days, in these period I bought a used car and got a good deal, dealt with registration, getting my DL and auto insurance. In addition to other things. For some reason, he now thinks he is the breadwinner and therefore I need to have the home spotless by the time he comes back and I need to have a meal prepared as well. 

Which is interesting except I've yet to erase a dollar off his debt. I am not sure that my partner knows how this thing works? (Or maybe I'm being a douchebag?) 

Also, we still bicker over the small details and issues (basic communication issues, inability to make a decision together - what couch to buy?) and many other cases.

Writing this, it all sounds whiney but it is draining. I am really tired. I am stressed by the move, lonely that I don't have my best friends around me, tired of constantly having to finish one thing after the other, and now a bit depressed because I feel that I am stuck at home with someone and it won't grow further than this...

I'm not really sure what do I need to do next. Do I wait things out and see if things improve and get better? Do I just make it clear that there is no future between us? Do I proceed cautiously?

PS: I really need to sort out this double account thing. I guess I didn't want my partner to ever notice the NSFW subreddits I am subscribed to in this account.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/2zbshf/am_i_a_younger_version_of_a_sugar_daddy/""&gt;Original&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
