So for the past days since I wrote this, I've been having to deal with my ex looking at my profile on the gay app pretty much daily. The app has a feature which shows you who has looked at your profile and when, and he checks mine daily. He also is offline a good 95% of the time, so that while I browse the app frequently when I'm bored, I haven't seen him online since he first appeared. It seems like the few times he does go online, which is usually for less than a minute, is to mainly check my profile, though there have been a couple times I've seen him on there without a new view.

I also agreed to meet him over lunch to try to be friends again. We we're both pretty nervous but it seemed to go well. We didn't talk about the relationship at all, and I didn't mention his views of my profile. We just kept it to what we did over the summer and how our first week back at school has been. I was surprised by how easy it was to talk to him as a friend, and I wouldn't be against a friendship, but these mixed signals that I think I see, like the views on the app and other things, are just really frustrating.

Again, any advice would be greatly appreciated.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;link to original post: &lt;a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/2e9qsi/ex_wants_me_but_doesnt_want_me/""&gt;http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/2e9qsi/ex_wants_me_but_doesnt_want_me/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Been on a couple dates and go to gym regularly with him. Last night I invited him to have drinks with my friends and I and it went pretty well, they thought he was a pretty cool guy. We got to the second bar after about 2 hours of being out and he told me that he was really tired (it was like 8.30pm) but mentioned that he was going to meet up with his friend at another bar..ok? He told me earlier this week that he didn't have any plans on Friday night and would like to join us for drinks. 

I'm not sure what it was but I was pretty disappointed and didn't feel like speaking to him that night and the entirety of today. He messaged me today to ask how I was feeling and I gave him a pretty basic response that would hopefully hint that I was upset. He apologised for bailing early last night, same reason, so tired etc. I then messaged him this:

* *me: can i ask you something?*
* *him: yeh?*
* *me: do you like only want to hang out as mates?*
* *him: hmm i dunno, I quite like you*
* *me: okay I wasn't sure cause we haven't really progressed anywhere from just going out on dates and gym..*
* *him: hahah*  (WTF?)

I'm so confused atm, he kept messaging me about the restaurant he's eating at tonight to change the subject I assume and my reply was pretty much 'cool, enjoy'. It honestly seems like too much effort than what I feel like it's worth. He says he likes me but his actions don't back up his words. I don't want to sound like a cunt but I've turned down other opportunities to hang out with other guys and even my friends just to see him or because I don't feel right doing it. I use to like him a lot but now it feels as if it's never going to go anywhere at this fucking pace. 

tldr; asked this guy if he had feelings for me and he said yes, I say why I feel as if he didn't and he replies with ""hahah"". Im confused.

I hope you are doing well. I have been following and reading posts for a while but, now, it is finally the time to create one myself. And... I need some help.

I am 24 yo, and I have been living in Spain for a couple of months. It has been a quite challenging experience as I don't speak the language that well, what makes it very hard to meet guys. So, one day, a guy that shares the same nationality as me messaged me on Grindr. And we decided to go to a Gay bar that night. While he were there, one of his friends arrived and I couldn't take my eyes out of him. Just... gorgeous. We started talking and he spoke English really well, what surprised me even more. Unfortunately, I had to leave as the Metro was going to close soon. That same night, my ""Grindr Friend"" fooled around with him. 

1 MONTH LATER

 My work contract ended and I am enjoying some vacation days before moving to the UK. And... yesterday, I got an alert from Tinder saying I had a match. Guess who? The gorgeous guy from the Gay bar. I usually don't pay attention to the guys on Tinder, so I didn't even notice it was him when I ""liked"" his profile. I message him immediately asking if he was the guy I was thinking off. He confirmed and suggested that we should go for a drink this afternoon. I accepted, of course. 

When we met, we had this awkward moment as I gave him my hand for a handshake but, usually, gay guys here in Spain say hello giving a kiss on the cheek and I am still not used to that. So it was basically a handshake kiss. Haha. We went to this really nice bar and had an awesome time. Of course, I had to tell him that I am leaving in the next couple of weeks and etc. I paid for the bill (it was only some drinks and I wanted to be courteous) After the bar, we walked around downtown and had a lot of things in common to share. We spent almost 4 hours together and then he had to leave to have dinner with his family. When we were saying goodbye, it was really awkward again. This time he gave me his hand for a handshake and we kind of hugged so I don't know what happened really. Haha

The thing is... He is hypnotizing. And I do think he is a bit out of my league. I kind of interpreted his handshake as a ""friends only"" or ""you are nice, but just friends"". He is really handsome and he knows that. The thing is.. I don't know what to do. I'd really like to spend more time with him before I leave. I don't know if he decided to set up some boundaries after I said I was leaving the country soon or if he thought that I wasn't good looking enough for him. I know it sounds silly, but I want to see him more times before I leave, but... What should I do now? How do I know if he was into me or not? Should I message him or wait for him to? What is usually the next step after the first date? I am sorry to be asking all of these questions but I am still fairly new in dating guys and that's why I am asking for your help, bros.!

TL;DR: Talked with a guy at a gay bar. Matched on Tinder 1 month later. Went on a first date. Nothing happened but I really liked him and want to see him again - not sure if he wants (how can I be sure?). The problem: I am moving from the country - and he knows. The next step?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello, bros. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you are doing well. I have been following and reading posts for a while but, now, it is finally the time to create one myself. And... I need some help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am 24 yo, and I have been living in Spain for a couple of months. It has been a quite challenging experience as I don&amp;#39;t speak the language that well, what makes it very hard to meet guys. So, one day, a guy that shares the same nationality as me messaged me on Grindr. And we decided to go to a Gay bar that night. While he were there, one of his friends arrived and I couldn&amp;#39;t take my eyes out of him. Just... gorgeous. We started talking and he spoke English really well, what surprised me even more. Unfortunately, I had to leave as the Metro was going to close soon. That same night, my &amp;quot;Grindr Friend&amp;quot; fooled around with him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 MONTH LATER&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My work contract ended and I am enjoying some vacation days before moving to the UK. And... yesterday, I got an alert from Tinder saying I had a match. Guess who? The gorgeous guy from the Gay bar. I usually don&amp;#39;t pay attention to the guys on Tinder, so I didn&amp;#39;t even notice it was him when I &amp;quot;liked&amp;quot; his profile. I message him immediately asking if he was the guy I was thinking off. He confirmed and suggested that we should go for a drink this afternoon. I accepted, of course. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we met, we had this awkward moment as I gave him my hand for a handshake but, usually, gay guys here in Spain say hello giving a kiss on the cheek and I am still not used to that. So it was basically a handshake kiss. Haha. We went to this really nice bar and had an awesome time.
