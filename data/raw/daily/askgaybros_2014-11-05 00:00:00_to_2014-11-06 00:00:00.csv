I hope you are doing well. I hate stereotypes, but I actually have a question regarding the personality and behavior of British guys. I have recently moved from South America to the UK and I am living in a not very big city. I have been talking with guys on Grindr and other Apps frequently. Still, I have been finding extremely hard to meet these guys in person. I was supposed to have dinner with a nice guy tomorrow and he just messaged me cancelling the dinner. The problem is that he is the 5th guy in a row that I was supposed to meet for a first time that ends up cancelling. It is extremely frustrating. I ended up building expectations, thinking of what to wear and everything and suddenly... it is just cancelled. It seems that they always find an excuse or something happens Some of them didn't even bother to tell me. If I hadn´t messaged them a couple of hours before, I would probably end up at the place by myself. Am I just unlucky or it is indeed hard to set up dates with british guys? I even started thinking that I might be the problem, or something. Still, in all of the cases, they were the first ones to message me, my Instagram is public and everything. Could you please give your insight, specially if you are from the UK? Thank you :)

TL,DR: Trying to meet guys has been extremely hard here in the UK as they always cancel. It has happen 5th times in a row with five different guys. Is this cultural or am I just unlucky?

Still haven't announced that I'm gay/bi.

I met him in June 2013, we would hang out when he can (he's so you call anti-social, would rather just sit and play PlayStation than do anything else). He used to love football a lot, and that's where I met him (a tournament), but now, one year after, he's completely changed. 

When I met him and most of last year he would come close to my face causing me to blush, would get touchy (cheek to cheek would be completely normal), he would act completely relaxed and comfortable around me, but when I met him a couple of days ago, he was... different. Although we would never meet, and the same went for his friends (as I said he'd rather sit at home or with his family), we would talk on the phone every week, and we were on good terms. 

For the last 4-6 months I would ask him if he wanted to hang out or something and he'd just say no and then go out with his school friends.

When I met him two days ago He just sat on his phone, shamed/picked on me at everything I said, he was hostile, a prick in general. He'd ask me about restaurants, and when I said I didn't know them he would reply ""I don't know you anymore ugh you're so stupid"" over and over again. Before if I replied like that he'd either reply 'haha you're so stupid' in a jokingly manner or he would eagerly explain the restaurant to me with a full smile. He then told me that he'd rather go with his school friends because I was boring (mind you he just sat on his phone, looking through silly GIFS and showing them to me. I knew his sense of humor was quite silly and bad, but I didn't think it'd be this bad), and he did. For every single Thursday, when I used to ask him all the time. He told it straight to my face. He used to be so nice, innocent and genuine. I told him (on WhatsApp because he left early) that he'd either treat me like he used to, to by me classy best-friend or to not know me, for real. ""All or nothing"", I said.

Expecting it, he chose nothing then blocked me.

Was I too harsh on him? His father is a great person, his mother is a very caring lady. Maybe his school friends are the reason for this? I don't know. What I knew that time is that I was angry, maybe at myself for letting him be like this. I really don't know.

Using a throwaway just in case!

I started dating my boyfriend a little under two years ago.  He was fun-loving and sweet and a little naive about the gay scene, so it was fun doing things like taking him to his first gay bars and introducing him to new things!

We didn't talk about politics for a while.  I'm not super political but liberal for the most part, and for some reason, I just assumed he was too.  I haven't met many gay Republicans, and the handful I did were very up in your face about it, like it made them special or something.

One day about a two months into the relationship, we were talking and he made a snide comment about Obama.  I forget what I said, but it was something like starting to regret voting for him?  And he was like whoa no way!  I never voted for him, don't blame me for this mess!  I asked who he voted for, and he said McCain and Romney.  I was surprised and flat out asked him what he identified as politically, and he responded that he was registered Republican.  I thought that was interesting, but dropped the subject because it was too early in the relationship to discuss politics.

Over the next year, he became more and more open with me about his beliefs, positions, and plans for the future.  It turned out he was much more conservative than I thought.  Which is fine - I mean, I never expected anyone to agree with me 100% politically.  But the thing that became most troubling was when he started sharing his plans for the future.  He's a lawyer now, but he admitted to me that he only went to law school because he wants to be a politician someday.  I initially dismissed this as an oh sure, whatever you say type of comment.  However, I've realized over the past year and a half that he's dead-set on this path, and it's more of an inevitability than a dream he talks about.

First I began to realize that his family was pretty well off (more so than I thought at least) and had some political connections.  Then over the course of the last year, he's dragged me to ""events"" which turned out to be GOP fundraisers, and he spent a lot of time talking to some kind of important people.  Side note, Republican fundraisers are not as bad as it sounds - everyone is actually really, really nice and cool about us as a gay couple, at least to our faces.  No one mentioned any anti-gay stuff at all, even in speeches.  But the speeches are usually filled with ridiculous conservative dribble and self-serving and racist bullshit.

I couldn't keep going to these because it angered me so much, though.  I hated the messages and the intolerance and the snide comments, not about me but about Democrats and Obama and others.  It's basically a circlejerk, and I hated it.  

In a nutshell, this election season made me see an entirely new side of him.  He's super serious about running for something, probably within the next six or eight years from what he admitted to me.   I want to support him, but I just can't.  I feel like I'm betraying what I stand for.  I'm not an overly political person, but something about this feels wrong to me.  The more I hear how dismissive he is of the lower class, urban populations, and immigrants, the more I start to doubt our relationship.

That's not even considering the constant barrage of GOP events and other things he'd ask me to tag along to.  I told him that I don't agree with this politically, and he said, ""I'd never force you to come, but I love it when you're there with me.""  Then I feel bad and end up tagging along more than I should.  If I stick with him longterm, it would get even worse.  I can't imagine running a campaign with him and having that be our life 24/7.

Is this enough to end the relationship?  I don't know what to do.  My mom thinks I should just stick it out, because we're on the same page in many other aspects of life and she says I might not be able to find someone better lol.  My best friend says that she thinks I should dump him.  My other good friend reminded me that I can still support him without getting overly involved in his politics, which makes sense I guess.  I just don't know how easy that will be.  I also don't want to commit to this now and realize six years down the line that I made a huge mistake.

Some rational third party advice would be great!  What are your thoughts?  Should I give it more time?  I think now that the election season is coming to a close, it will be easier to deal with.  But at the same time, I'm afraid that we'll get more serious and then it will be harder to resolve down the line.

If I stick with him longterm, it would get even worse.  I can&amp;#39;t imagine running a campaign with him and having that be our life 24/7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this enough to end the relationship?  I don&amp;#39;t know what to do.  My mom thinks I should just stick it out, because we&amp;#39;re on the same page in many other aspects of life and she says I might not be able to find someone better lol.  My best friend says that she thinks I should dump him.  My other good friend reminded me that I can still support him without getting overly involved in his politics, which makes sense I guess.  I just don&amp;#39;t know how easy that will be.  I also don&amp;#39;t want to commit to this now and realize six years down the line that I made a huge mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some rational third party advice would be great!  What are your thoughts?  Should I give it more time?  I think now that the election season is coming to a close, it will be easier to deal with.  But at the same time, I&amp;#39;m afraid that we&amp;#39;ll get more serious and then it will be harder to resolve down the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God, I&amp;#39;m stressed out!  Please please help!&lt;/p&gt;

When I met James he was in a relationship with Tom. At some point James and Tom tried to have a threesome with me. At the time I wasn't really interested in casual sex and didn't take them up on the offer. 

A month or so after that they ended up breaking up. After they broke up, James and I started hanging out a lot and flirting. I asked him on a date and he said he was pretty much just interested in casual sex and not a relationship. I know that James and Tom still hang out every few weeks and James still casually mentions Tom when we are hanging out, so in pretty sure there are still residual feelings.  

Over the weekend Tom texted me and was being super flirty and I was back. He asked if I wanted to hang out some time and I said yes. I'm 99% sure he's just looking for sex and not to actually hangout. 

I recently gave up on trying to find a steady relationship as a gay guy in my young 20's and have decided to embrace the hookup scene. I do want to ""hang out"" with Tom (and if the offer came up again I'd have the 3some) but I also would still like to be friends w James.

I'm in one now that's been going on for the past 2 months. And, two weeks ago, for the first time in my life, I cheated. It was with a friend of a friend, we met each other at a bar and I went home with him that same night. We were both wasted, and he hasn't talked to me since (he knew I had a boyfriend). Now, I have a serious dilemma. Do I tell my boyfriend or not?
  
  I know I fucked up big time. Cheating has always been something I told myself I'd never do. I've been cheated on before and I forgave my ex, but it still hurt me deeply at the time. I don't want to hurt my boyfriend by telling him what I did, and I also don't want to lose him over a stupid mistake. At the same time, I don't want to hide anything from him. Especially if this ends up being a long-term relationship, I don't know if I could keep hiding it for more than a year.

 Something that has me extra-nervous is that I didn't use a condom (but he also didn't cum inside me). I recently tested negative for HIV and syphilis, but given the 1.5-3 month window period, I'm scared I could infect my boyfriend if I now have HIV. This is probably my main concern in whether or not to tell him. Considering the statistics, I have a 1/370 chance of being infected at this very moment. The odds are in my partner's favor, but if I *am* infected and I *do* infect him, I could never forgive myself.

Going under an anon profile because I'm kinda saddened that I can't come up with my own solutions for this, so I want any of your input please.

I won't drag this out. Basically, Me = 21, postgrad student, average looks etc, I've been out (and trying to date/hang out and see what happens - via the typical apps) for the last 14 months. Of that time, I've met 5 different guys where there was potential (not in my head, but was suggested or implied by the other guy) but it died within 1-3months and soured horribly as a result. The end product; a very frustrated, offended, and insecure me. 

So like anything, I get back up on the horse and try again, but it's always the same end; chat guy, meet guy, get on, ask for second meet up (I hate to say ""date"" because guys tend to be scared by that word), maybe that happens, but then I get ""oh I'm not ready"" ""oh I want a fuck buddy"" ""I'm not interested"".

Happens once or twice, that's life. But all the damn time? That seems unlucky or more to it? Basically, it leaves me feeling pretty awful about myself like ""Am I really that ugly?"" ""why doesn't anyone be honest or upfront?"" ""what am I doing wrong?"" ""what can I change to appeal to more people?"".

It's hitting breaking point over these last few weeks where no one talks back to me on grindr, actually no one over the last three weeks and I'm not a fussy person for chats, I'll talk to everyone! The only people who talk are creepy old men who send dick pics after ""hey"". So I'm left thinking ""I'm that undesirable that no one will even respond to a cheery hello"".

Basically guys, I feel pretty worthless. but I want this feeling to stop. I don't want to mourn when some profile doesn't respond to me, but I'm letting strangers on apps determine my self worth. Hell, today I bumped into the last guy who I had an interest in (same college), and he straight up blanked me. Once again, felt terrible in myself.

So guys, any tips/words of advice would be truly appreciated. Feeling this way ain't right or healthy but I just want a pathway to rectify it.

I apologize in advance for the poor structure, I'm typing this all on my phone. I Didn't really know where else to turn for advice since my go to guy is the one this is about. 

The other night my good friend (who identifies as straight, I should add), who is also my roommate, got pretty wasted at our house with another friend. By the end of the night everyone had passed out besides my good friend and me. 

We went to the livingroom to watch some TV or play Xbox or something, but before we even had sat down he looked at me and said ""you know sometimes I wish I had a friend who I could just have sex with and it wouldn't be weird."" Now, any other time I would take that as a move but in the past he had made it clear that he was straight when I told him I liked him. I kind of gave him a blank look because I didn't know how to reply. Before I could he pushed me onto the couch and started to dry hump me. Things started to get pretty hot n horny and suddenly he was naked and I was giving him a blow job. At this point I asked if we should go to my room, and we did. He started making out with me, like hardcore. I say that sincerely as I feel like it was one of the best make out sessions I've probably ever had. He asks me if he could fuck me and I let him. All of a sudden things slow down and he falls asleep on me. Which I think, whatever, he's wasted, what do I expect. I roll over and try to fall asleep but he keeps humping me, in his sleep, and kept saying his ex-girlfriend's name, this really turned me off and I had to just ignore it and fall asleep.

Fast forward to about 4 am. He wakes up and then wakes me up. He asks me ""why am I naked?"" In my grogginess I just pretended not to know and he went off to his room to pass out. The next day we're driving in the car together and I ask him how much he remembers from last night. He says that he doesn't remember much more than drinking in the kitchen all night. I ask him if he remembers waking up naked in my bed, and he gets really confused and asks if I know why he did. I tell him I have no idea. 

I know I could just ignore it all, but it's been eating at me. He asked me the next day who gave me that hickey on my neck, to which I wish I could just reply ""you, dumbass!"" The entire time he seemed really into it, and I've always had a crush on him, so it's just really confusing and its putting a lot of guilt on me. Did I take advantage of him? Is he pretending not to notice because he's closeted? Any advice at all would help.

TL;DR: Had sex with best friend who identifies as straight, he doesn't remember, I feel guilty.

It all sounds great on paper, but though I haven't spent much time with him yet (and he's done nothing to encourage these feelings), I feel like a loser compared to him. It's not for lack of trying.

What it comes down to is that I don't know if I really stand a chance with this guy when I feel so... *intimidated* by him. It's emasculating. Can anyone who has been in a similar situation talk to their experience? Did it work out? How did you get over it? What issues did you face? Any advice?
