First off, any gender or orientation has my unconditional support. I love and hate everyone equally.


I'm a straight male dressing somewhat extraordinary, I love colors and I love patterns. Occasionally, I linger at autonomists places (usually clubs) which innately have a high ratio of gays, lesbians, transsexuals, whatever.


On first sight, I may seem gay, and I'm sure there's even friends who do think I was. It frequently happens to me that males start tête-à-tête conversations to me. I enjoy conversations and love to talk to anyone as long as it runs, so I board the plane of community that get's me high.


There's no need of fooling ourselves, in clubs, talking to strangers is often sexually motivated. I don't want to state it's the only case, but as chats continue there's more or less certain verbal or unverbal signs. From time to time, I'm sure or not so sure, but to date this doesn't affect my behavior in this interaction. I go on and still enjoy chatting. Should I intervene here? If so, how do I carefully state that I'm not interested without hurting anybody, and include that I'd like to keep on talking and may be looking for a new friend?


Some step further, and maybe foreseeable, there's clear actions like leaning forward or touching arms, or even pushy kisses. This is the moment I back out. I decided for myself that there's no reason to excuse, it's more like a ""You won't have a chance with that, but I support you in any way"" With this, it seems like I point out that there is something special about it, although I don't think it is. It is just the circumstance that keeps me from going on and I want them to know that there wasn't a chance from scratch, that it's not ""Yeah, you could have done better..."".


Is it too late? I still don't have a problem with this, but people mostly withdraw right now and I get the feeling that it's awkward for the both of us.


Now I'm asking for your expertise, do you have any suggestions what I can do different? When to do this?

Was wondering what your opinions are on if there is a gay male equivalent of getting someone flowers is, and if you think there is, what that equivalent item is.

It's obviously one of those things that (straight) couples do when he's done something wrong and wants to make amends, or he's giving her a gift that isn't actually a 'gift'...but is there an equivalent for a guy in a gay relationship to give to another guy?

I personally would be happy to receive flowers and chocolates or something from a SO, but I'm not sure if I'm in the minority. Are y'all happy to receive flowers from your SO or is there something else that you usually give/receive instead?

Thanks all.

He said at the time that he thought he was bicurious, but woke up the next morning and basically said it was all a drunken mistake. Which I'm fine with - it happens. I decided to just act as normal, and treat him in a friendly manner. While Fresher's Week is all about clubbing, I decided to let him figure himself out, and spent two days afterwards clubbing with people other than the flatmates, which has left a bit of a rift between me and the others also.

Give it about a couple of weeks later, and he refuses (when we're alone together) to either say anything to me or respond when I say something to him. ""Hey, how are you today?"" gets met with a glare, then him turning his head away like a diva. I have to live with this guy for a year.

My question to you guys is, how do I respond to that? I'm a patient person, and far from confrontational, but I'm edging closer to literally just going up to him and asking ""What's your fucking problem?"". I've tried subtly hinting at that already (i.e. via Facebook message, where I said the equivalent of ""If you want to talk to me one-to-one about anything, just let me know"" etc.).

Recently, a bit of a thing happened where our neighbours were being noisy, so I texted the other flatmates at 5am to give them the security number for future reference. Every one of them thanked and complimented me, except for him, who strode up to me and said ""You don't fucking text people at five in the morning, you'll wake them up!"". No-one was woken up by it, not even himself, but he felt the need to argue it based on principle. I saw his point (even if I didn't care), but I was indignant. First time in weeks that he actually says something meaningful to me, and it was to complain (he has a reputation for being a Negative Nelly).

He was drunk yesterday, and I regret not opening things up with a snide comment then. Even when drunk, he just says ""I'm drunk"", which I translate to meaning ""Stay away from me"" after previous such encounters.

So, GayBros, I'm at my wit's end - I've tried being nice and normal, I've tried approaching him kindly about the issue etc. I couldn't care less about how he feels towards me, but there are times when I literally go up to the communal kitchen, see only him in there, think to myself ""I'm not in the mood to fucking deal with this"", and turn away. I've avoided eating in, and tend to eat out a lot more. The tension also seems to have been picked up by a few of the flatmates, from what I can tell, but they don't know what's going on to my knowledge.

**EDIT 1** - Just found out off other flatmates that, while he's certainly been acting more of a jerk towards me than others, his behaviour isn't impressing anyone. People plan to gradually let him know, one by one, that they're unimpressed by his behaviour.

I've only had one gay experience and the person turned out to be a horrible guy, it didn't put me off but I'm a virgin when it comes to guys.

It's hard to say, but as much as my self confidence isn't great, I know I'm pretty good looking, I've dated girls before and had steady relationships during that time of my life. So I don't know if I have to act gay to be liked, I don't know if it's bad for me to say but all the members were a classic over the top out and proud about it, lispy sort of guy, but I'm nothing like that. I even got accused of not being gay and being called a breeder which is the most bizarre back handed insult I've ever had. 

So I don't really know how to find a guy that could like me, the place I live is very open about it, in the UK, just to clarify so there is no real religious bs overtones. Almost everyday I see couples of dudes with dudes and gals with gals holding hands in public, so I know it's possible.

There may be the classic answer of 'someone for everyone' that will come to this but every gay guy I've met it's like they are trying waaaaay too hard to be feminine and gay. I'd like to meet more but I'm also stuck in not being able to go to gay bars now, having nothing but straight guy-friends and no real girls to accompany me, plus even more horror stories of those people that give sexual diseases on purpose just makes me almost not want to be gay.

It almost baffles me that, from what I took from 15 or so gay guys chatting that day, that being known for sleeping around with a bunch of guys is a good thing, it makes you queen of the gays! Again I'm not sure if I'm being terribly offensive to the community but from what I've seen, It's like I'm still straight. What's the point in even coming out as gay if I can't even be good at being gay?

I don't recall where I heard it from, but there was this story about a Gay World where straight children had the task of feeling afraid and coming out. I don't think that's even remotely close to the Opposite.

Those that have an issue with their children or someone being gay it's mainly religious. So in order for the stiuation to be in reverse it would have to be the following:

Imagine you are married to the love of your life. You have a great ceremony and are accepted in the community you live in with open arms. Same with each other's family. No issues. Everything is working out great. No bumps. 

You adopt a baby. He grows up and loves you both. You teach him to be tolerant and accepting and are proud of his every accomplishment his had. Of course he's made mistakes, but as proud parents you can gloss over those. He hasn't come out to you as being gay and so you assume he's going to bring home a girl any moment when he enter's high school.

Instead of coming home with a girl, he comes home with an idea. The idea that he is going to join a religion and this religion isn't too keen on homosexuality. He knows that. And he still wants to be a part of the religion. 

You and your husband offer your advice as calmly and lovingly as possible and know that he will do the right thing. Because you raised him to think. 

Instead he decides to join the religion. 

The question is, how would you deal with something like that? What would you say? How would you react? 

I'm asking with all seriousness. It may be a situation that won't ever happen, but to me this is the exact opposite of what someone who is religious would deal with. It's an ideology.

Firstly, I'd just like to thank all of you who commented and gave me advice on the previous post, and because the post got so much attention I thought it wouldn't be fair for me not to make an update. 

As many comments suggested that I do, is to slightly hint toward the notion that I am perfectly happy with having a gay son, while letting him do the work in actually saying the words ""I'm gay"", and I thought that was a very good idea. 

I started off with talking about general media with him, for instance I mentioned how awesome it was that Tim Cook (CEO of Apple) came out as being gay and I asked him what he thought about it and I was completely expecting him to give a typical teenager response like ""yeah.. its good"" or something like that but he actually gave me a detailed response which I absolutely loved because for the first time in a good while I've actually held a conversation with my son that felt really... rewarding. 

I also wanted to talk to him about how I've noticed that he's not been acting as cheerful as he usually has and I sort of gave the cliche spiel of ""I love you no matter what and I just want to see you be happy"" but I didn't get much of a response that time apart from ""yeah I know..""

The next day as I picked him up from school I thought I'd ask him about any crushes he has, and I wanted to make sure I didn't say a gender when I asked him, so instead of 'he' or 'she' I used 'they' etc..
Here is that conversation as I remember it...

Me: So, do you have a crush on anyone?

Son: Uhm... no..m..maybe..

Me: Ohhh so who is the lucky person? 

At this point he sort of looked at me slightly confused, I'm not 100% sure why, but I'm assuming it is because I said ""lucky person"" rather than ""lucky girl"".

Son: Just someone from my french class...

Me: Oh yeah... so what do you like about them?

Son: Just.. stuff..

Me: Okay.. but.. like what?

Son: I donno they're just kinda funny I guess...

At this point I dropped the conversation but just before I did I told him ""Well, whoever it is, they should be so lucky to have you as a boyfriend.."" and while I didn't see it, I certainly felt as though he was rolling his eyes at my cheesy comments. 

At the dinner table the same day, while we were eating we had a couple minutes of silence, not much was heard apart from the cutlery and my son finally said ""I actually wanted to tell you something in the car, but I was afraid you'd get in an accident.."" I looked up from my plate and looked at him straight in the eyes... I could see he was thinking about something and all I could think of was ""OMG this is it..."" he said ""Dad.."" with a couple seconds of silence ""..I'm gay"". I looked at him and couldn't help myself from smiling, and I told him ""____, you know I love you so much... right?"" and I got up and gave him a huge hug. He even started to cry on my shoulder and because of that I couldn't help myself but shed a couple tears. We talked for a bit while finishing our dinner about how I can't emphasize enough that I love him regardless of which gender he loves etc...

After dinner and after he finished his homework we both lay in our pajamas on the sofa, while I was watching the Cooking Channel and he was playing on his iPad. I had my arm around him and he was leaning his head on my chest, and all I could think of was that I'm the happiest father on earth right now.

Thank you all so much for your feedback and suggestions on the last post. All of you are so kind on this subreddit, so many of you sent me PM's explaining how I was a super dad and it honestly brightened my day. 

For those curious as to what I will be doing next, I've already started doing some research in LGBT Youth Communities and I think joining one would be a perfect start to helping my son develop into the person he has the potential to being. 

Thank you all again...

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I&amp;#39;d just like to thank all of you who commented and gave me advice on the previous post, and because the post got so much attention I thought it wouldn&amp;#39;t be fair for me not to make an update. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As many comments suggested that I do, is to slightly hint toward the notion that I am perfectly happy with having a gay son, while letting him do the work in actually saying the words &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m gay&amp;quot;, and I thought that was a very good idea. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started off with talking about general media with him, for instance I mentioned how awesome it was that Tim Cook (CEO of Apple) came out as being gay and I asked him what he thought about it and I was completely expecting him to give a typical teenager response like &amp;quot;yeah.. its good&amp;quot; or something like that but he actually gave me a detailed response which I absolutely loved because for the first time in a good while I&amp;#39;ve actually held a conversation with my son that felt really... rewarding. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also wanted to talk to him about how I&amp;#39;ve noticed that he&amp;#39;s not been acting as cheerful as he usually has and I sort of gave the cliche spiel of &amp;quot;I love you no matter what and I just want to see you be happy&amp;quot; but I didn&amp;#39;t get much of a response that time apart from &amp;quot;yeah I know..&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day as I picked him up from school I thought I&amp;#39;d ask him about any crushes he has, and I wanted to make sure I didn&amp;#39;t say a gender when I asked him, so instead of &amp;#39;he&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;she&amp;#39; I used &amp;#39;they&amp;#39; etc..

I’m feeling really conflicted about my relationship. It’s my first relationship with a guy and we’ve been together for 6 months. I’m 19 and left my part-time job to become a full-time student at community college. He’s 26, a great guy, but currently unemployed for about 5 months. My problem is that I’m having second thoughts about my relationship right now. I’m feeling like I need to take some time being single and knowing what I want, what makes me happy, working on myself, etc. On the other side, my boyfriend is good catch. He’s caring, enjoys any and every moment we spend together, and there might be a good future with him. If I break up with him, I know I would be losing someone that I feel happy with.

He loves me more than I love him; I probably don’t even have anything near the feelings he does. Last month he gave me copies of keys to his place, his car, his email account (all things I didn’t expect and feel awkward having), he drastically fixed up his place (though he said he couldn’t unless I came out to my parents), and he’s quit smoking. About 2-3 months into the relationship, he asked when I wanted to move in with him. At the time I said no because I don’t think I’m ready to move in with someone when I haven’t had a roommate yet. Last weekend, he’s been wanting me to stay at his place every night (at this point, I’ve been spending most of my weekends there for about a month or two). I’ve also talked about this with my parents. We agreed that I could spend an additional night in the middle of the week. The reason why is because I currently travel to 4 different places: home, my boyfriend’s, and 2 school campuses (one that’s close by and one that’s about 10 miles away). I gave both my boyfriend and my parents this reason and all of us agree on it. He lives less than 5 miles away from me, so it’s not that far, but it would’ve been a hassle to travel between 3-4 places about 5-6 days a week. I also plan on transferring to a university in one year, one of which will require me to move because it’s in a different part of the state.

I also know that his unemployment is a little bit of an issue although it probably shouldn’t matter. Both of us live in a big metropolitan city, so jobs are plentiful here. But it’s been 5 months since he’s been unemployed. He did work at a gas station before, but he got let go. I’ve been supportive of him trying to land a new job. So far it’s just been a few interviews that he’s told me about. I helped him with his resume before and I told him of any places that I saw had a hiring sign. Sometimes he says he fills out 10-20 applications in a day. So while he’s out of a job, I do pay a little bit more often. I’ve paid for a couple of dinners, though nothing too fancy, drinks at the corner store, gas once or twice, and a couple of other small purchases (like a ticket for the state fair). I’m also usually the one to drive to his place on the weekend (I also drive to the school on the weekend by the way). He’s also paid for dinner in the past, few drinks here and there, and some things like a candy or popcorn. He also gets a few groceries on the side for himself. I don’t mind paying, but I also have school and gas to pay for too. He knows this so he’s told me that if I don’t want to pay for something beforehand, I don’t have to. I’m probably making the financial stuff more of a bigger problem than it is.

Overall, I’m 19 and some people have said it’s ok to not know what I want or take the time to know myself first, but that’s probably selfish of me to break up with because of that. Even my boyfriend has said he thought about breaking up with me because of that even though I haven’t told him about this. I just know that it’ll really suck because he’s ready to keep a serious relationship and settle down in a few years. If I do break up with my boyfriend, he’s going to be extremely heartbroken and I might regret the decision because I lost someone special. I know I should tell him what I’ve been feeling recently. I’m just kind of all over the place right now.

Tl;dr: Torn between breaking up with my boyfriend and know myself first before dating again, or staying in a relationship that could get better over time with a good guy.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys,&lt;/p&gt;
