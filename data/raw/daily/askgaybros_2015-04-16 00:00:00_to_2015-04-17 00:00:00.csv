Posting update here in case anyone cares to read...

[First post](http://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/324fu5/i_was_a_gay_porn_actor_many_years_ago_gay_guys/)

I did what some people suggested in my last thread, and tried to get a feel for how he felt about sex, promiscuity, and porn actors in general. I already knew he was on the more conservative side when it comes to sex, but this confirmed it. At one point I even asked (casually, like a hypothetical question): “Would you ever date a porn actor?” He didn’t hesitate to say, “I don’t think so.”

I reconsidered telling him at all. I’ve been falling hard now, and it felt unfair that what I did 7 yrs ago gets to end two previous relationships and jeopardize this one too.

But he’s a good kid and I felt like he deserved to know what he was getting into. It wasn’t fair for me to hold all the cards. So now, I wasn’t debating “if” I should tell him, but “when” I would, and consequently lose him. I was counting down the days I had left with him.

It’s been just about 3 months now and the furthest we’ve gone was me giving him oral. The sex thing came up again and he wanted to know exactly why I was putting off sex.

So I told him everything, with context of what had led up to it so that he’d understand that I didn’t do porn for fun or in some youthful YOLO phase. I also told him that porn was in no way like real sex and that I didn’t expect anything of him, that he could set the pace in our sex life and that I was dead serious about our relationship.

I answered every question he had, including my porn alias, details about what I’d done, STDs (I had my test results to show him), etc.

He was definitely shaken but assured me he just needed some time to get used to the idea, and that we were by no means over. I had been mentally preparing myself this whole time to get dumped on the spot, so I was pretty floored.

The next few days he had exams for school coming up so we didn’t see each other much. We texted a bit but he didn’t bring it up again. He seemed affectionate, so I thought maybe this one was actually going to work out. I couldn’t believe my luck, and felt relieved that this was out in the open and he was giving me a shot anyways.

Then he called me over. I could tell that he’d been crying. He apologized and said he’d looked up my porn. I had asked him not to, but I guess he couldn’t handle not knowing. He said that I was a good guy, but he wasn’t cool with having my body out all over the internet, that he was looking for a serious relationship and he just couldn’t handle living with *that* his entire life, not to mention I was well known enough that it seemed inevitable at some point other people would find out.

I was pretty stoic throughout all this, so I said ok, acted like it was no big deal, and left. I couldn’t stop wondering which videos he’d watched. Out of some masochistic impulse I went online and watched some of my old videos for the first time in years. Yeah. Still as ugly as I remembered them to be. It was worse than I thought too, because some of the more extreme niche type videos had been pirated and were showing up on mainstream free sites. I can’t imagine what he must have thought when he was watching them.

So I’m back where I started, except feeling a lot shittier this time. I’m angry but mostly just depressed, because if I’d known this would be my life 10+ years down the road I would have just slept under a bridge back then or something.

I called up my old therapist who counseled me for PTSD and BDD after I left the industry. I have an appointment next week. That was another punch in the gut. Last time we met, she and I had both been pretty proud of where I am now, and now I have to go back. I’m pretty fucking ashamed that one breakup after a 3month relationship has brought me down this low. But it had been 4 years of singlehood before him, time spent on improving myself and getting over the last bf, and I (foolishly) put too many eggs in this new basket. I used to think I had my mental issues beat, but this latest incident has me doubting all the progress I thought I’d made.

Please don’t rag on this guy. I still care about him and can’t handle hearing right now that “he was a scumbag/didn’t deserve you/etc” because he really wasn’t a shitty guy. He wasn’t heartless or cruel when he ended it. He was a perfectly sweet kid who couldn’t handle the news that his bf was a porn actor. I don’t fault him for it. I’m good looking, and that’s about it, whereas he was gorgeous on top of being smart, classy, and going places in life. He was out of my league.

Fuck everything.

Here's my problem: I don't know a single openly gay person. All 3 of the gay guys at school have absolutely nothing in common with me, and I have no clue where else to look. I always hoped that I would be able to have at least my first kiss before I was 18, but that dream has already come and gone. I'm slightly overweight, so hookup sites have been useless. I started to lose a decent amount of weight, but I've become so lonely and discouraged that I haven't been able to get myself to the gym anymore, so I've started gaining it back. 
All that I was is some sort of in-person interaction with another gay man, platonically, romantically, or even just sexually.

I've considered going to a gay club (probably Rage in WeHo since it's like an hour from where I live, and the only 18+ gay club in LA from what I hear), going to a bathhouse pretty much out of sheer desperation, or even basically hiring a escort for a night, although I wouldn't do that since I know that I'd grow too attached to him. I'm just scared that if I go to a gay bar or a bathhouse, I'll get rejected repeatedly, and I don't know if my self-esteem could handle that.

Sorry but I'm not really sure who to talk to about this so I figured since I spend so much time on reddit, there has to be a place to seek some guidance on this part of my life too... 

I'm a little unsure of my sexuality. I guess I always have been, but it's been at the forefront of my mind quite a lot lately and really need to just write it down. Not sure if I'll hit submit or not yet. I'll give a brief rundown of my sexual history for context.

I was sexual from a pretty young age. When I was 3/4 my brother's friend (ten-ish years my senior) molested me. Whatever, I've come to grips with it and don't focus on that.

I remember several times between the age of 3 and about 10 where I was doing things with other kids my age. Show and tell with girls, mutual masturbation with a boy, clothed humping with my step-sister.

By the time I was 13 I pretty much felt for sure that I was gay. I had a male friend my age that we started mutual masturbation. Which turned into masturbating each other, then eventually oral and kissing. I fell in love with him. He was my first love. All the sappy poetry and love letters and kissing in secret. All that typical puppy love stuff. He ended up getting a girlfriend but we still did a lot of that stuff anyway. It wasn't until we were about 17 that we went our separate ways.

At which point I started chasing after girls. I was involved with music, which made that pretty easy over the next 7ish years I bedded a total of 7 girls, having relationships with 2. In hindsight, my last girlfriend especially was very tomboyish. Short hair, boyish attitude, small breasts, etc. I've always been attracted to tomboy's I guess. Never really the girly-girls.

A couple of years ago I met a lesbian couple, and we became friends pretty quickly. To the point where we were completely enveloped in each others lives every single day (A best friends/siblings type deal nothing more), and they opened up the world of homosexuality to me again. I met a lot of gay and lesbian people through them. I often had people confuse me as gay myself because I was always with them (which I often got irrationally upset at, not really sure why).

I've found myself being attracted to other guys but never really thinking on it too much. I do read a few Adult Friends stories on Nifty occasionally (I know, I know... it's a shady site). It's always the love stories that hook me in.

Anyway, for the past couple of years I've had a few women make advances on me and I've always made a point not to take very obvious opportunities and I never really understood why. I've always known I was at least a little attracted to men still but for the past ten years, in my mind... I've been straight.

But now... I'm not so sure. And I don't feel like I can talk to my lesbian friend because, as much as she's an amazing person, she can't keep a secret to save her life.

A question. Is it normal to be attracted to men, to find being romantic, kissing, oral sex, all that stuff like an attractive idea but find anal sex repulsive (sorry if that offends anyone)?

I haven't really let my thoughts out as clearly and concisely as I was hoping so I apologise if this is just a babbling mess, but I just wanted to write it out.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey there.

I often had people confuse me as gay myself because I was always with them (which I often got irrationally upset at, not really sure why).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve found myself being attracted to other guys but never really thinking on it too much. I do read a few Adult Friends stories on Nifty occasionally (I know, I know... it&amp;#39;s a shady site). It&amp;#39;s always the love stories that hook me in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, for the past couple of years I&amp;#39;ve had a few women make advances on me and I&amp;#39;ve always made a point not to take very obvious opportunities and I never really understood why. I&amp;#39;ve always known I was at least a little attracted to men still but for the past ten years, in my mind... I&amp;#39;ve been straight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now... I&amp;#39;m not so sure. And I don&amp;#39;t feel like I can talk to my lesbian friend because, as much as she&amp;#39;s an amazing person, she can&amp;#39;t keep a secret to save her life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A question. Is it normal to be attracted to men, to find being romantic, kissing, oral sex, all that stuff like an attractive idea but find anal sex repulsive (sorry if that offends anyone)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t really let my thoughts out as clearly and concisely as I was hoping so I apologise if this is just a babbling mess, but I just wanted to write it out.&lt;/p&gt;

I've graduated from college with a degree in Film and Television Production, but I moved back home after school for a variety of reasons, the main two being that I was broke and couldn't afford to move anywhere where jobs in my field were, and because my mother has Multiple Schlerosis and she needed some help since my sister is wildly rebellious and doesn't help out. 

As of now, I've been home for a year and a half and I'm kind of stuck about what to do. I'm looking to be a video editor, eventually maybe for movies and TV. Most of the jobs in this field are in Atlanta and LA, but both are far away and a little expensive. Right now I have a minimum wage job and I'm helping out with bills, with a second job starting in a few weeks. I've calculated my expenses and if I save up for the next three months, sell my TV and some other valuables, and use the rest of my tax money that I have, I can move out to LA with about 5 thousand to see about finding a job. 

My concern with this is that it takes awhile to find jobs out there, and it's an expensive lifestyle. I've had friends who were out there six months or more before they found a job after graduation, and I can't afford to live that long out there. If I go and don't find anything, it means that I'm going to have to move back home, be out of three months of saving and hard work, having to find new jobs, and will be out of five thousand dollars. 

I could also go to graduate school for my master's degree in film editing, which I would like to do because I'd love to have a Master's degree. I owe the school a few grand from online classes I had to drop out of last year due to the fact I was working so much, but I could easily pay that back. If I apply for spring semester, I'd have time to pay them back, save up money, and go down there to San Francisco for school. I'd also be in dorms, meaning that any job that I would find there would be extra money that I'd save. 

Going to school, I could graduate with my master's, make new connections and friends, have a nice nest egg saved up, and have a lot more experience under my belt. However, that's another three years of school.

So, I need advice. I've been thinking in circles around all of this and I'm flip flopping more than the footwear of the same name. Any advice that you guys have, or pointers? I could use anything you have at this point. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;#39;m a 22yo trying to figure out what the hell to do with my life.

We'll call him Mark. We hit it off great, and I flirt with him over several days. I move slowly and I don't have much dating experience, so it takes me five days to work up the courage to ask to meet.

He accepts and we figure out the details and exchange information and then he says, ""Just to be clear, you wanted to hang out as friends, right?"" I'm thoroughly confused, and go back to his profile to see that he had updated it to say he was in a relationship. That should've been the first red flag to walk away.

I take the meeting anyway since we had already confirmed schedules and I figured oh well, it can't hurt to make a new friend. So I meet him and he's even more amazing in person. Cute, funny, sexy as hell, and he has the same lame dad joke sense of humor I do.

I find out that during that five day period fun when I first met him online to when I and him out, he ex asked him to get back together. Let's call him Jake. I also learn that none of his friends like Jake and that Jake had cheated on him twice in the past. Apparently, Jake wasn't looking for a serious relationship back then, but now he's looking to settle down. This should've been the second red flag.

Mark and I grow close over the following weeks. We're hanging out a lot and text everyday. I can tell he's not happy, but he had decided to give Jake two months. A few weeks into our friendship, I get a series of drunk texts from Mark, basically admitting that he's really into me and wished he had met me sooner. A couple weeks later, we're hanging out at his house and end up making out all night. The next day he's remorseful and full of regret. We decide it was a mistake and it shouldn't happen again and we should just be friends. That should've been the third red flag to walk away from the situation.

I wish I had asked him to give me a shot. I wanted to be his boyfriend, I believed he was with the wrong guy, and he should be with me. And a week later, when I realized all this, Jake's sister is hospitalized. Two weeks later, she passes away. I can't do anything. What kind of douche asks a guy to leave his boyfriend when the guy's sister just died?

Time passes and I continue to talk to Mark everyday. I realize that the platonic friend thing is not working for me and I'm beginning to develop some really strong feelings. I think about him constantly, I plan my schedule around times when I could possibly see him. At one point Mark catches Jake texting with the guy he had cheated on him with in the past, but he didn't say anything because of the whole situation with the sister. He tells me though.

A few weeks ago, we went to a drive-in movie on a Tuesday. It's a double feature, but we have no interest in the second film, so we lay there in the back of his SUV and talk about our lives. Cuddling leads to making out.

When he drops me off at home, he kisses me goodbye. He's not remorseful this time. I invite him to come over on Friday night. We watch movies and end up hooking up. When I drop him off at the train the next day, he kisses me goodbye and asks when he can see me again.

Last weekend he went on a road trip. He had to be somewhere and was supposed to go with his best friend, but the guy got food poisoning, so he asked me. I thought that maybe during this trip I'll finally ask him to leave his boyfriend. Instead, on Saturday night I get drunk at the club we're at and I try to make out with him and I get rejected.

I feel like a total idiot. He doesn't want me, he wants Jake. It's been three months and he's still with the guy, so what the hell am I doing?

Tonight I'm meeting up with him to end things. I don't know if I'm ready for this. He's become a fixture in my life. I talk to him everyday and see him at least once a week if not more. I wrote him a letter. I plan to read it aloud to him, explaining where I'm at and how I feel. I want so badly to remain in his life and I don't know how am going to handle losing this relationship, but if I keep doing what I've been doing, I think I'm going to destroy myself.

Edit: Thank you for all the replies and encouragement. This has been a really difficult decision that I've known I'd have to make for a couple weeks now. To be clear, I don't think he's a bad guy, he's actually an incredibly kind and compassionate person who's made some mistakes. And I am just as complicit in this whole situation too. As some of you have pointed out though, even if I he did leave his boyfriend for me, how would I be able to trust him. So I need to just step aside and let that relationship run its course.

I started in fall of 2014. I have a math class with this guy from last semester, while we didn't talk last semester at all, he came and sat beside me this semester like we were best friends. He has asked for help in a few of his other classes, which I have given him seeing as I had the same teachers last semester. It is time to register for fall classes and we are taking the same math class next semester, but were in different periods. He asked me to change my schedule so we could be in the same class again. This guy is like 18 or 19, really cute and all. He makes suttle gestures all the time I  class, and little brushes against my legs with his. I'm not sure if he's gay or not, but I'm scared to come right out and ask him because I enjoy talking to him. I don't want to lose what could be a good friend just because I'm reading signs wrong. Any advice?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;m 31 and recently back in college.  I started in fall of 2014. I have a math class with this guy from last semester, while we didn&amp;#39;t talk last semester at all, he came and sat beside me this semester like we were best friends. He has asked for help in a few of his other classes, which I have given him seeing as I had the same teachers last semester. It is time to register for fall classes and we are taking the same math class next semester, but were in different periods. He asked me to change my schedule so we could be in the same class again.

I still try to meet new people and date but if it came down to be single, I personally wouldn't mind it.
