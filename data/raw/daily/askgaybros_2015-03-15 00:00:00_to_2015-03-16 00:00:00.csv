So over 4 months ago my partner of pretty much 10 years left me for a woman, it was an awful and hellish experience that was extremely difficult for me to get over; probably not even actually over it but I can't tell.  I suffer from depression and anxiety now, currently taking prozac and klonopin.  And I am extremely lonely.

I live alone, I'm supposed to move in with 2 of my best friends at the end of this month but not sure if that will work out because I need to sublet my current apartment as I can't afford the lease anymore but I haven't taken the steps I need to to get the ball rolling.  I don't know what my problem is, I'm back in University working on a teaching degree, I'm almost finished but I'm suffering from the same stuff I have for years, lack of motivation and doing the minimum to get by.  My apartment is messy, I haven't started packing yet, I can't seem to control my diet, I've been drinking almost every single night, I haven't been working much and paying my bills on time.  I don't know what's wrong with me, I'm in this lazy depressed sad funk and I can't get out, even with medication and talking.

I'm trying to better myself by going to the gym regular and I definitely see results but I can't control my diet and I eat out all the time because I'm too lazy to cook so the results are very slow.  I don't think I'm ugly but I need to lose weight and gain some confidence.  I've signed up for 3 smartphone apps, Grindr, Scruff, and Growlr.  I've had a couple dates and a couple hook ups but it's been pretty awful so far, I only get ever get men I'm not attracted to, I'm nice to everyone and always try to reply and at least have a small conversation to see if there's any spark but there never is really...  The only guy I have been sort of interested in is HIV+ and technically homeless, I feel for him and we have so much in common, I thought we hit it off and we could help each other but he hasn't talked to me in days and even though he told me that he thinks I'm very handsome and that he really wants to hang out again I haven't heard from him at all.  Feels awful being rejected by the single person I have been interested in since my relationship ended.  I am a top so it seems easier to find random sex, but the couple of guys I've been intimate with I have not been attracted to at all and I just did it because I felt lonely and because I made out with them and led them on I felt like I had to... Also I don't know if it's because of my medication or because I'm not attracted to them or my body image is shit or what but I can't seem to cum for them, I get hard but I lose that frequently, but it's weird I can jerk off to porn and cum no problem. I feel so pathetic.

Sorry for the long jumbled post but I just need people to talk to and maybe get some advice and understanding, hopefully I'll hear from someone soon.  I can give more details also here's my Instagram link so you can see what I look like.

edit: Deleted Instagram link for being hideous! I realize now that my post was whiny and embarrassing, I need to man up, thanks to those that replied, I'm going to try to have a good life.

I mostly played Runescape, but sometimes WoW. It was initially casual without much thought, but then around 2011 I started playing competitively. I aimed for max levels and basically adopted a completionist/competitive attitude which I never had before.

Before 2010 my grades were straight A's and I was doing really well so I didn't think much of my gaming. I got into a top university in 2011 but my grades suffered - I was mainly getting lower Second-class (50-60%) which is seen as bad. You are expected to get a First or upper Second, and many jobs/grad schemes/etc require this. I graduated with a 2.2 and was relieved because I actually thought I would fail. Normally I think what happens to most students:

* Start uni, find it hard

* Work harder = improve grades = feels like an achievement

* Reinforces the ""I can do this! I can do well!"" attitude

For me, video game achievements replaced the second step so I never wanted to study harder. I went from a top student to one of the worst. It seems like I was getting my ""achievement"" or ""improving"" fix from games instead of my studies. The games also had many daily or holiday activities, and I felt like I ""missed out"" if I didn't do these.

Anyway I'm hoping to start a Masters in September but I don't want to fuck up again. I realise that all the time spent playing on these MMOs aren't helping me at all - I could spend this time doing something else more productive, something else that will **actually** benefit my life. I need to get back to real life achievements basically.

I don't play a lot of non-MMOs, mostly Elder Scrolls/Dragon Age/Final Fantasy which are all offline and I can play at my own pace, so I'm pretty ok with games like that. They don't come out too often as well. It's just going to be hard letting go of all my invested MMO hours, but it's better to cut the cord now than in 10 years.

Out of the few times I've had sex I've only topped once, and that was only because the guy really wanted me to and I figured why not. Unlike bottoming I had no clue what I was doing and it didn't feel natural. A while later I was asked by a different dude to top, and I said no since I thought I wouldn't find it enjoyable. Both times were after oral or me bottoming.

For the last few years I haven't really had any friends, and I decided at the beginning of this year to make it a goal to to get over my social anxiety issues and start to build a bit of a social circle.  It's actually been going pretty great!  I started going to some meetup groups and met some really cool people.  

Today I went to this shyness group that I usually go to on Saturdays and afterwards one of the guys I met there a few weeks ago (Nathan) and another new guy who came to the group this week (Andrew) went to a restaurant.  It was really fun and there was a lot of good conversation!  The problem is they don't know I'm gay and I felt completely out of place when they started talking about how to get into a relationship with a girl.  

As a side-note, a few weeks ago when I met Nathan we went to a restaurant with another girl from the group (Donna).  Donna and I had so much in common and I've rarely had conversation with anyone that flowed that freely.  We basically talked for 3 hours nonstop!  I went home at the end of the night thinking, ""Man, if she was a gay guy, she'd be perfect for me"" haha.  

So today when Nathan and Andrew were talking about girls and I was pretty much completely silent, Nathan said to me, ""Would you be interested in getting to know Donna better?  From the other week, it seems like she'd be a perfect fit for you!""  I kind of froze and didn't really know what to say so I just made some excuse to change the topic.  

Anyway, it seems like these people are starting to become closer to me (I even invited them to my apartment after the restaurant) and I'd like to be able to be my whole self with them.  But I'm not sure when would be the right time to come out to them, and how I should come out to them.  I've never really had much experience coming out to people since I was a social recluse for years.  It's really exciting to have new friends, but at the same time the awkwardness around not completely being myself and feeling out of place in conversations regarding relationships is really bothering me.

I'm 26, I may stay in NY a little longer but I'm considering moving somewhere in a bit. I live in suburbs currently but find NYC a little hectic to live in so I'm not sure if I would want to move there. Also after 26 years a change of scenery seems like it could be nice.

Anyway considerations - nice scenery, affordable apartments/housing, a sizeable amountoif gay people (that aren't too uptight) so there's good odds of making new friends.

I was really thinking about Cali but have heard housing is expensive and for self employed people they also have high taxes so I'm not so sure about it.

Any ideas appreciated.

Hey guys, I have a slight dilemma that i would appreciate your input/advice on. To avoid a wall of text ill just give you the pertinent information.
 Met a guy a while back, talked for quite a while and we had a great connection. Went on a date and things went well (from what i assumed). After the date we still talked for a while. We talked about meeting up again for a second date. Ended up not working out for reasons i will explain. We lost touch for a bit and out of the blue he starts talking to me again. I had originally assumed he wasn't interested anymore due to him completely not responding. which is understandable if he wasnt feeling it. His text to me was apologizing for everything. He is still in the closet and i may have freaked him out a bit (on that date (and no i wasnt being crazy i swear haha)). I dont think he is fully comfortable with himself yet. To each their own. Dealing with someone still in the closet is a new thing for me.
Question time: He proposed a fwb situation. Never been in one myself (not a hookup kind of guy) and am worried that i may develope feelings for him again. The frustrating thing is i know he wants a relationship too, but is just not in that place yet (I can only assume). 
I usually can answer these personal questions for myself but hearing an outsider opinion would probably pull things into perspective. Especially since i know i want to but dont know if i should.
Fwb? no Fwb? or any advice would be great. I will of course talk to him about this, but id like to hear other peoples opinions before i potentially dive into something disastorous (or great).

Quick read: 22 y.o. accepted marriage proposal from 40 y.o. BF. Parents unexpectedly did NOT freak out!

OK, so I told my parents everything. I was stammering and trying not to cry as I told them that I had been living with my guy for 2 years. They said that while they were still uncomfortable with the relationship, I was a man now (first time my father ever used the word ""man"" to describe me) and they had already assumed for some time that I had moved in with him given that he lives so close to my campus. I told them there was more... and then I revealed that he proposed and I accepted. They were quiet for what seemed like forever. My father finally broke the silence and said that he and my mother would need to speak now, without me in the room. I immediately ran up to my old room and collapsed sobbing on the bed, not quite sure why I was crying. I must have made quite a spectacle of myself b/c my brothers (18 y.o. identical twins) came racing in. I finally pulled it together enough to tell them that I was engaged and just told mom &amp; dad. They love my guy and actually started whooping and high-fiving. Finally one of them asked ""Wait, what did they say? Are they pissed?"" I replied that they didn't say anything and were downstairs talking. My brothers were quiet. I started crying again and asked them to leave me by myself. Instead they sat on either side of me on the bed and said there was no way that they were leaving me. One of them added, ""Ever."" That really got me crying hysterically. After another eternity I heard my father calling for me. I got up and my brothers sprang up too and were right behind me. We went back to living room and I sat down in front of my parents. My brothers were standing on either side of me. It was clear that both of my parents had been crying. My father asked my brothers to leave the room. They moved even closer to me. One of them looked down at me and said calmly, ""He decides if we stay or go."" I was able to squeak out the word ""stay,"" and then my father spoke again. He said that this news was certainly a shock to them. He asked me to look him in the eye, and he asked me if I was sure that this was what I wanted to do. I looked him in the eyes and managed to whisper ""More than anything."" He responded in that case, he and my mother would make it their goal to accept it. He said that it would definitely take a while, but he promised that full acceptance would be the eventual outcome. It took everything I had to hold it together. I was shaking. It helped that at this point each brother had a hand on my shoulder and that helped me stay upright. And then my dad had to go and request that I find out when my fiancé could come over for dinner so that they could ""formally welcome our new son-in-law into the family."" And I fucking lost it! My brothers told my parents that they would take things from there, and I think my parents were probably relieved to be able to get away from my wailing. I also think I cried harder than I had after accepting my fiancé's  proposal, if that makes any sense. My brothers sat down and hugged me until I finally calmed down and then made sure that I got upstairs so that I could clean up. They then dropped me off at the house so I could tell my guy the news. Needless to say, he was relieved about the outcome. Thanks for all the replies everybody! Even the few negative ones were helpful to my thought process... and also bolstered me in knowing that my decision was the right one!

This is a long story and need advice from your redditors. 5 years ago, I met this guy on my freshmen floor in the dorms who we will call Andy. Andy and I became friends pretty quick and gotten pretty close as time progress. When I told him I was gay he took it really well and was very supportive and understanding. The dynamic of our relationship didn't change and we always chilled with each other. It wasn't until junior year, he drunkenly kissed me and we ended up sleeping with each other. The next morning, we woke up and he said he just wanted to experiment and didn't want to continue which I was fine about, but then after that incident we drunkenly text each other and fooled around. He was in the closet and didn't want to come out, he kept saying he liked girls and wanted to have a wife and kids later in life. Yeah I was heartbroken because I actually fell for the dude but I couldn't say anything because I knew this coming in. It was until he got jealous that I hooked up with another dude at a party did he text me saying he was angry and he wanted to talk. He said he was jealous and didn't want me fooling around which I also said I didn't want him because other girls too. We agreed to only see each other and no one else until we graduated. He did take me on dates and sporting events because we both are huge hockey fans. Eventually he graduates and moves home and I stay near the university because I found a job as a mechanical engineer. We said our peace and promised to always be friends. We text each other back and forth every other day, who we're dating and what we are up to. He recently broke up with his girlfriend of six months and drunk texted me yesterday saying the reason he broke up with her was because he was still into me, but doesn't know how to handle it. As much as I like him, I can't see myself with him because he occasionally mentions he needs a girl in his life and a wife and kids and I don't want to set myself up for heartache. I've seen him talk to girls and he keeps saying I'm the only dude he is into. I just think its unhealthy and don't want to waste my time. Now, we've been talking all day about moving in together because my job is relocating close to my hometown and getting 2 dogs and 1 cat in our one bedroom apartment. I just don't want to invest in this relationship anymore because I feel like he'll make the decision one day to not continue and want the wife and kids life. 

TL:DR - best friends with one of my bros, fooled around for several years. Got jealous when we flirted and slept with other people. Decided to only mess around with each other until we graduated college. Got a drunk text from him saying he has feelings for me. Now I might be relocated back to my hometown (and he only lives 1 hour from my hometown) and he wants to move in together but I fear one day he'll be back to the ""straight"" side.

&lt;p&gt;This is a long story and need advice from your redditors. 5 years ago, I met this guy on my freshmen floor in the dorms who we will call Andy. Andy and I became friends pretty quick and gotten pretty close as time progress. When I told him I was gay he took it really well and was very supportive and understanding. The dynamic of our relationship didn&amp;#39;t change and we always chilled with each other. It wasn&amp;#39;t until junior year, he drunkenly kissed me and we ended up sleeping with each other. The next morning, we woke up and he said he just wanted to experiment and didn&amp;#39;t want to continue which I was fine about, but then after that incident we drunkenly text each other and fooled around. He was in the closet and didn&amp;#39;t want to come out, he kept saying he liked girls and wanted to have a wife and kids later in life. Yeah I was heartbroken because I actually fell for the dude but I couldn&amp;#39;t say anything because I knew this coming in. It was until he got jealous that I hooked up with another dude at a party did he text me saying he was angry and he wanted to talk. He said he was jealous and didn&amp;#39;t want me fooling around which I also said I didn&amp;#39;t want him because other girls too. We agreed to only see each other and no one else until we graduated. He did take me on dates and sporting events because we both are huge hockey fans. Eventually he graduates and moves home and I stay near the university because I found a job as a mechanical engineer. We said our peace and promised to always be friends. We text each other back and forth every other day, who we&amp;#39;re dating and what we are up to. He recently broke up with his girlfriend of six months and drunk texted me yesterday saying the reason he broke up with her was because he was still into me, but doesn&amp;#39;t know how to handle it. As much as I like him, I can&amp;#39;t see myself with him because he occasionally mentions he needs a girl in his life and a wife and kids and I don&amp;#39;t want to set myself up for heartache. I&amp;#39;ve seen him talk to girls and he keeps saying I&amp;#39;m the only dude he is into. I just think its unhealthy and don&amp;#39;t want to waste my time. Now, we&amp;#39;ve been talking all day about moving in together because my job is relocating close to my hometown and getting 2 dogs and 1 cat in our one bedroom apartment. I just don&amp;#39;t want to invest in this relationship anymore because I feel like he&amp;#39;ll make the decision one day to not continue and want the wife and kids life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL:DR - best friends with one of my bros, fooled around for several years. Got jealous when we flirted and slept with other people. Decided to only mess around with each other until we graduated college. Got a drunk text from him saying he has feelings for me. Now I might be relocated back to my hometown (and he only lives 1 hour from my hometown) and he wants to move in together but I fear one day he&amp;#39;ll be back to the &amp;quot;straight&amp;quot; side.&lt;/p&gt;

Also, this is a problem that has a few layers that I'm not comfortable sharing with friends. [So last time, I posted about how I'm seeing this older guy who is HIV+ and the consensus was just use PrEP and condoms.](http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/2xj26s/guy_im_kind_of_seeing_is_hiv_i_really_like_him/) Sounds easy enough, but I wouldn't accept that I looked down on people who use PrEP, but I got over it. Many of you pointed out that it was problematic that he waited until I explicitly asked (and in a compromising position) and I didn't really think much of it, but you guys made a really good point. In any case, I decided to go to a clinic, got tested for all STDs and told the doctor about the situation (which was really hard for me to be honest). We're still together and we bang (but safely!).

That's great and all, but then this one time we were laying in bed together cuddling and talking then we start talking about exes and he nonchalantly says that he still sees his. This is a full grown man, so I'm not going to pretend that he has never known a guy before me. Turns out he was with this guy since basically before I was born and they were together for 16 years, apart for 2. But they hung out two days ago, he says that he's very close to his ex's family and he even still goes to birthday parties and plans to use a family member's cottage. Clearly it was an amicable separation (they were/are married, I actually just realized as I'm writing this that I don't even know if they're divorced) and *it was* 2 years ago, but it made me uncomfortable. They split based around a lot of straining factors (disease (kind of), different goals, wanting to try other people and things) so he assures me that it's over for real.

Am I right to be uncomfortable? It also made me **excessively** sad because it made me realize that I'm just this thing on the side (then spiraled into a depression that I'll always be somebody's on the side and now I'm here). Clearly he's still affected by his ex and he's dating a university kid; he really only wants sex. You don't get with a university kid for their emotional maturity, let's be honest now. I don't understand what I can get out of this. He's very gentleman like and he actually responds to me when I speak without looking at a phone or changing topics abruptly (yes, those are the standards) so I'm happy to be with him. I feel dirty and kind of like a whore and it really feels like I'm just sleeping with him until he figures his shit out. This isn't to sound like a victim, I enjoy the sex and he's good in bed. 

The other part of this is I don't know what else is he keeping from me. I don't know if I should trust him or if it's worth it. It seems like he's progressively more interested in dating me, but is this a good idea? Is it normal for partners to keep this much in touch after they dated for so many years or should I be worried?

**TL;DR** Met a guy who didn't straight up tell me his HIV+ status, but I empathized with how he must have felt cornered and stigmatized. Now he nonchalantly tells me that he's keeping in touch with his 16 year ex and I don't know if I should freak out. Is it normal for partners to keep in touch after a 16 year relationship? Is this guy to be trusted?

This morning I woke up from a dream in which my mom was holding me in her lap - It was like a memory-dream or something, but the way she was holding me close to her chest gave me the absolute worst sensation of horror and discomfort I've felt in a long time when I woke up.. Bug-crawling-on-my-skin-level stuff.

I have theorized my whole life why *exactly* I am attracted to men - I sometimes think the root of my homosexuality is actually a very strong fear of intimacy with women and aversion to female bodies. I find vaginas sexually appealing but the rest of the female body makes no sense to me so I have no interest in women because of that.

I even strongly dislike being touched by women at all, I stopped letting my mom touch me when I was probably 9 or 10. Even accidentally grazing a female friend's breasts causes an involuntary recoil on my part which has lead to a number of awkward moments to say the least.

Add to this, that even though I have felt this way as long as I can remember, my best friends as a teenager were female. However, all of those friendships ended horribly with some kind of betrayal on their part. 

As of the last few years I've had these recurring episodes of misogyny and internal dialog along the lines of ""Women are scary, the way their minds work is scary, their bodies are scary"" and it makes me not want to be around females at all.

What is my deal? It's one thing to be attracted to men and male bodies (which I am) but it's another to have an equally strong disdain for women and female bodies. How can I get over this bizzare irrational fear of female minds/bodies? I used to have great friendships with girls but now I can't even see myself having a female friend without being weirded out by it and I feel like it's holding me back in life. Is this normal at all?

Me: 21, adopted at birth, weird childhood (religious family, homeschooled) and moved out when I was 16.

Thanks guys.

**TL;DR: I have a strong internalized fear of females and female bodies and it's confusing as shit. Is this why I'm gay? What's the deal?**

I know I'll get over it eventually but I feel like I \*need\* to have fun right now while I'm young and un-committed to anyone.

Anyway, I just spent the last day and a half trying to find someone to fool around with on Grindr. On 2 occasions, I actually sent someone my location and was ready to meet them, but they bailed/didn't respond. I've gotten like 50 messages but 2/3rds of them are from old guys 35+ and and other 1/3rd are just downright unattractive/butterface people. It's starting to make me believe that people on Grindr are biased toward the unattractive/desperate types, and that if you really want to meet cool, hot gay guys, you have to go to a club.

Sorry if I come across as full of myself. I'm a pretty attractive guy and I'm also pretty picky. I just don't see how it can be so amazingly easy to hook up on these apps like everyone here claims it is.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going through a phase where I&amp;#39;m kinda discovering the whole hookup scene and exploring my sexuality. I know I&amp;#39;ll get over it eventually but I feel like I *need* to have fun right now while I&amp;#39;m young and un-committed to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I just spent the last day and a half trying to find someone to fool around with on Grindr. On 2 occasions, I actually sent someone my location and was ready to meet them, but they bailed/didn&amp;#39;t respond. I&amp;#39;ve gotten like 50 messages but 2/3rds of them are from old guys 35+ and and other 1/3rd are just downright unattractive/butterface people. It&amp;#39;s starting to make me believe that people on Grindr are biased toward the unattractive/desperate types, and that if you really want to meet cool, hot gay guys, you have to go to a club.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry if I come across as full of myself. I&amp;#39;m a pretty attractive guy and I&amp;#39;m also pretty picky. I just don&amp;#39;t see how it can be so amazingly easy to hook up on these apps like everyone here claims it is.&lt;/p&gt;
