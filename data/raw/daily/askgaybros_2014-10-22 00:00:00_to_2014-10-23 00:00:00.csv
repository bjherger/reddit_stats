This hasn't proved problematic until now.

I wanted him to come to a concert with me on a Saturday night, and he seemed very excited for it, even adding extra plans to the mix, like spending the day in New York before we go to the concert...  I haven't seen him in 2 weeks already, so it'd be the first time I've seen him in a month (and the first time I've had to go a month without seeing him).

Now, I just got a text saying he can't go because he has to study for a test on the following Monday... 2 days later... and he also told me he's studying right now...

I don't know what to do, if there's anything to do,if I'm being over-sensitive, if this really does seem weird to others... I don't know...  I love him though :/

Please help guys?

EDIT: The concert is 10 days from now.EDIT 2: We had a chat, and it is okay.  He knows how paranoid I can get (it's been diagnosed), and he reassured me everything is okay...

1. To 'book' a checkup, do you just ring your GP and schedule it for the same day? Different day? What time of day? Obviously I wouldn't want to be rushed out the door if it was peak hour at the office since it's a non-urgent thing, or something (which I've basically had happen to me on one of my few instances at my GP's office).

2. For a checkup, is it just a set amount of time with set questions / examinations, or can you voice other concerns as well? For example, I have a minor shoulder injury that I want something done about and I have some mental health issues (I need a referral for a therapist). 

3. Are there any shots I should ask for, being gay and whatnot? Not sexually active yet, unfortunately.

4. This isn't so much of a problem, but... what does a checkup generally involve? I've had a brief doctor's visit for an employment health check, but I'm not sure if that was a full exam or...

5. I don't even know if any of you would be able to answer this, but how do I go about the billing process involving my (Australian) health care card? I have no idea how bulk billing works.

Title says everything.

I don't have many particular fears, but I have a huge phobia of thunders. I like calm rain, but if it gets too heavy and windy it gets me nervous, and if there's thunders, I get absolutely terrified. Like heart-pounding, shaking, need-to-sit-down-and-cover-my-ears anxious. It was worse when I was younger, but it's better now. If my SO is at home I can handle it quietly, but he knows it's hard for me so he'll try and do something like putting in a movie to distract me and snuggle until I fall asleep. If he's not, I'll hold our dog Ducky, he's also terrified of thunders, so I try to calm him down and that usually calms me as well.

Another fear I have is of syringes, but this one is very specific. I fucking *hate* hospitals, and they make me anxious enough, but the fucking *worst* to me is syringes, having to take shots or have blood taken, and IV bags (I don't have, for example, fear of getting a tattoo - it's very hospital-related). Luckily I am a very healthy person and never had to really go to the hospital ever - until earlier this year. I got viral meningitis and had to stay a week in the hospital with an IV bag in me, constantly taking shots and having blood taken. That was one of the worst experiences of my entire life. I had nothing to make it better, so I had to just deal with it. Hopefully I never have to go through something like that ever again.

E: Also, adding to my fear of syringes: when I was like weeks old, they had to take blood from me. I was a pretty fucking fat baby, so the nurse stabbed me like over 30 times - according to mom - to find my veins and he couldn't find them, so she made him stop because before my baby arm turned into swiss cheese. Then, when I was about 3-4, I still had a pretty bad phobia about it but I understood when I had to take blood and mom couldn't just lie and take me to the room. So when I saw the doctor coming with a syringe, I literally *screamed* for help with all my might as if someone was abusing me, and they had to get two doctors to hold me in place and another one to take the blood. So.. yeah. I think I'm better now. lol

Other, more mild fears include the girls from The Exorcist, The Ring and The Grudge. Honestly, fuck those cunts. I'm pretty sure they have something to do about my aversion to vaginas these days. /s

Anyways, bros, what are *your* fears? How do you deal with them?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello, all! Title says everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t have many particular fears, but I have a huge phobia of thunders. I like calm rain, but if it gets too heavy and windy it gets me nervous, and if there&amp;#39;s thunders, I get absolutely terrified. Like heart-pounding, shaking, need-to-sit-down-and-cover-my-ears anxious. It was worse when I was younger, but it&amp;#39;s better now. If my SO is at home I can handle it quietly, but he knows it&amp;#39;s hard for me so he&amp;#39;ll try and do something like putting in a movie to distract me and snuggle until I fall asleep. If he&amp;#39;s not, I&amp;#39;ll hold our dog Ducky, he&amp;#39;s also terrified of thunders, so I try to calm him down and that usually calms me as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another fear I have is of syringes, but this one is very specific. I fucking &lt;em&gt;hate&lt;/em&gt; hospitals, and they make me anxious enough, but the fucking &lt;em&gt;worst&lt;/em&gt; to me is syringes, having to take shots or have blood taken, and IV bags (I don&amp;#39;t have, for example, fear of getting a tattoo - it&amp;#39;s very hospital-related). Luckily I am a very healthy person and never had to really go to the hospital ever - until earlier this year. I got viral meningitis and had to stay a week in the hospital with an IV bag in me, constantly taking shots and having blood taken. That was one of the worst experiences of my entire life. I had nothing to make it better, so I had to just deal with it. Hopefully I never have to go through something like that ever again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E: Also, adding to my fear of syringes: when I was like weeks old, they had to take blood from me. I was a pretty fucking fat baby, so the nurse stabbed me like over 30 times - according to mom - to find my veins and he couldn&amp;#39;t find them, so she made him stop because before my baby arm turned into swiss cheese. Then, when I was about 3-4, I still had a pretty bad phobia about it but I understood when I had to take blood and mom couldn&amp;#39;t just lie and take me to the room. So when I saw the doctor coming with a syringe, I literally &lt;em&gt;screamed&lt;/em&gt; for help with all my might as if someone was abusing me, and they had to get two doctors to hold me in place and another one to take the blood.

Writing this from the comfort of home while I recover from a surgery I had last week for the excision of a pilonidal cyst. I'm writing because pilonidal cysts are statistically shown to be more prevalent among men between 18-35 (this is an arithmetically averaged range derived from conversations with 5 physicians, some of whom are colorectal surgeons) and I figure among 10000+ readers, there has to be one gay guy here who also had a pilonidal cyst.  

But here is the trick to the equation, and why I'm writing. I'm a 20 y.o. bottom, and while I've had sex with my boyfriend while living with the pilonidal cyst, I happily wait for a day where there is no longer pain in that region of the body that can make sex unenjoyable or excessively difficult. I have stories for days, but I won't share here.  

I've tried to keep this PG, but if anyone can give some advice or experiential writing on the matter of recovery, I would really appreciate it. I see my plastic surgeon tomorrow, but I have a feeling you all would be more knowledgeable than he would.  

**TL;DR: When is my pilonidal cyst-less butt ready for sex?**  

EDIT: Had to change the number of readers for this sub...there are more readers on /r/GayBros, which I hoped would give me a broad range of responses, but I had to note the number of readers on this one.

I'm 18/M/UK. Let me begin by clearing up a few things:

Sex in general doesn't turn me on - whether with men or with women. Frankly, I have no experience with either - but every time I've watched porn or seen naked people; neither guys or girls do anything for me. They just seem like naked bodies - and I'm not attracted to either on their own.

From this, I guess I think about myself as 'not gay, but not straight either'. It's the only way I can describe myself. I guess you'd call that asexuality, except...

I'm kinky as hell. I have no idea why, but kink stuff (BDSM etc) is the only thing that gets me going - and when it does, I usually picture it where I'm in a kink scenario with another dude. Again, I have no experience of that either. I'm not into the vanilla side (sex, oral etc)... but I go crazy over those thoughts about being tied up etc by a more powerful/dominant guy.

Now I'm just at a stage where I don't know who I am. What do I tell my friends?! I don't believe I'm gay. But again, I'm not straight either.

I worry that soon I might be wanting to get in a relationship and have the company of someone else. I don't want to get with a girl and have her think I can't get horny for her, but I also don't want to get with guys and have them think I'm not into them either. 

Help please? Am I being irrational by worrying for the future? At the same time I know I shouldn't stress and I'll find out eventually, I just don't like not knowing myself. Thanks.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is my xpost from askgsm.&lt;/p&gt;

I started dating a new guy and we had a nice date over the weekend.  Date aside, he talks about his exes a lot and he's kind of had a lot of them.

I wouldn't think much of it, but yesterday his last ex apparently texted him and ruined his day and made him feel like shit again, just like when they broke up.  I didn't hear much from him other than message about how he was tired of the bs from this dude, and people suck.

This is when I end up not caring about homework and shit. Now when I edge long enough, or more edge period, I shoot more, and in longer distance/whatever the fuck.

Now, say I edge for a long ass time, sometimes even for an hour or so, I'll shoot hard enough to where my load goes fucking everywhere. I've had it hit the ceiling (just a drop or two), and a couple times a wall behind me, though there are times where only a little bit goes over my shoulder or around my sides. Just a drop or two it looks like, and I go ""oh shit"".

Finish cleaning up myself, then look for the rest, and if it's just that couple of drops, guess where it goes? I can scour the carpet, the sheets, wherever the fuck I look, there is no trace that I shot onto something other than myself. These rare moments, where only a little goes off course (not everywhere), no trace to where I swear I came hard enough for it to go light speed.

The worst part is trying to talk about this, I sound like a shit head. I have to know, this happen to anyone else? You swear you shot your load and it should've landed on the carpet, or on something, and you find no trace of it.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, I&amp;#39;ll jerk off for a LONG while, I&amp;#39;ll fucking edge.
