I have been meeting guys for dates off Okcupid and some other sites/apps that are not hookup oriented. I find it hard to sustain a conversation with guys; I feel that I have lost the ability to connect with guys without physical action.

When I hook up with guys, I usually meet them at a public place, like a cafe, talk a bit and if we like each other's vibes we get down to business. I would start with cuddling and the physical closeness just helps with making myself and the other guy comfortable with each other.

I am such a failure at what today's society deem as a proper date, and I feel bad. They say you should talk about common interests and personal experiences, but everyone is so different. It's not like an interview where everything is formulaic and can be prepared.

Some say that I just haven't met the right person yet and when I do, conversations will flow easily and both of us would know. Some say that dating is just a numbers game and I just have to wade though a lot of guys until I find someone I can connect with.

Advice? How do I engage with guys outside of a sexual context? I need someone to teach me how to date.

I appreciate you in advance for reading.

Last October, I started coming out to my friends/family and becoming comfortable with being gay. I browsed all the apps/dating sites/etc until this past June I came across a guy I had seen around school and was in the music department with me. We talked and soon met in person. We spent the whole summer talking and going on amazing dates, anticipating school starting so we could be together more. He was perfect in every way: handsome, amazing smile, very mature, intelligent, ambitious, and most of all, he was accepting of me in a way that nobody else had ever tried to be. This is my first quasi-relationship and I was getting exited about the possibilities and being there to support him and having him there to support me. Things were going great.

School started and things were still going well. I'm a senior and he's a junior. We're both very busy and have full schedules. I have two jobs and take a full class load along with a student teaching placement and being president of my student organization for music education students. Needless to say, time is a hard thing to find, but I made time to see him whenever I could and we talked all the time. A couple weeks in, I felt the disconnect start to come. He was becoming too overwhelmed with work/exams. We celebrated his birthday together and I met his parents. Then things went slightly downhill but I held on to the hope that we would be okay. Then he asked to talk in early October and said he didn't feel ready for a relationship (we weren't formally dating at the time yet). He's been dealing with depression for a while and actually was hospitalized for it over the summer. He says he doesn't want anyone else caught up in his stuff and that he doesn't think he can handle the romantic/emotional part of a relationship right now nor does he want it. He instead wants to be friends.

Needless to say, I've been completely heartbroken. Not just because of the breakup, but because I don't want him to think that he's undeserving of love/affection because he's dealing with depression. I've been dealing with depression for my whole life. Every aspect of my life is a mess and it's led to my horrible depression and he was the one good thing I had. We still talk but it's always just me asking how he's doing/feeling. There have been a couple times where I ask a lot of questions trying to find out the reason why things had to end. I keep blaming myself and he keeps insisting that I did nothing wrong and that it's just his feelings that changed and he only sees me as a friend. I'm so hurt because I see him as more than that and I was so hopeful for something and once again, my hopes got destroyed. I want to be more than friends, even if that doesn't mean boyfriends, necessarily. I can't pretend like I don't know him on that level. I can't pretend like his smile doesn't light up my heart or that I could stare into his eyes forever. I can't act like I don't find him attractive and miss his little quirks. Calling him my friend feels like a lie but I can't cut him off because 1) he needs someone to be there for him while he goes through these things and I said I would be there for him and 2)I don't want to lose contact with him over something he can't control. It's not like he did anything to me (ie cheat on me, etc.) that gives me a reason to cut him out of my life. But I want him to be more than just my friend. I don't care as much about losing the romantic aspect as I care about losing him. The romantic part was just an added bonus of knowing him.

Nothing about depression/suicide drives me away from him. I just want to be there for him and I want the relationship we have to only make him feel better and lift him up, not stress him out. I can't focus on anything. I think about him and how badly I miss him all the time. Everyone is telling me to cut him out, but I just can't. Maybe it's just because he's the first guy I've really liked and been with, but I think there's something special about him. I just can't seem to convince him no matter what I do or say. Please help. How do I deal with this?

Usually i lurk video game related things and the front page. But i feel like I'm in need of some help and was directed to this subreddit.

I've wanted to tell my parents (at least my mother) about being gay, which I'm almost sure my mom would be okay with it (I asked my mom when i was about 10-11 if she would still love me if i were gay and she said she would but she would be a little dissapointed, THIS IS A BIG REASON I HAVEN'T TOLD HER) 

I have several non-diagnosed mental problems that have caused me to go see a doctor, where i had to tell that i don't have any ""real life"" friends (I don't) and i spend most my time with my internet friends, which mean more to me than anyone. They mean so much to me in fact that one of them is my boyfriend. Sadly we live 5,447 mi (8800 KM) away from each other in a different country. Back to the doctor and talking about only having internet friends, every time this has come up my mom and doctor would get upset and tell me that they're pretty much kinda bullshit, and i need to just get some real life friends.

This brings me to one of my biggest problems i'm TERRIFIED of people and meeting people and talking to people, often i'm too scared to go to the store or pick up the phone. i find it easier to talk to people in English than in my native language.

So i have a boyfriend that lives in a different country, that i love so very much. We talk every day even though we recently went trough quite a rough patch. 

And i have a mom that doesn't believe my internet friends are ""real"" in the sense that they can be real relations, AND would be dissapointed if i were gay. But in general accepting of it. 

Add that to being anxious about talking to anyone and you there you have my problem

I've dated guys for years and overall family and friends have been very accepting. I never questioned it much. I even had really awful sex with a girl once and that kinda cemented the feeling that I was in fact gay. In the last five years though I haven't had any serious relationships and I only have sex less than once a year. I just don't find guys attractive anymore. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I've never considered that I may be straight, or at least more straight than gay. So I've started to shop the idea around to friends. No one seems to accept it. They still refer to me as gay, try to introduce me to guys, etc. These are mostly straight friends too.

I very straight acting. I feel like I'm at least moderately attractive. But women never give me the time of day. And I don't know how to talk to them. Not that I haven't tried. So this is all speculation without having even dated a woman.

When I came out the first time everyone either accepted me or told me I would burn in hell. But they all believed me. Now I try and say that maybe I was wrong and they think it's a phase. I feel like I'm in some weird twilight zone episode.

Has anyone here gone through this or the opposite while coming out in their 30's?

TLDR: thought I was gay for a long time. Now I'm not so sure and i'm getting a lot of resistance from friends about it. Wtf?

Edit: Thank you for the thoughtful responses. This has been very stressful for me. It's nice to see that some people are still capable of listening.

","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, I came out of the closet as a teenager. I&amp;#39;ve dated guys for years and overall family and friends have been very accepting. I never questioned it much. I even had really awful sex with a girl once and that kinda cemented the feeling that I was in fact gay. In the last five years though I haven&amp;#39;t had any serious relationships and I only have sex less than once a year. I just don&amp;#39;t find guys attractive anymore. I guess what I&amp;#39;m trying to say is that I&amp;#39;ve never considered that I may be straight, or at least more straight than gay. So I&amp;#39;ve started to shop the idea around to friends. No one seems to accept it. They still refer to me as gay, try to introduce me to guys, etc. These are mostly straight friends too.&lt;/p&gt;

It's not that far fetched to think a master being created the universe; if one did, and you genuinely thought it wrote a handbook on how to conduct your life, would you really question it?  Life is fucking weird as shit and super trippy.  Incomprehensibly strange.  Electrons teleport.  Think about that.  Electrons teleport but god being real is far fetched?  

Stephen Colbert is religious.  Gandhi was religious.  MLK Jr was religious.  Finally hey religion can be used in bad ways but science can be used by some to justify eugenics.  You'd say ""no those eugenics people are nuts.""  So would the well adjusted religious person about the religious equivalent.

Please keep your comments about that to yourself.  It's what makes him happy and he really believes in it and it isn't hurting anybody and I'm not about to try to mess with that.  He's not self hating.  He's not anti-gay.  People are complicated.

Anyways, I texted him because I was 'bummed out that it didn't seem like he cared enough to be in regular contact.'  In reality he's super busy and he does genuinely get back to me, but sometimes has to wait a day or two when things get hectic.

So in reality I think I was bothered by something else.

Anyways he didn't get mad at me at all, just was very kind and explained (like he always does :] ), then I called him and we talked.

What I basically told him is that although we've probably only spent maybe 50-60 hours talking over the course of 5-ish weeks, as well as being very physically attracted to him (we're both into kink in very matching ways), I've fallen for him pretty quickly for very valid reasons

+ he's super interesting and very different from me in ways that I find enriching (absolutely loathe the 'find your clone!' Ok Cupid-esque model of dating)

+ he's really kind and friendly

+ he shares a lot of my academic interests

+ he's intelligent

+ he's very supportive

+ he's funny

+ etc

and I don't want to lose him, but it bothers me a lot that our budding relationship basically has an expiration date.  Also, as he explained to me on the phone, if I meet somebody without an expiration date, and we get in a serious relationship that lasts a few years, we could plan our next steps in a way that would allow us to still be together without compromising anything major.

He said he feels the same way about me as I feel about him - really liking me in many different ways - and agreed about the conflict.  

When we're together physically there's a real emotional connection. But it would be super rough to adjust from being his lover to him flying off to another continent to do the priest thing.  Also I don't want to give up time I could've spent potentially finding someone who could be a life partner.  Finally, a lot of the love and support we give eachother 

1. is totally translatable into a close friendship

2. can be done from anywhere (I moved timezones early this year and am still in regular contact with my close friends; doesn't feel different)

So the conclusion is that we're going to become close friends.

I feel good about this right now.

Maybe not completely stoked.

But okay.

I feel okay.

Overall I'm standing by this decision regardless of whatever comments flood in, and am just sharing in case anybody else finds it useful.

Thanks for the various input and thanks for reading.

It went something like this...

A&amp;U: Being gay is wrong, you know that, right?

Me: Actually, it's that opinion that is, in fact, wrong.

A&amp;U: The bible says a man shall not lay with another man as...etc...

Me: it also says pork is unclean and you should kill people who work on sunday.

A&amp;U: it's a waste that two beautiful women can't be with men, they are biologically incompatible.

Me: Isn't Christianity about love? If two people love each other, how can that be wrong?

A&amp;U: We have seven friends who've died of AIDS.

Me: AIDS isn't a homosexually transmitted disease, it's a sexually transmitted disease...it affects straight people too.

A&amp;U: What if you had a son that was gay?

Me: I would love him regardless of who he was attracted to. His choice of partner does not affect my connection to him. Same with a daughter.

A&amp;U: Well you don't have a son so you couldn't possibly know that's how you'd react. How do your parents feel about this?

Me: Not that it matters, because I'm an adult and have my own opinions, but I think they're in agreement.

A&amp;U: We don't think so.

Me: Once again, irrelevant. Persecuting someone for their inherent nature is wrong. It's no different from persecution of minorities (we're a multi racial family, this just throws them into a frenzy)

A&amp;U: (Upset) It's completely different. There's no groups that are organized that persecute them actively!

Me: You mean like, Christians? Homosexuality occurs in nature.

A&amp;U: Well those animals are diseased and wrong also. (stretching for facts, rationalizing, circular logic, bible verses)

Me: It's obvious that we aren't going to come to consensus on this, just know that although I love you both, I think you're completely wrong about this.

(Conversation continues, details foggy, but eventually turns gradually towards other topics)

I feel like I should have said different things, stated more facts, something! I feel like I should've tried harder.

I'm in college and I've always dated girls. My question has to do with whether or not I'm ""acrually gay"" and how to handle it.

So here's the deal. I'm usually repulsed about the idea about being with another guy, but I'm extremely attracted to the anatomy. Specifically the cock and balls(and what comes out of them). In porn I usually focus much more on the penis, especially in blowjobs. The weird part is that I get very horny towards the idea of sucking a guy off or taking it in the ass only a few times a month. This urge doesn't seem to have any distinct triggers, seemingly completely random. Meanwhile I'm still repulsed about the idea of being with another guy.

I just rescently had my first experience with one of my friends and I'm torn. I don't really know him to well, just have a single physics class together, except for that he openly identifies as homosexual. I noticed he expressed interest in me and constant flirted with me  whitch i usually played it off as a joke. 




So heres what happened(WARNING NSFW):





 Last friday I had another one of these ""urges"" and i started fantasizing about my gay friend.  A little background. he's a few inches taller than me (5'9"") and has an athletic build, with short black hair. I on the other hand work out pretty often, but I'm not on his level yet. I'm more lean than muscular. I've been told by some of my exes that I have a girls ass(lol).

Anyways. I texted him to see if he wanted to hang out. He ended up inviting me to his apartment where we just played cod for a while and drank some whiskey. Things started up when I jokingly asked if he'd""sucked a dick lately""(honestly don't remember what led me to say that. Probably a cocktail of hormones and ""re-direction of blood"") to which he gave me a puzzled look followed by an awkward silence. He saw me ""peeking"" at him every once in a while and by this point he knew what was going on. He confronted me by asking straightforward asking if I was into guys. I felt my face reddening and replied by basically saying I'm not sure extremely nervously. He smirked and asked me if I wanted to experiment and offered me a blowjob. I declined the offer explaining that I wanted to be the one providing the service. I got on my knees and just waited(a very sureal moment looking back) in front of him as he hastingly unbuckled his belt and nearly tore his pants trying to take them off. Next came the underwear revealing my prize. My heart was probably beating faster than the time I finished running a mile in 6:47sec consequently making me HUNGRY. He was completely shaved including his ballsack and asshole completley bare except for a small region where his pubes where trimmed around the pelvis. As far as size goes it wasn't too big, probably between 6 and 6.5"", but there was a sort of beauty to it. His head was cherry red and plump, being fully erect at this point. I grabbed it by the base and looked up at him. He had these ""drunk"" gleaming eyes with a lustful look on his face. No words needed to be said, I knew what to do. I started by kissing and licking his inner thighs working my way to his balls. At this point I was HARD I mean just the pressure against my jeans could have made me burst. I decided to undress only leaving my undershirt on. I tried to re-inact what is saw in porn by drooling on his dick and ""breathing"" on it making sure not to touch it with my mouth while kissing the surrounding areas. I was probably really sloppy in retrospect, but he had these trembles in his breathe and had his head back leading me to beleive I was doing at least one thing right. I slowly started stroking making sure all my spit was spread around evenly and then put his entire ballsack into my mouth and playing around with it meanwhile stroking his shaft. After probably 2min of playing with his balls and stroking him i decided to start what I've been dreaming of all my life whitch was to suck a dick and swallow the cum while feeling it pulsing in my throat. I let go, looked up and licked his dick like a lolipop starting from his balls to the tip and immediately started bobbing my head once I reached the top. He was probably surprised and sick of being teased seeing that he stood up and grabbed the back of my neck. That day I realized why I didn't have a gag reflex. He had a slight downward curvature making it a perfect fit for my  throat. He told me, commanded me to look at him and then he told me he wanted to fuck my mouth. I just nodded with his dick still in my mouth and he started thrusting. I remember the feeling of his pubes brush against my face and his look of pure ecstacy. I took breaths in between by pulling back. The last time I pulled back he didn't release instead pulling me closer and started thrusting. He pulled out after about 10 seconds whitch left me gasping for air. I was slightly freaked out, but oddly LOVED it. He was also breathing heavily and told me that he wanted to fuck me. I had played with toys before so I thought nothing of it and agreed on the condition that he would finish in my ass and instead in my throat to whitch he grinned. He kissed me then rather violently and then grabbed me by the ass and led me to what I assumed would be his bedroom.


 By now I felt like i wasn't even thinking, I was fullfilling a need. Again no words where said, there was this deep sort of connection between us that we shared then. As he led me along he noticed that I was still completely erect and complimented my size (7""). He ended up leading me to his balcony to my surprise (whitch was completely enclosed although slightly chilly and overlooking the surrounding area whitch was mostly other apartments and suburban homes with zooming traffic in between), but the counter was low and the idea turned me on so I didnt protest. He made out with me, but more gentky this time while squeezing my ass cheeks. He told me to bend over to whitch I mindlessly did and started licking my asshole all while I was facing the window revealing a few cars zooming by, but mostly dark with a few visible lit rooms from building in the distance. He stopped, poored some lube onto my lower back, trickling down between my cheeks and then stuck 1 finger in then pulling out to add extra this time slipping in 2 fingers inside of me. Then he whispered in my ear sending tingles down my spine asking me ""you like that don't you bitch? You want to be fucked by a man."". After pulling his fingers out of my ass he stuck them in my mouth and then casually asked me if I had any stds to whitch I replied no. 


Before I could even think he started slowly pushing his bare dick deep into me from the first initial entry. I was alarmed and panicked. The thought of him not wearing a condom while being initially penetrated gave me a literally raging hard on. I didn't say a word. I knew the risk, I didn't care (stupid I know). All of the danger combined(being fucked bareback by a classmate that was openly gay while  overlooking the city with a lit background meaning someone could possibly spot us) I didn't care l loved it. Once he was completely inside me he asked me if it hurt at all to whitch I nodded ""no"" exclaiming that I used toys before. He firmly grabbed my by the waist and  started very slowly thrusting  not completely removing his dick. Subtly increasing his pace he was **pounding** me before I knew it with the total length of his dick. His ballsack was slapping against mine making me oddly even more aroused. Now I had trouble finding and stimulating my g-spot on my own with marginal success even with the help of toys, but this sensation was compltely new. Pure bliss. Every time his head passed by what was probably 4"" inside of my ass It felt soooooo goood. Oh my god I cant even describe it. I felt my penis pulsing each time it went in and out; a sensation I never felt. I started moaning as he was  panting with every thrust. Probably around 3 minutes in, for some reason my thoughts shifted to my girlfriend. The idea of her probably being asleep at her parents home while I, her boyfriend was being ruthlessly and willingly fucked by another guy brought me over the edge. My legs began shaking and I knew what was about to happen. Too whitch I nearly screamed ""Harder, Fuck Me Hatder!"". The intensity made me erupt. I threw my head back and closed my eyes and for those short few seconds I was in heaven, paradise, whatever you want to call it. He kept thrusting and my legs where involuntarily shaking while my penis started pulsing so powerfully that I'm surprised that I sustained consciousness the entire time. I onloaded string upon string of sperm onto the hardwood floor below. 

After i came, i realized how foolish i was and a sense of guilt washed over me. He kept thrusting for a probably a minute after while my legs where violently shaking. He pulled out telling me how hott that was and that never happened with anyone else he was with. Something caught his eye and he left the room telling me to wait. I was now flacid and angry at myself. He came back again and before I could say anything started kissing me while stroking my cock as it slowly  grew while he tightly grasped it in his hand. I was more or less horny again and had this angry sexual energy. He brought back a buttplug with the other end formed to be like a foxes tail. He then without a word slid it up my ass. He grew visibly hornier and looked like he wanted to literally eat. I being his prey and him being the predator. He then got down on all fours and licked the pool of cum that I left on the floor and grabbed my face again making out with me. Writing this makes me feel like he was crazy, but I just became more aroused. His hands creaped down my body and settled at my ass whitch he then slapped and held onto all while making out with me. I had my hands around his face the entire time. We french kissed for what seemed like the better of half an hour exhanging the taste of my own cum between eachother. 

He brought me back into his bedroom and told me to lay down. I slowly grew more horny and lustful. I don't know what he did, but that was the best blowjob of my life even considering that I just experienced the best orgasm of my life not 1 hour ago. It took no more than 1 minute and I was at that point again. I told him to stop and that I wanted him in my mouth (while I was still in the mood). But he wasn't finished yet. He grabbed my ankles dragging me to the edge of the bed and throwing my legs above his shoulders whilst removing my buttplug and deliberatley licking it. Then he was in me again. Pounding me while maintaining eye contact and simultaneouley stroking me with his hand.  I was horny as hell the entire time lost in the pleasure. Soon enough  he again said ""holy shit I'm going to cum"". He pulled out and I re-arranged myself so now my head was hanging over the side of the bed. He stood over me trumping me and deliberatley placed his sac on my face and dragged it along. I remember the texture as being something so large, smooth, beutiful and warm. He saw that I was in aww and proposed his penis to my mouth whitch I gladly accepted. I played with the tip and ridge for a while. Something about the texture and feel of his penis just lights a fire inside of me. I had the most beautiful site above me to whitch made me even more passionate. I pulled it out and told him to fuck my throat until he cums and to not pull out before. As opposed to his previous tendancies, he started thrusting full swing from the get go. I felt his ball sac bounce off of my nose, completely engulfing it and then coming back up. Soon he began **bashing** my throat slowly, but with significant force preparing for the golden moment. Then he came in completley with his balls resting on my face. I could feel his cock starting to pulse and his balls literally spasm, gripping my nose and soon after I felt a stream of thick seamen flowing down my esophugus. He pulled out and got on top of me and started making out again while we sort of rubbed cocks while making out to whitch I came a second time on my stomach. That same guilty and confused feeling came back, but I was too exausted to think. We slept together that night and had sex the following morning in whitch he came inside of me, and he ate my cum. After that it was kind of awkward so I left on a neutral note. 

The sex was incredible, but I don't see myself ever being in a relationship with him or another guy for that matter. I still love my girlfriend and I'm usually repulsed thinking back to what I did. I don't know why I get these urges or what they make me. What do I do? He texted me a few times since then saying that he wants to see me again,  but I just don't (atleast now). Should I tell my girlfriend?

So basically, they are both very good friends of mine. He's been a friend for almost a year, and she's always been my roommate and friend since i don't know when, and he moved in with us a couple of months ago.

He's a very understanding and caring guy that i developed some feelings for him, although i never anticipated to seriously let him know what i felt, cuz it'd be more comfortable for both of us to keep the friendship as it was.

Things changed when she told me someday that she's in love with this guy, and he tends to respond positively (yeah, she's also close enough to discuss these types of things). 

I'd really wish them the very best, and always tried to live under the same roof, and hang out as if nothing happens, but their being affectionate is actually driving me crazy. 

So now I'm in the dilemma that, for one, i know it's probably best for me to move out and have a ""new"" life, but on the other hand, i'm reluctant to give up the friendship as they are very close friends of mine.

I started working at this new place a month ago and it's been really awesome. I get along with everyone on my floor, I actually like my manager on a personal level- everything is awesome!

This one guy, however, wanted to make me feel welcome, so he started off by having lunches with me and getting to know me etc. and I REALLY appreciated it. We have a lot of things in common and he's fantastic. The only thing is, I've noticed that he's starting to build his schedule around me and it makes me uncomfortable because I think he's really attractive. He'll walk the long way around so that he passes by my desk, he's had to work on a different floor and he came by just to say hi, he'll walk with me when I have to go anywhere and he's had every lunch with me so far, we've went out for drinks and again, it's really great, but I can't help but think ***not again***. Seriously though, not another straight guy. The thing is, I know I'm flirting with him and I honestly can't help it. 

I KNOW he has a girlfriend, I know he's straight, we've talked about that too. But I also told him that I'm seeing a chick or two. The thing is, I know he's okay with gay dudes, but I just don't feel comfortable coming out at work. I don't have a good reputation yet and I don't want to risk harassment from the opinionated crowd. 

I would come out to him, but it's going to change things between us too and I really like the secret alliance going on. I love the frequent jokes throughout the day and I've used goofing off with him as motivation to work and it's been super effective. So far he's been very friendly and I'm not going to lie, I like the fact that I've made a good friend at work. He's invited me over to show off his grilling skills and video games and I asked to reschedule- I honestly don't know if I can handle it. The thing is, the more time we spend together the more I'll fall for him and I know that.

I know he sees me just as a really good friend especially since I like a strange mix of cult things that make sense to only us. If I were straight then I would have met my best friend, but I'm not and I feel like me being gay is ruining everything.

Id suspected it for a while, and i was glad he was able to finally tell me, but now im having trouble not acting like its different. Im not gay, and i told him that and that i didnt want our friendship to change, but im starting to notice things being different.


 I cant talk to anyone about it because i have a pretty close friend circle and i told him i wouldnt tell anyone. I tried talking to a mutual friend about it, but she just said that it was about time and sorta blew off my concerns. About a week later he told me thank you for not sleeping with a girl at my house but instead going to her place. I sorta figured he meant that it was because he naturally wouldnt want to hear me have sex, but it also struck me as strange because hed never said anything about me bringing a girl back before.

 So what was odd was last night i went out with him and some friends, and everything was cool and then i started talking to a girl at the bar. All of my other friends were all ""yeah shes hot go for it"", but he started giving me dirty looks as if i was doing something wrong. He started getting progressively madder at me and kept pestering me which sort of annoyed me. Ive never really had a friend not support me to get a girl at bar, and he kept being like ""lets go somewhere else"" and ""your friends want to leave"". 

So we go to another bar and id already gotten her number but she came with us. This girl buys us a round of drinks and we go upstairs, and then he started getting really aggressive and i just became uncomfortable. Im talking and dancing with this girl, and he says"" make her buy us another drink"" and i was like, nah that's rude. Then he was like ""dont take this girl home"" and i said ""why?"" And he said ""have some empathy"". At this point the girl started to seem really drunk, so i told him to leave me alone for a second and he got really pissy. All i was trying to do was tell this girl bye because she was barely keeping it together and im not about bringing a completely wasted girl home, but when i was like ""alright lets go"" he made a really snarky comment like ""oh now im a person?"". I was really annoyed at this point so i didnt really say anything, but his attitude came off as really possessive. This sort of comments continues for the rest of the night , but then in the morning he apologized. I wanna be supportive of him, but i was clear that im not interested in him and that there needs to be boundaries between us, and i really don't wanna have that conversation again. 


So i guess im sorta just wondering what to do at this point.

I say might because I have talked to him about it and he isn't sure either. He is a little introverted and shy. A few years ago, it somehow came up in conversation, and he deflected it. I guess I kind of thought he would explore it in a way which he was comfortable with. However, he is 25 now and is still uneasy about dating and his sexuality. We grew up in a pretty conservative and Catholic community, so I think that probably makes him a little hesitant about fully coming out. However, our family isn't that religious anymore and we are pretty liberal now. My mom and I both know that he may be gay and we are completely supportive. From what he's told us, we are the only one he's ever really mentioned this too, and even then, he is still very hesitant to talk about it. I think the most important thing is for him to talk to other people who are gay and to explore for himself. He doesn't know how to go about it and I don't know what to suggest. He recently asked me for advice about an online dating profile he created. This was a really big step. However, it was on a heterosexual dating website and he said he was looking for men. I cautioned him that if he wasn't ready to come out to his friends, he should be wary as someone he knew could see this and I also didn't believe that this site would exactly be the best medium. I really don't think I am the best person to make suggestions, but I suggested that he try grindr. At least that way, he could talk to gay people in a more relaxed environment. However, he raised the point that a lot of people use this for simply hooking up, which was not what he was looking for. 

I want my brother to be comfortable with his sexuality, but he is pretty shy and sensitive. He has never been in a relationship or even dated.
