About 3 years later, when I actually had medical coverage and the curiosity to find out what the deal was, I went to another Doc and he told me it was probably herpes. I've realized that I had an outbreak or two (not while I was sexually active thankfully) in the past. I am also bipolar and this news sent me into depression for quite a long time. I've felt like no guy would ever want to be with me or want to start a relationship with me knowing they could possibly get this from me. I was abstinent for 2 years during my depression. I've recently been building my courage up to get back into the dating world. 
I've been on a couple dates with a guy I like. I'm struggling to figure out when I should break this news to him.

As the title reads, I'm having a hell of a time with my sexuality as of late, and what once was a quiet voice in the back of my mind is getting louder and louder. I've always been straight and always had a girlfriend... My only experimenting was when I was very young and a neighbor and I played truth or dare to touch/lick each others dicks, but that was it. 

Lately, I've been more and more attracted to the male anatomy. It started with developing a fetish for Trans Porn, and has started evolving into wanting to see guys getting fucked/giving head. I've noticed myself checking out ripped guys more and more lately. Another red flag for me is that I have trouble staying hard with my girlfriend(s). I feel somewhat disinterested in the sex... I always chocked it up to performance anxiety &amp; mild ED in the past, but I'm not so sure anymore.

Do you guys have any advice as to how I can better sort this out? I currently have a GF, and really don't want to cheat, but I'm not sure how else I'll have a definitive answer outside of talking things through with a therapist (which may be the best option).

For all intents and purposes I guess you could call me a ""baby gay"" since right after I came out I got into a long term relationship that lasted until recently. I'm new to the whole bar/cruising thing.

Anyway, I'm not socially awkward in low-stakes situations, like where I'm talking to a guy I'm not really into sexually, or meeting new people in general. This all changes when I see someone either at the bar or at the gym or wherever, that I'm attracted to.

I guess it's just a fear of failure paralyzing me, but I find myself at a complete loss for how to open the conversation. I'm not talking about a cheesy one-liner, but just a way to start the conversation to establish both ""hey I'm interested in talking to you"" and ""hey I think you're hot"". Whenever I muster the courage to talk to a guy I think is attractive I think I hold friendly conversations too long and they think I'm just being nice.

As a result, I end up settling for dudes that I'm not super into only because they approach me first, and it's not the best feeling in the world.

I always get weirded out when guys on grindr, okcupid, or even real life open conversations with ""hey sexy"" or ""you're hot"", so I've ruled that out as a potential opener.

I guess my question is: What's a good thing to open with when you're out and you see someone you like that won't lead to them thinking you're just talking to them to be nice/friendly?

&lt;p&gt;As a result, I end up settling for dudes that I&amp;#39;m not super into only because they approach me first, and it&amp;#39;s not the best feeling in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always get weirded out when guys on grindr, okcupid, or even real life open conversations with &amp;quot;hey sexy&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;you&amp;#39;re hot&amp;quot;, so I&amp;#39;ve ruled that out as a potential opener.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess my question is: What&amp;#39;s a good thing to open with when you&amp;#39;re out and you see someone you like that won&amp;#39;t lead to them thinking you&amp;#39;re just talking to them to be nice/friendly? I want my intentions to be known without being creepy.&lt;/p&gt;

Four shots and eight beers later we started to play spin the bottle which lasted the rest of the night. I'm a straight male who has never really questioned my sexuality. I haven't really entertained the idea of being with a man but I wont knock until I try it.

The male to female ratio was 3:2 and for the first time that night I kissed a guy (okay two guys multiple times). Presumably no big deal right? Then as the night moved on we felt adventurous and moved to body parts/areas where the navel became subject to tongue aduse. I was becoming particularly comfortable with one of the guys.
Inbetween sessions of spin the bottle I started to flirt - in an increasingly aggressive manner - with him. At one point we started wrestling for a bit in the kitchen like drunken manly men do. We threw a few playful punches around, tugged at limbs and had a death grip competition. I pulled him in a few times for another kiss but he always said no so I would let go. We kept horsing around.
Afterwards we stumbled out onto the deck. The subject came up and he repeatly told me he wasn't gay but was comfortable with me resting my legs on his lap. I'm pretty sure I had my foot on his crotch.
I asked for his number and without hesitation he insisted I give him my number first so I did. Nothing physical happened that night between the two of us past a few kisses and a navel lick. 

I am upset with myself because I feel like I was being an asshole. I know I will see him around more often and I don't want things to be uncomfortable. What should I do? I haven't spoken to him since he left the following morning. I stupidly added him on facebook but he hasn't responded. Should I text and apologize?

My partner and I are both new to the same-sex relationship thing.  We had both only been in relationships w girls up until each other, and were best friends for about a year before our relationship took a physical turn.  We've been together for about half a year now as a ""couple"".  I honestly couldn't see myself with anyone else, everything is amazing.

It has become obvious that we both prefer to top.  Before our relationship, I had played around a little w anal masturbation, so I was a little more comfortable doing things down there.  As a result, I've bottomed for him a few times over the past few months.  I enjoy it, it feels really good, and I wouldn't mind being in this position about 80% of the time.  At the same time, I feel somewhat of a void in the bedroom, because I never get to actually penetrate.  I'm used to being in a relationship w a girl where I could hump away 5-6 nights a week.  I don't expect it to ever get to that level, but being able to do it once every few weeks is important to me if we want to make things last long-term (and we do).

Unfortunately, my partner has never played around with the back door, and isn't as comfortable experimenting.  It doesn't help that I have a very large anatomy.  As a result, he associates bottoming with pain and poop.  I've tried to put it in, and it doesn't fit without extreme pain.  The longest it's been in is about 5 seconds, with several days of uncomfortable bowel movements resulting.  We tried slowly stretching it with toys, but he has stopped trying, due to (1) the messiness, and (2) the fact he doesn't receive pleasure from it.  I bought a douche / enema kit, but he won't use it and regularly says that area is off limits due to cleanliness conditions.  It isn't that he doesn't want to satisfy me, I think it's more of him waiting for ""the perfect time"" to stretch / let me attempt.  That perfect time doesn't exist IMO, generally it takes a little work to get it in the right conditions back there.

I want our relationship to work more than anything in the world.  I have never been happier and I'm willing to do anything for my partner.  At the same time, I am getting frustrated.  I have told him that we can take it slow, I don't want to pressure him, but I don't feel like I will ever be completely sexually satisfied if this can't be part of our relationship, and that is a big deal.

Any advice for me or him would be much appreciated.  He claims he doesn't feel pleasure from it, but I feel like if he was 100% clean (didn't have to be anxious about a mess), and loose enough that there was no pain, then he could enjoy it more, although I'm ok with it never being his preference.  I will probably show him this thread at some point, we both could use some advice from people with more experience.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello Reddit!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My partner and I are both new to the same-sex relationship thing.  We had both only been in relationships w girls up until each other, and were best friends for about a year before our relationship took a physical turn.  We&amp;#39;ve been together for about half a year now as a &amp;quot;couple&amp;quot;.  I honestly couldn&amp;#39;t see myself with anyone else, everything is amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
