On to the story.

When I was a kid I always was attracted to guys as we all have been. I had some more feminine things that I would do like wear dresses or the desire to play with barbie dolls, but I always believed I was a boy. I always hung out with boys, I never really wanted to be a girl. I remember when my attraction to men became more apparent in middle school, and I wasn't quite as attracted to women as I was men. But I got to a point where I started becoming a feminine male, and then eventually I started telling people that I wanted to be a woman. But I only told them that because I was scared I was going to go to hell for being gay, and because being a woman was the only way I could truly do that and still have it be okay. But I also had this belief that it was wrong to be a transexual, so I had this slight hope that I would be a female pseudohermaphrodite. Needless to say, it wasn't the case. I remember at the end of this phase, I eventually came to the realization that I neither wanted to be a straight male, nor a straight female, rather I wanted to be a gay male. But I still had these ideas of being ashamed of being what most people would consider a traditional male.
I remember when I would get grouped in with the guys doing their stupid manly shit that I would be ashamed of them grouping me in with them, but at the same time while I've always related better with females, I've always seen myself as male. I remember having issues with taking my shirt off in the pool, hating sports, but also being content with being a somewhere down the middle kind of guy.
 I wasn't particularly over feminine, but I was never the epitome of masculinity either. I still to this day have discomfort in being a ""manly man"", but I'm kind of annoyed at the idea of being a woman.

What I'm getting at here, is that I want to be a man, as I am. Not a woman, and not an overly manly man. I firmly believe that gender is a social construct, and that you can choose what you identify as. But it's hard to hold onto that idea when everyone keeps telling me that you don't choose your gender identity and yadda yadda. I get really horrified that I might really be a woman. I don't want to be a woman. I like being a gay man. I've even considered the idea of being genderqueer, but I still would prefer to identify as a male. I remember several years ago when I started to feel comfortable doing some stereotypically male things that would otherwise be scary for me as someone who was scared to do certain masculine things (I was generally uncomfortable in my own skin growing up anyways. Not just with gender specific things. Just in general, I was over-sensitive to the way people perceived me and was sensitive to the slightest criticism). Any help you all can offer?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, so before I start on my rant here, let me just say that this could very well be me just over-stressing a non-existent situation.

Basically, I've met a guy around my age (he's almost 20, I'm 19) on PlanetRomeo and we started chatting for 2 days and met the third, went out and kept talking about everything knowing each other but nothing else happened. Then we went out a second time and had launch together but, still, nothing really happened and that was 2 weeks ago. We kept chatting on the phone pretty much every day and we seem to get on well, the only problem I have is that it's the first time I find myself to be the propositive in any kind of relationship so I feel like a fish out of water, mostly I'm afraid to seem sticky to him and I've no idea when to do the first move between us to try and push this kind of friendship further. 
Any advices?

Secondly, it really seems like i want to force something but it's not that, again i've expressed my thoughts in the wrong way, it's more about not knowing how to read some signs like long awkward silences, staying in the car without dropping for a lot more than needed or similar stuff.

I was interested in the idea of some kind of “fleshlight” like toy that we could use simultaneously. I know that most of these things are designed for solo use, and to accommodate one person. But, I wonder if it’s possible to get a masturbation sleeve that can accommodate two people at the same time?

But I’m assuming that an ordinary sleeve would be too small or uncomfortable to do this, given that we’re both of average size.

An alternative design concept I was thinking of would be to have the masturbatory sleeve placed on one guys junk and then have the other guy put insert his member in the opposite end. However, I haven’t seen anything like this.

So, my question would be whether they make masturbation sleeves for use by two people. If not, is there something else that could achieve the same effect?

I wanted to be clear, so I said (verbatim) ""I don't know how to date, and would just like to move really slowly"" and he said he's ok to leave it and doesn't need labels, he apologised for trying to classify things too early.

Our relationship is rock solid.  We rarely fight over anything.  the couple of times we ""fought"" we always were civil and ended up having conversations that deepened the relationship.

We have been dating for over 6 months now, and nothing in the relationship has gotten stale.  sex has gotten better, and we often talk about the future together.  We generally spend about 2-3 days a week together (he is in school about an hour away, so I usually spend the weekends with him).  

We are generally pretty honest with each other, and we don't hide anything. He knows my worst secrets, and probably knows more about me than anyone else in my life.  We are both out so, we aren't hiding the relationship from anyone,  we are pretty open about public affection too.

I'm stressed, and struggling with my emotions (I've been through counseling for anxiety and depression).  I struggle with self-doubt, and sometimes struggle to see what it is that he sees in me. 

Part of the mood swings are because we both quit smoking recently.  Its been a bit of a struggle getting there, but we have made really good progress.  I know It added to his stress level too, especially with finals coming up, and because he has a ton of projects due right now.  

He hasn't been getting much sleep and has been distracted lately, so our communication during the week hasn't been great.  we used to talk on the phone for 1-2 hours at night and text often during the day when we weren't around each other, but the last week has been difficult for both of us, so we haven't talked or texted as frequently.

I think I really needed someone to wake me up from my dream. After reading your opinions, I decided to confront him as soon as possible, so I called him and decided to meet during his lunch break. Unfortunately I missed one of your comments and I met him at his house. The discussion turned very nasty and I just stopped crying, but I guess it is better now than later.


So, I meet him and he is very kind. He apologizes for what he said, that even if he was stressed due to job related issues (he expected some sort of promotion, but he didn’t get it), he shouldn’t have told me that. I tell him that those words really hurt me and I want to understand why he is excluding me from part of his life. He starts with the common excuses, but I guess he understands that I don’t believe in them. So he starts talking about his decision that I can have a cat. I asked to keep a cat for a long time, but he has always refused.


This really bothers me. I’m not a kid that can be bought with a cat (even if I love cats), so I tell him that I don’t care about the cat, I just want to be treated like an equal in our relationship. Maybe my tone was probably a bit arrogant, but his response is awful. Sorry if I report (partially) the rough discussion, but I want to write it down so I can check it later if I have any doubt.


Him: So, now my kindness is not accepted anymore? Is it a crime if I want to do something for my boyfriend?

Me: No, you know that I would be super happy to have a kitten. But I would like you to treat me like a man.

H: Oh, the little girl wants to be a man! But the little girl never complained when I buy her videogames or those stupid expensive underwear.

M: You know that I have always liked your gift. Those were gifts to a boyfriend, not to a kid like this cat thing.

H: Sure, all boyfriends buy you a business class intercontinental ticket for your birthday or a $3000 rig. People that really love you do that, not generic “boyfriends”. But I guess I was living a lie, you are just a little slut that likes to milk his cash cow.

M: It’s not true. I have loved you from the first moment and still love you now.

H: You don’t even know what love is. 

M: I just want to be with the guy I met last year, the guy that I love. Take all your gifts back, I don’t care. I will also give you back the money for the tickets. I don’t know why you are thinking that I am with you for the gifts.

H: And how would you pay me back the tickets? Are you going to start a side business as a prostitute? I can write you a recommendation: “feels like a boyfriend”

M: Why are you saying this? Why are you so mean? And, you know that I will do an internship this summer.

H: Oh, yes. The internship I found you. Because you are too lazy to move your ass and do something for your future. Always watching stupid cartoons or playing videogames. But, I guess, who cares when there is the boyfriend paying?

M: Fuck the internship. I can find a little job. If you feel that our material differences are destroying our relationship, tell me and we can work on it.

H: Who is going to hire you? You are just a fucking kid that lives in his own fairy tale. Welcome to the real world, where you are worth nothing. The only things you have to offer are your baby face and your pink hole.

I prefer to not specify what he said after since it involved personal things, but they were very mean and full of anger statements.

I took my backpack, put inside the important things and left. He was sitting on the couch, staring blankly at the wall. Before closing the door, I told him “get help”.


I spent the last hours crying, but I somewhat feel lighter. I guess that it was something I have been thinking for sometimes, I just needed a kick in my ass from the reality and from you guys.
However, I also feel bad. I know so little about his life outside our relationship. So, I don’t know if something bad happened. I am thinking about contacting one of his friends, because I’m worried.


Thanks again for your help!

I just feel like sometimes I am the only person on earth that wants a relationship [21 by the way]. I have almost 800 message on Grindr (I'm on Grindr, OkC, Scruff, and Tinder) and no one has ever wanted to meet for a date or actually do anything. As soon as I bring it up, even after days of talking, I get no response or they just say that they want to hookup. Even people that seem serious at first or it says ""looking for dates"" in their profile just end up sending nudes after a while. I dunno but I just don't want to hook up, especially since I started watching [Mark and Ethan](https://www.youtube.com/user/mmabutternut/videos), I want something real. I had a brief fling with a guy in November but then I found out that I was ""the other guy"" so that was fun.

My friends are all straight and they're supportive but they don't understand. ""It's so easy to hookup with guys just do that"" they say...yeah it is easy but the 5-6 times I had sex with random people I hated myself afterwards. I'm wondering if maybe I should just try being fwb with somebody and hope it turns into something? I feel so lonely and even more so now that my friends/roommates have started dating people the past few months.

Additionally, I haven't been able to fully come out yet and it's starting to bother me. I tried telling my parents in August and they didn't believe me, which they told me is because I don't fit their stereotypical image and I had a girlfriend for 2 years back in highschool. I'm financially dependent on them while I'm in school and they withheld my rent check from me until I went to see a therapist (which I told them I did but then I didn't). In December they called my Primary Care Physician and told him to have a talk with me about my sexuality which he basically told me that they were being crazy and weren't ready to acknowledge it yet. The thing is that I'm OK putting up with my parents (well not 100% OK, we used to be really close and now I harbor a lot of anger towards them), but what really hurts is not being able to tell my sisters. I'm super close to my sisters and I know they would be really supportive of me but I can't tell them because I know that they will explode on my parents when they find out how they treated me (especially because they can relate to denial from my parents: one has bipolar disorder and attempted suicide 10 years ago and another has depression). I don't feel like I need to tell my sisters until I have to (like having a bf). It doesn't help that my parents want more grand-kids either.

As of yesterday (the situation I want to talk about), 3 people know, 2 of whom are gay. But I'll get to that...

**ANECDOTE**

A couple months ago, a sorority on campus was hosting a fundraising event. It was a trivia night, and many people were there, including myself and a group of friends. The sorority had a guy hosting the event and announcing the questions. This guy was not *that* feminine/flamboyant, but people were making subtle jokes about gay the host is. These came from my table, tables around me, and from other groups I overheard.

Fast forward to the following week. I'm talking to some guy on Grindr, and it turns out to be the host from the trivia night. We chatted for a while. He asked if I was out, and at the time I was not. I asked about him, and said only a few people knew he was gay. **I was surprised by this, and suddenly I felt so soo bad for this guy.** Here he is, not fully accepting of himself and trying to keep his ""secret""... but everyone can tell that he's gay anyway. :(

I didn't tell him about any of the talking I had heard at the trivia night.

**COMING OUT**

So as I mentioned earlier, I'm out to 3 people currently. The first guy I told was my straight best friend, and surprisingly he had the best reaction so far (""Ok. I won't tell anyone. How long have you known?""). 

The second person I told was one of the gay guys. I had taken him and some friends to the bars for his birthday the week before. He drunkenly told me I could ""tell him anything"" and he would ""always support me"". I started freaking out because I thought he knew my secret, somehow. Anyway, I told him a week later, and he was shocked. He said that he never thought I was into dudes, but was glad I was comfortable enough to tell him.

**YESTERDAY**

I was hanging out with a gay friend, smoking weed and listening to music. I go to the bathroom or go to get stuff from my bag or something, and when I get back he has his phone out. He says: ""I have a question.... How come you never told me you were gay!?!"" and shows me that my Tinder profile came up on his phone.

**He actually was very upset that we had been friends for so long and he never knew. This friend of mine has accurately pegged 4 mutual friends as being gay before they even came out or accepted it themselves.** And that's just in the time that I've known him; he claims to have been right about several other guys at school too. To me, all these guys seemed just as straight as the rest... I guess I can't tell unless they're really flamboyant.

**IDK. I'm getting this weird sense of pride that people aren't able to tell that I'm into dudes?** Like, I spent all these years trying to cover it up, and it has ""finally paid off"" because no one has a clue. Especially after seeing how people joked about the trivia night host. But... now I'm realizing that even other gay guys can't tell, which may make it hard to meet other guys.

But...I'm also starting to wish that maybe I was a bit more flamboyant or feminine acting? Then it would have been harder to be ""straight-acting"", and I probably would have come out back in high school, instead of trying to convince myself I was straight for 8 more years. I could have started seeing guys way earlier instead of just dipping my feet in the water now. IDK

**TL;DR:**

Dealing with weird feels after coming out and people telling me they thought I was straight. How do you guys react to the ""I would have never guessed!"" statements? Do they make you feel good? Bad?
","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a 22 year old college student, starting to come out as of last month. As of yesterday (the situation I want to talk about), 3 people know, 2 of whom are gay. But I&amp;#39;ll get to that...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ANECDOTE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple months ago, a sorority on campus was hosting a fundraising event. It was a trivia night, and many people were there, including myself and a group of friends. The sorority had a guy hosting the event and announcing the questions. This guy was not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; feminine/flamboyant, but people were making subtle jokes about gay the host is. These came from my table, tables around me, and from other groups I overheard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to the following week. I&amp;#39;m talking to some guy on Grindr, and it turns out to be the host from the trivia night. We chatted for a while. He asked if I was out, and at the time I was not. I asked about him, and said only a few people knew he was gay. &lt;strong&gt;I was surprised by this, and suddenly I felt so soo bad for this guy.&lt;/strong&gt; Here he is, not fully accepting of himself and trying to keep his &amp;quot;secret&amp;quot;... but everyone can tell that he&amp;#39;s gay anyway. :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t tell him about any of the talking I had heard at the trivia night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COMING OUT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So as I mentioned earlier, I&amp;#39;m out to 3 people currently. The first guy I told was my straight best friend, and surprisingly he had the best reaction so far (&amp;quot;Ok. I won&amp;#39;t tell anyone. How long have you known?&amp;quot;). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second person I told was one of the gay guys. I had taken him and some friends to the bars for his birthday the week before. He drunkenly told me I could &amp;quot;tell him anything&amp;quot; and he would &amp;quot;always support me&amp;quot;. I started freaking out because I thought he knew my secret, somehow. Anyway, I told him a week later, and he was shocked. He said that he never thought I was into dudes, but was glad I was comfortable enough to tell him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YESTERDAY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was hanging out with a gay friend, smoking weed and listening to music. I go to the bathroom or go to get stuff from my bag or something, and when I get back he has his phone out. He says: &amp;quot;I have a question.... How come you never told me you were gay!?!&amp;quot; and shows me that my Tinder profile came up on his phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He actually was very upset that we had been friends for so long and he never knew. This friend of mine has accurately pegged 4 mutual friends as being gay before they even came out or accepted it themselves.&lt;/strong&gt; And that&amp;#39;s just in the time that I&amp;#39;ve known him; he claims to have been right about several other guys at school too. To me, all these guys seemed just as straight as the rest... I guess I can&amp;#39;t tell unless they&amp;#39;re really flamboyant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IDK. I&amp;#39;m getting this weird sense of pride that people aren&amp;#39;t able to tell that I&amp;#39;m into dudes?&lt;/strong&gt; Like, I spent all these years trying to cover it up, and it has &amp;quot;finally paid off&amp;quot; because no one has a clue. Especially after seeing how people joked about the trivia night host. But... now I&amp;#39;m realizing that even other gay guys can&amp;#39;t tell, which may make it hard to meet other guys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But...I&amp;#39;m also starting to wish that maybe I was a bit more flamboyant or feminine acting?

It’s been a rough time since the break up. My therapist and I met again. We did some catching up and she went over the progress I’ve made since I first started seeing her and reminded me that being at a low point now has not undone all the progress of the last several years. She’s right. I haven’t touched the alcohol, or anything harder than that. A few years ago I would have been out getting smashed every night after a break up.

No rebound sex either, although that one wasn’t hard to resist. I feel completely numb to other men so far. I’m still hung up on this boy.

Then Tuesday he texts and asks to meet up. No details about why, just asking for a time and place. Last night we arrange a meeting at my apartment. I’m very, very hopeful that after some time to digest the bomb I dropped on him, he’s come around and ready to give me another try.

He starts by saying he’s really sorry about how he reacted before. He was shocked and had never known anyone in my position before. The videos he’d seen of me were disturbing. But he judged me too quickly and he still really liked me after all. He wants to give our relationship another chance.

I’m fucking over the moon. But I’m still cautious. I want him to be sure, and to think hard about what it means to be with me. Can he handle this long term, or will he bail when his pity for me wears off and the jealousy/anger/disgust sets in?

I ask how he feels about the porn. He said before he wanted a LTR and he couldn’t deal with it. What changed?

Nothing, he said. He just realized he was being judgmental and insecure now that he knows how many men I’ve fucked and how much more experienced I am.

Me: Do you still feel jealous and uncomfortable with videos of me online?

Him: Yes. But I’ll get over it.

Me: You realize there’s nothing I can do to get those videos taken down. They’re going to be there forever.

Him: can we just not mention it again? I won’t look at them again. 

Me: Do you still feel uncomfortable knowing I have been with a lot of men?

Him: Yeah. But as long as you don’t talk about it and don’t do anything to remind me of it, it should be ok.

Me: Can you still respect me, knowing what you do now?

Him: Of course I do. It’s just really hard to see you like that. (referring to the rougher/BDSM videos. From this, I believe he has indeed lost some respect for me.)

I can see that he’s trying so hard to be mature about this, but he really can’t deal with me and my history. He’s doing this out of affection, some sense of moral obligation, and guilt. The problems he has with my history are not resolved—he’s just trying to ignore them by taking me back. This will lead to resentment in the long term.

My heart is breaking all over again. This kid wants to be okay with my history. But he’s not. It’s clear as day.

We have a long talk and I explain all this to him. He can’t take me back. He’s not ok with my history and he’s allowed his preferences. But his preferences mean he would never be happy with me in the long run. I tell him there are plenty of healthier men who can give him what he wants. I’m not one of them.

We said goodbye and I watched him get into his car from my window. I saw him in the driver’s seat just sitting there and start crying. My protective instincts kicked in so I go out to the parking lot and get into the car with him and let him cry on me for a while.

I told him that he’s fucking gorgeous, sweet, and wicked smart and he could have any guy he wants who wouldn’t hurt him like me and my past would. Eventually he calmed down enough to drive, so we said goodbye for the last time and then I went back inside and broke down for a while.

I’m pretty gutted, and emotionally drained. But I don’t think I made a mistake. Better to end it now instead of venturing into a relationship in which this issue continues to build resentment and insecurity before ultimately breaking us apart. He deserves better than to be constantly tormented by this issue while dating me. I’ve seen guys get all sorts of insecurities when they find out what I used to do. It’s better he not have to deal with that.

I thought you guys would like an update. This sub has been tremendously supportive thus far. I have few outlets when I am emotionally distressed. My therapist is wonderful, but she is a professional and I am under no illusions that our relationship is a friendship. My friends are a bunch of straight gym rat meatheads who mean well but can’t relate to homo love affairs.

Thanks for listening gaybros.

Edit for grammar.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m 19 and I have recently come to terms with my sexuality. As a result I joined some gay apps in order to meet other gay/bi men. It seems like many, many white guys on these apps have some variation of &amp;quot;no blacks&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;white men only&amp;quot; but I&amp;#39;ve been getting hit up by these same guys. I could understand if I were a racially ambiguous looking black person but I&amp;#39;m quite clearly black. At first I would just ignore these guys but lately I&amp;#39;ve been asking &amp;quot;why are you hitting me up when your profile says no blacks?&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;ve gotten everything from apologies to guys editing their profile and claiming I must have them confuse to down right nasty, racist responses I won&amp;#39;t repeat.
