I know that probably sounds ridiculous to a lot of guys here, but growing up there were barely any fellow homosexuals around so the chances of losing my virginity, or experimenting in any way, were essentially nonexistent.

So last week, out of desperation, I started responding to ads on Craigslist just to experience... something. My first time was at a gloryhole, and I have to say it felt great to give and receive a blowjob. The only problem was that I couldn't come. I left that night excited about the escapade, but somewhat upset that I didn't finish.

This happened again two more times... most recently tonight. Granted, the guy who I was with this time was also inexperienced and teeth and stubble occasionally got in the way, but for the most part I'd say it felt good, and we were going at it for a while, but at one point I sort of got bored. I never felt like I was close to coming. I ended up feeling somewhat numb to the whole thing, despite being hard.

Thankfully all of these guys have been understanding about the fact that I couldn't come. They never shamed me, and the guy I saw tonight wants to see me again, but I've still got this aching feeling that there's something wrong with me. I can come perfectly fine when I masturbate, so I'm not sure if I'm just overwhelmed or over thinking it. Any thoughts or advice on the subject would be greatly appreciated.

---

Side note... I'm also not sure if I enjoy kissing. The couple of times I've tried it I was just so aware that there was a tongue in my mouth, which was fine, but overall it just felt perfunctory instead of magical. I'm broken, right?

She thought I was bi, but as time went on I realized I wasn't. I told her a few months ago. We slowly finished our planned events and have now parted ways. We tried being friends but we need distance for now. We are hoping in time we can resume being best friends again.

While we dated about 3 years ago I met this guy at college. We become best friends really fast. I didn't have a really close friend, only a couple friends and he quickly filled the gap. We get along great, he likes everything I like, our conversations are never dull. He's like a brother. I tried really hard to build a relationship with him, looking back I think maybe it was weird how much effort I put into it.

Even while dating my girlfriend we would talk and text throughout the day, everyday, and see each other a few times a week just us, or with our couple other guys we hang out with. 

I've had a crush on him the whole time I've known him. He's straight. He got a girlfriend last year and it hasn't effected us at all, I'm glad for that. She's really nice. I feel guilty that sometimes I feel like we know each other better than she knows him.

I've always just pushed it aside. I'm used to it, when we go swimming we change and shower in front of each other, etc. I admire his attractiveness, but I can handle it. We are pretty open with everything like that.

Since coming out and loosing the support of my gf, he's the only one that is truly right at my side and always making sure I'm OK and everything is fine for me. He's always making plans with me, always encouraging me to go out after work and on weekends with him or other people if he's busy to get my mind off things since I mop at home a lot and I'm so used to having her use up my time and I'm not used to people knowing I'm gay. I have other friends, but he's always been so much closer. He always checking up on me and wants to know how I'm doing and managing.

I do a lot for him too. It's not all one way, we have a great thing going between us.

I met another guy for the first time the other day and he phoned me after to make sure I made it home OK and everything went fine.

I never really thought a lot about it until now, but is this OK?

I cried last night because I'm scared our relationship is wrong to have. I'm scared its too much for me. I'm scared its leading me on or something or its 'too much' to be healthy for me to know a guy like this that doesn't want me sexually.

I mean the first thing I wanna do when I finished going out with another guy is to tell my friend about it. And after I go out with a guy, the next day I'll go out with him and another friend and spend the entire day together and sleep over playing video games.

I just feel weird knowing that my bond with him is always going to be this strong. Even while dating someone else.

I have a lot of time for a boyfriend, but despite that I'd want my relationship with my friend to stay this way for as long as we can.

Is this all OK? I feel fake knowing that I crush on him. Every time I see him now I get anxious that its wrong. Every time I go out with a guy I just think I'm cheating by knowing this friend.

He was DL and wanted to be more private so we get on KIK. We sext for a little bit, I send him a few photos (ex BF, no face k). He cums and so do I to this wonderful horny lie I've developed. After a while we just get to talking and this guy just opens up to me like crazy. Saying how repress he his, how lonley, total closet case. We bond over real stuff and stories just in a different character. 

I get to know this guy like no one before. He tells me he would go gay for me. He want to have little blond babies with me (he's blond). I feel like he needed someone be him self around. Not to sweeten the pot but my parents have some money(not a lot but enough) he knew my family accepts me gay and all and I did show him a few pics of my car (BMW no big deal). I felt like he just said what he said to sweeten me up but he felt so real and I so fake. He went in to say how him family is extremely religious (they have a church in town) and how he couldn't come out. I felt bad for him. He spoke with such sadness I couldn't bare the lie any longer. We had been talking for about 4 hours and I just couldn't bare to lie anymore. I did it. I told him who I was. And he flipped out. He said he was ""flabbergasted"" he couldn't believe I have constructed such a lie. But the truth is I didn't everything was real except the face. I know I'm a horrible person but it hurt still. I talked to him two days later after class. He just said we where ""neutral"".

The hardest part is that yo this day I think of him often. Knowing the cage he's in. The lie he has to live. He's a great guy. I bet. But no matter what happens he will NEVER trust me. I will never be his and he will never be mine. I could say I fell for him HARD.  It pains me. But that's that.

I know I&amp;#39;m a horrible person but it hurt still. I talked to him two days later after class. He just said we where &amp;quot;neutral&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hardest part is that yo this day I think of him often. Knowing the cage he&amp;#39;s in. The lie he has to live. He&amp;#39;s a great guy. I bet. But no matter what happens he will NEVER trust me. I will never be his and he will never be mine. I could say I fell for him HARD.  It pains me. But that&amp;#39;s that. &lt;/p&gt;

So a few months ago I posted about not having a great experience in college, if you are willing and interested in reading about it you can read about it [here.] (http://redd.it/2043hb) Things have mostly stayed the same (I will make another post about that), but I am not here for that now.

Before I go on, I must say that I came out to my cousin and she was very supportive. We had a very emotional moment and she is my only ally in the family. But what I am here for is something that happened with my mom and my sister about a month ago when my sister tried going through my phone.

So I basically yelled at her for doing so but maybe it was an overraction. She then turns the tables on me and asks ""why don't you ever let me use your electronic devices?"" ""What are you hiding?"" ""Who are you talking to, a guy, boyfriend?"" Then she said "" you better not come out with some gay shit just like X."" X is a family friend who came out to his parents and since we are Hispanic/Latino, it's a big deal as if a bomb exploded. Since my sister was speaking in Spanish, my mom understood everything and basically ganged up on me regarding this subject.

The next day I was on the toilet (tmi I know) with my tablet when my mom comes in to hang some clothes to air-dry in the bathroom. She asked me why I was always on my tablet and what was I doing all the time with it. I responded that I was reading some K-Pop articles. Since I basically love all things Asian, she responds in Spanish ""those Asian girls are driving you crazy or is it the Asian guys?"" ""Maybe your sister was right and you too might come out with some gay shit like X.  I was completely astonished by her comments that I just laughed and did not even say yes or no. She then left the bathroom and we haven't spoke about it since. But since then she is always suspicious when I receive a text and I walk away from her when I answer my texts. Unfortunately, I do not have a boyfriend and I am just responding normally to my texts. I never had a girlfriend before nor show interest in girls like other guys my age (I'm 23) either.

So bros, what do you think? Do they know, suspect? **Note: I accidentally bookmarked a gay porn once and my sister saw it and asked me about it. I basically lied through my teeth but idk if she bought it.""** What should I do? Should I confront my sister about why she made those comments or should I let it go since this matter has not been brought up again?

**tl;dr:**I slightly overracted when my sister was looking through my phone and she basically instigated about my phone conversations and sexuality. My mom heard this and she too questioned my sexuality in both instances in a negative tone. Do you think they know or suspect?

I prefer to be around guys based on their more relaxed behaviors. I don't generally feel sexual attraction in a sense of, ""oh that guy's really hot, I want that one in my bed, now!"" My attraction falls more so in, ""Whoa, he's handsome. Look at that smile, I want to make him laugh more."" Beyond that, the physical realm is irrelevant to me. So, to the point. Anytime I'm ever hanging out one-on-one with a gay guy who IS sexual, it always ends badly with me being called a 'tease'. For examples: A guy I had gotten to know at my workplace over a year ago. We went for a few beer one night. We got along great. I like to get a little rough. Wrestled around a bit when we're walking. The only things I said to him that night about physical aspects were that he looked great in the shirt he was wearing. There was no talk of sex. I left to go home at the end of the night and he followed, then he kissed me. I just pulled back and told him I had to go, he followed and tried again, I did the same again. Then he...got aggressive. I stopped his advances and he said, ""Well if you didn't want it to happen you shouldn't be such a tease!"" Flash forward to a few months later with my best friend. Also a sexual gay guy. We were always hanging out and he knew I had no sexual attractions. However in his room one night, he started making moves on me. I told him I wasn't into him like that. He continued stating that, ""Maybe you just have a low libido, just give it a try and maybe you'll like it."" I told him no, but he kept trying so I left. Now more recently, I went out with a guy two nights ago. We grabbed a bite to eat and had a couple of beer. I left to go home as it was getting late, he followed and suggested we share a cab. I was cool with that, my house was closer, so it was the first stop. He hopped out and asked if he could come in. I made it apparent that I was hesitant as I wanted to go to sleep. He suggested just for a few minutes. I agreed, he came in, and what do ya know? He makes advances. I literally facepalm him and say, ""Not going to happen"". He got upset and stated, ""Well what was this night all about then if this isn't what you want? Don't waste people's time."" So basically, I need to know, am I being a tease by hanging out one-on-one with gay guys and giving them a compliment here and there?

I'm 17 and based in a small rural area in the North of England, I think I've known that I'm gay for a couple of years now, but I seemed to have suppressed my sexuality and not acknowledged it until about 6 months ago when I accepted it.I had been watching gay porn for god knows how long but insisted and told myself I was straight (seems mental, right?). 
I think I suppressed it because I was teased for being gay by my friends when I was about 14, and at the time I didn't realise that they were actually right, which is ironic, but hey ho time has passed and we're all mates again now.
I'm currently at a small sixth form which is joined to a lower school so the age range is 11-18. It's a small school but I have quite a lot of friends there - it's ok - but I don't think that there has ever been an openly gay person there... ever. Probably because of the fact that the lower school would be very immature about it (and even some of the older school too). 

Now, to seeming make matters worse for me I am from a farming background and have loads of farmer friends who I really like, but they're not the most open minded people in the world and I would assume that most of them have never even met a gay person in their life, so they base their opinions of gay people on all of the stereotypes...

I think that my family would be accepting (they're pretty great actually, so in that respect I'm very lucky) but I feel like some of my friends wouldn't be mature or open minded enough to be normal with me if I came out. 

I haven't told anyone, but have sneaking suspicions that some people already know, especially my immediate family, but no one has confronted me about it. After accepting myself for who I am some months ago, I have been generally happier, and seem to be hiding my true personality less than before, but I still feel trapped.

I intend to go to University, I like the sound of Manchester and Canal Street which are famous for being accepting of anyone and everyone. Should I wait until then, or come out now because I feel like I can't be myself until I do, is it worth the ridicule?
","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about doing this for a while, so here goes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m 17 and based in a small rural area in the North of England, I think I&amp;#39;ve known that I&amp;#39;m gay for a couple of years now, but I seemed to have suppressed my sexuality and not acknowledged it until about 6 months ago when I accepted it.I had been watching gay porn for god knows how long but insisted and told myself I was straight (seems mental, right?). 
I think I suppressed it because I was teased for being gay by my friends when I was about 14, and at the time I didn&amp;#39;t realise that they were actually right, which is ironic, but hey ho time has passed and we&amp;#39;re all mates again now.
I&amp;#39;m currently at a small sixth form which is joined to a lower school so the age range is 11-18. It&amp;#39;s a small school but I have quite a lot of friends there - it&amp;#39;s ok - but I don&amp;#39;t think that there has ever been an openly gay person there... ever. Probably because of the fact that the lower school would be very immature about it (and even some of the older school too). &lt;/p&gt;
