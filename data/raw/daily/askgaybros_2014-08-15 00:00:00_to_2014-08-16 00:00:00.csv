So I just got into a new university and out of a long term relationship in the beginning of the summer.

As soon as I sensed it I talked to him about it, told him that I really do like him, but what I said at the beginning was still true. He said he understands, but still enjoys spending time with me. 

I'm leaving in a few days for school which is on the other side of the state. My grandparents say they will take me, but the guy I've been seeing also offered to take me. He is an alumni of my school and says he would be happy to take me. So what I'm wondering is if taking him up on it would it be too much, or am I just overthinking it? I can tell hegenuinely wants to hang out for a few hours before I go, and I would like to spend time with him as well. I'm just wondering if it would be unfair to him.

The block system that allowed most of us to finish homework at school. The education is great even though it has so much freedom, my brother is going to a major university after graduating from said public school.

Now i have 7 periods, and each teacher feels they should give fking homework, what the fuck! I sat alone at lunch today, yup here we go again. Miserable existence for the next two years of highschool.

Not to mention that everyone segregates themselves, i don't fit in with the black kids or the white kids. At public school everyone just sat wherever they wanted with whoever and no one felt the need to group together into retarded cliques.

Fuck school, i don't know why i'm ever optimistic about these things. I should have went in expecting worse. 

I also have to drive to school now, i got lost on the way home, almost got into two accidents trying to work the GPS on my phone.

Yea, so i guess this was suppose to be about how to be motivated to do my homework.. I already know the answer though, my future, college, shit like that.

My sophomore year in college I was really good friends with this freshman guy, like he one of the best bros I've ever had.  Literally hanging out with each other every day.  About six months into our friendship (which seemed like forever in college weeks), I happened to go on a date with another guy who tells me that my friend blew him in high school, and for some reason I thought it was my duty to get my friend to open up to me about his past and talk through whatever issues he was dealing with.  After all, I had come to college in the closet and felt liberated when I realized there was nothing to fear, and I assumed he would see it that way too.  I had also begun to notice the way he acted towards certain straight guys, and, as a friend, I most certainly did not want him to go down that road of terror.  

So I brought it up through text message one weekend while I was drunk and he was back at home and...well....yeah that didn't work out.  He immediately stopped talking to me and hasn't looked back.  A week after he removed me from his life, he made new friends (including one of the straight guys he had a crush on) who then harassed me for 1) being gay and 2) being in love with him-- which was not true at all.  Some angry texts and on-campus graffiti escalated our fight before I went to the student life counselor and had intervene and stop the harassment.  

I learned afterwards, from his de facto fag-hag back home that he was chastised in HS when people found out, as he comes from a small, bible-belt community.  He had also come out to her, and only her, so I knew I wasn't being lied to by the guy I went on the date with.

That was three years ago, and I've felt like shit about the whole situation ever since.  My feelings of vomiting and regret come and go every few months, but this summer has been particularly bad as he has become extremely active and visible within the college orientation scene.  I don't know what to do.  I was fine when he was out of my mind and I didn't think about the situation, but it feels like this time I’m going to feel like shit for a lot longer.  I know talking to him is completely out of the question, as we have both nearly completed our college lives and have taken wildly separate paths than we had planned to take when we were friends.  I'm just sick of beating myself up for being a pushy jerk to him in the first place, even though he is probably better off where he is now.

TL;DR- Three years ago found out a close friend was gay, asked him about it, he cuts off contact and makes new friends, his friends escalated and turned rude fast, I've felt like shit every now and then since, this wave feels almost as bad as it did after it happened.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about something that happened three years ago a lot recently for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;
