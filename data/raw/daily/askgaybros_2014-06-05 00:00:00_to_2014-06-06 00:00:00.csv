I don't really watch much porn as my sex drive isn't wild and my sex life has always been fulfilling enough that I rarely masturbate…anyway, we've been seeing each other for almost six months and although we are ""openish"" this still came as a shocker. But I didn't really care because I really like him/am falling for him and I kind of understand. I actually was wondering how he was paying for college because I know he grew up poor and have met his parents who are sweet but you could tell they don't come from much (doesn't matter to me though). He's attractive and hung…and regular jobs just can't give you thousands of dollars for a day's worth of work.  
  
He says this is just until he graduates (debt-free too…better than I'm doing lol) and…it's okay with me. Anyway, I'm not jealous about him sleeping with other guys. Okay, I found out he wanted to be openish because of his career so he didn't technically lie to me. But he says he didn't fool around with anyone else outside of work and actually I never took advantage of our open relationship. He's actually the only guy I've ever slept with.  
  
Now here's the kicker…first comes my pride and second health. He fucks **porn stars**. I have a small penis and am fit (think Josh Hutcherson kind of body) but no way near being a model or a porn star…like…I'm scared because physically he could do better…and *does* do better. He fucks other super hung, muscly men. I never felt self-conscious about this because  I'm mostly confident, but the reality is that ""porn is just fantasy"" isn't true. Porn stars are real people and really look like that…my boyfriend is one of them and fucks many of them…this is scary to me! Should I talk to him about this? I want to bring it up but I don't want him to think I'm a clingy, jealous crazy. Why does he come home to me every night when he can and does fuck perfect men? How can he see me naked and fuck me and look at my body without thinking ""meh, I can do better""?  
  
Now…the second concern is health. I looked at his vids and he does only bareback porn. We only use condoms so I'm not too concerned and he said his company is crazy rigid with health/testing guidelines, but it's the other guys he fucks I don't completely trust with their health. I told him we aren't barebacking until he is done with porn and he said he didn't want otherwise…so I was considering getting PreP (is that the right thing?). Anyone have experience with this?  
  
Oh, and one final thing. The company labeled him as straight and in his interviews he talks about girls he fucks and how much he loves playing football. It's hilarious because he's never fucked a girl and the only sport he's good at is twerking to Beyonce's Partition…thought I'd just share that funny tidbit.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the funny thing is that I&amp;#39;m sure you&amp;#39;ve jerked off to him before.

So this is a really gross question to be asking on here but don't really want to ask anyone I know about this non threatening problem. Am just after other guys thoughts on the matter. I know I shouldn't take medical advice from here but am just after some opinions.

Anyway, so you know how generally guys buttholes are sort of puckered closed and then open up when the muscle relaxes. Well mine seems to permanently open a little bit. When I look in the mirror it is not really puckered up and there is just constantly a small hole unless I sort of pucker it with my muscle. Even then it is not fully closed like you would see in porn etc. This worries me quite a bit as I don't want to have a loose ass. I have never bottomed before or even put anything up there so not sure why it is like that.

Older, white, lonely men love me. And here's the truth I know. They were the guys thinking they could always do better, but they get older and realize they aren't top dog anymore…they go for the younger, pretty, white guys and they aren't getting love from them like they used to. So they come to us. They come to *me*. And it's because they know how hard us minorities in the gay dating world have it. Even most minorities want white men…and 99% of white men want white men only…and we are a flavor of the month. We aren't your boyfriends or the dream man you think about. Not the guy who you want to bring home to your parents. We're the guy you google or find on grindr because you want something a little different just for a night. And it's not *us* you want, but the stereotype.  
  
Most gay minorities will just complain and cry…but not me. I've taken full advantage of this. Some older, white men have money. Lots and lots of money. I liked this and I welcomed it. Things for a gay minority are tough, but not as tough as it could be. Older, powerful men paying your rent, buying you cars, wiring thousands into your bank account, paying for your education…why would I complain?  
  
But now I look at my life…at who I am…and I see myself as nothing more than a prostitute with a masters degree. I've had plenty of good sex, but I've never been in love. I'm 28 now…and have been with closeted, wealthy men, you know…but I know they've never loved me. I've been a brief love affair away from their wives and I've been a night out at the Chinese restaurant instead of the usual Italian place these guys go to.  
  
I don't like myself…but the addiction to using white men for their money and gifts is just so intoxicating. It feels like I'm getting back at the way you've made me feel. Made us all feel. I know you're not all racist and are good people, but I had to stop taking the abuse from the white gay community and decided to use you for every last dime you have.  
  
And now I've lost myself…","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a racial minority, I was kind of sick of this obvious yet unspoken sentiment that no matter how hot or fit or successful I am that I had to be twice as good as the average white guy just to be on par with him…but I&amp;#39;ve used one thing to my advantage. Older, white, lonely men love me. And here&amp;#39;s the truth I know. They were the guys thinking they could always do better, but they get older and realize they aren&amp;#39;t top dog anymore…they go for the younger, pretty, white guys and they aren&amp;#39;t getting love from them like they used to. So they come to us. They come to &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;. And it&amp;#39;s because they know how hard us minorities in the gay dating world have it. Even most minorities want white men…and 99% of white men want white men only…and we are a flavor of the month. We aren&amp;#39;t your boyfriends or the dream man you think about. Not the guy who you want to bring home to your parents. We&amp;#39;re the guy you google or find on grindr because you want something a little different just for a night. And it&amp;#39;s not &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt; you want, but the stereotype.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most gay minorities will just complain and cry…but not me. I&amp;#39;ve taken full advantage of this. Some older, white men have money. Lots and lots of money. I liked this and I welcomed it. Things for a gay minority are tough, but not as tough as it could be. Older, powerful men paying your rent, buying you cars, wiring thousands into your bank account, paying for your education…why would I complain?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now I look at my life…at who I am…and I see myself as nothing more than a prostitute with a masters degree. I&amp;#39;ve had plenty of good sex, but I&amp;#39;ve never been in love. I&amp;#39;m 28 now…and have been with closeted, wealthy men, you know…but I know they&amp;#39;ve never loved me. I&amp;#39;ve been a brief love affair away from their wives and I&amp;#39;ve been a night out at the Chinese restaurant instead of the usual Italian place these guys go to.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t like myself…but the addiction to using white men for their money and gifts is just so intoxicating. It feels like I&amp;#39;m getting back at the way you&amp;#39;ve made me feel. Made us all feel. I know you&amp;#39;re not all racist and are good people, but I had to stop taking the abuse from the white gay community and decided to use you for every last dime you have.  &lt;/p&gt;

I'm writing this out of desperation. I have spent the last week just crying, every morning, every night. I don't want to be gay.

I'm 18, in my senior year of high school. I get high grades and have been recognized as on of the top football (American) recruits in Canada. Iv'e known I have been gay for a while its just really hit me that I don't know where to go from here.

I am so ashamed of being gay. I live in fear everyday because of it. I would not be able to handle anyone finding out about this secret I have kept for so long. I am extremely self-conscious. I went though a whole year where I couldn't look in a mirror. The anxiety killed me, lived everyday worried about how I was perceived. I am afraid those feelings would resurface if I were to ever come out. I will become paranoid again. I just can't have people stereotyping me, just thinking I like to screw dudes. I'm so fucking ashamed of this very fact. But this isn't just where my problems lie.

I just feel so hopeless when it comes to finding someone. I feel like I'm attracted to such a small percentage of gay men. I only feel attracted to men that mirror myself. Ones that don't fit in with the gay community. Quite honestly I hate everything that has to do with being gay, the femmes, the sex, the drugs, the lifestyle. And I hate stereo-types, absolutely hate them. I'm so uncomfortable being around gay people that act gay. I'm fucking sick and tired of people saying they're masc, when I don't think I have ever found one that truly is. I'm just so fucking lonely. All I've wanted for so long is for someone to love me as much as I love them.

I met a guy named Drew at the beginning of this year. I really liked him and put my heart out there and it got fucking chucked to the curb. And I fucking miss him so much. He made me believe that there were gays out there that were different, guess it wasn't the case. He just wanted me for sex. We even committed to a relationship but not soon after he just stopped talking to me cold turkey. Someone said they saw him as I was walking around during pride just this last weekend (1st time at pride was terrified the whole time)  and I fucking lost it. I had hope I thought I could actually do this but it was just a fucking reality check that everyone is just here to get off and I'm just their device. I just provide the pictures on Grindr, or put out  and never hear from them again.

I've just always spent my whole life going through things myself. Never depending on other people. I don't even have a best friend for fuck sake. I don't have any close friends. People always say I have everything going for me but they have no fucking idea what lies underneath the surface. If I were to even confide in one person I could never trust anyone to do so. I have no one I could trust to keep such a secret. 

The thing is I can't be out when I go to university. Playing University football while out would be a nightmare for me. If they found out how could I show my face in the showers? I could kiss everything I have worked for goodbye. People think homophobia is a thing of the past but trust me roots still flow strong in many sports especially football. I have done everything for my sport, its my passion. For so long I just focused on football. Ignored everything else. Didn't make friends, just played football. Just it's not working anymore. I'm so fucking terrified I'll have to give up the one thing I am passionate about because of it. My reputation, my athletic accomplishments. I'm just so scared.

I don't look forward to the future at all. I want kids, something ill never have, how am I supposed to do it if I'm gay? How can I confront my parents and bring a boy home for thanksgiving. I just don't want to live like that, everything seems so fucking shitty if you're gay. I am just so hopeless. I have no where else to turn.

EDIT:
Look, I didn't mean to offend anyone. Ill agree I am ignorant about all of this. I have really had no one to talk to all of this about. I was really emotional while writing this post. If you got to know me I'm not an asshole, I'm just scared. I hide behind other things to distract what I really feel. I don't think any different of any lgbtq, I can understand how it came off. I'm sorry that I'm naive, I'm young, I'm an asshole, I'm conceited. I know I'm weak, I'm a coward. I just expressed what was going through my head. I already knew it was fucked up. Thanks for the reminder.

My dearest friend learned a few years ago that her deceased grandfather, a guy she loved a lot until he died when she was 8, owned the Everard Baths in Chelsea. It was one of the most notorious gay baths in New York in the 60s-70s. 

Her family didn't keep a single piece of memorabilia from the baths or lounge, and she told me months ago that she wishes she had an artifact of the place.

She turns 30 on July 1 and I'd *love* to find her an original item from the Everard baths or lounge with the logo embroidered, printed, engraved, stamped, painted, or frosted onto it. Even neat photographs would bring her joy, and that's something she really deserves. 

If you know where I can find a special old piece of Everard history, please comment or PM. I deal in antiques and retro objects, and love to barter. And let me know of other places to search, subreddits to post to, and people to ask. If you visited the Everard in its heyday and have a story, memories, observations, or any other info to share, please get in touch. My friend knows nothing about the baths aside from the few watered-down facts her parents have recently told her. She wants to know the cool, fun, funny, dirty, sketchy, scary, and werid. Thanks!




**Background on the Everard Baths**

My friend grew up in Chelsea, NY in the 80s/90s. Her grandparents were loud, fun, and sometimes intimidating personalities about whose professional lives she knew little around the age of 8 when they died. In her early 20s one of her parents casually mentioned that her grandpa had owned one of New York's biggest gay bath houses, the Everard Baths (can you guess the nickname?), right near where she grew up in Chelsea. My friend had naively thought/was subtly misinformed that he owned some fancy restaurant, I think. 

Her grandfather was a larger-than-life character, she says. An unpredictable drunk, hopeless gambler, and owner of one of the most popular gay baths in New York City (all things she learned later, though his drunkenness was never a secret). He ran the place from the 50s or 60s until Ed Koch shut the city's bath houses down in 1986 as part of a gay-targeted AIDS prevention campaign. 

He was the son of Jewish immigrants and bought what was a decrepit Turkish bath house. My friend said that from what she's been able to gather, it was always an unspoken fact that a portion of the bath hluse's clientele was there to get off, but the place catered to a predominately straight Turkish customers at first. It explode as a gay hotspot after he'd owned the place for a while, I believe in the early 70s. His attitude was one of gratitude for the business, and he began to cater to the needs of an expressly  gay clientele.

 In the 70s he began booking acts like Bette Midler to perform, and the baths reached their peak. Business slowed in light of the early AIDS epidemic and the Everard was forced to close in 1986 by city mayor Ed Koch who targeted many bath houses as part of sweeping Reagan-era policies. 

This broke his heart, my friend said. The business was his life. Though he lived unhealthily he was a great grandfather. I recently helped her in rack some outdated video file of camcorder footage from the early 90s showing her and both grandparents, each one a vibrant personality talking over the other. My friend wept.

My friend knows nothing about the baths aside from the few watered-down facts her parents have recently told her. She wants to know the cool, fun, funny, dirty, sketchy, scary, and werid. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background on the Everard Baths&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friend grew up in Chelsea, NY in the 80s/90s. Her grandparents were loud, fun, and sometimes intimidating personalities about whose professional lives she knew little around the age of 8 when they died. In her early 20s one of her parents casually mentioned that her grandpa had owned one of New York&amp;#39;s biggest gay bath houses, the Everard Baths (can you guess the nickname?), right near where she grew up in Chelsea. My friend had naively thought/was subtly misinformed that he owned some fancy restaurant, I think. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her grandfather was a larger-than-life character, she says. An unpredictable drunk, hopeless gambler, and owner of one of the most popular gay baths in New York City (all things she learned later, though his drunkenness was never a secret). He ran the place from the 50s or 60s until Ed Koch shut the city&amp;#39;s bath houses down in 1986 as part of a gay-targeted AIDS prevention campaign. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was the son of Jewish immigrants and bought what was a decrepit Turkish bath house. My friend said that from what she&amp;#39;s been able to gather, it was always an unspoken fact that a portion of the bath hluse&amp;#39;s clientele was there to get off, but the place catered to a predominately straight Turkish customers at first. It explode as a gay hotspot after he&amp;#39;d owned the place for a while, I believe in the early 70s. His attitude was one of gratitude for the business, and he began to cater to the needs of an expressly  gay clientele.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 70s he began booking acts like Bette Midler to perform, and the baths reached their peak. Business slowed in light of the early AIDS epidemic and the Everard was forced to close in 1986 by city mayor Ed Koch who targeted many bath houses as part of sweeping Reagan-era policies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This broke his heart, my friend said. The business was his life. Though he lived unhealthily he was a great grandfather. I recently helped her in rack some outdated video file of camcorder footage from the early 90s showing her and both grandparents, each one a vibrant personality talking over the other. My friend wept. &lt;/p&gt;

Im only 17 years old, and usually i dont think about stuff like this. But ive been putting myself down alot and im not sure why. It seems that in the gay community especially, there are a lot of shallow people, from size queens to the drug heads, to the ones obsessed with certain body types and only fuck bears/twinks.

On top of that im mixed, and from my experience ive found that the majority of people find white people to be more attractive. So with all of that stuff already in mind i feel as if im not good enough or that i dont have a place in this community to actually find somebody who cares about me as more than just an object for sex.

But then, with all of that in my head, i look at my reflection and i just think about how most people would find me unattractive. Its not that i care if everybody finds me attractive, its that i myself dont find myself attractive at all. 

Ive been called cute before and stuff but its always from guys who arent my type or arent very attractive themselves, so then i feel as if their judgment of beauty is skewed just because they find me more attractive than themselves.

In other words, yeah, i dont know how to get over this. Advice from other ugly people or people who arent really shallow? If anybody likes i can post pics for reference because i really need some type of confidence boost right now &gt;.&gt;

EDIT: For pics.

Got Grindr last night to check out my community, and people are lining up to suck my dick now. Who would have thought?

I don't know the guy, so what risks am I running in terms of him sucking my cock (with potentially him swallowing) and him rimming me. Any STDs, STIs, any other nasty stuff? I'm clean cuz I'm a virgin :/

Thanks bros. I wanna have fun but staying safe is more important to me. Also if I get something visible like a cold sore, that's a no no as I still love with parents and that would raise too many questions  ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi y&amp;#39;all&lt;/p&gt;

I'm in my mid-twenties and have been out to everyone since my teens. I always told myself I'd never date anyone who was in the closet because it would be too difficult for me to have to be secretive. I was introduced to this awesome guy recently who I've fallen completely head over heels for ... But there's just one catch, he's essentially semi-closeted. He's been out to his family for a few years now but still holds a lot of anxiety when it comes to being openly gay. A select number of his friends know, but he has trouble in general coming out to people. He fears they will see him differently yadda yadda yadda ... we know the feeling. 

Now I said id never be able to date someone in the closet, but this situation is really challenging me. He has not outright said no to slowly telling more people, and even said to me that he wanted to tell people about me. My friends and my better judgment tell me to give him a bit of time (it's only been a few weeks, after all), to see if he becomes comfortable enough to tell people. It's really difficult for me to let go and just enjoy spending time with him though, because I feel there's this cloud hanging over us. 

Have any of you guys ever dated a semi-closeted guy and given him a bit of time to get his shit together? How did it workout? Were you able to just relax, enjoy spending time with him, and give him some space? I really like this guy and, having had my fair share of relationships up to this point in my life, I feel like this guy is worth giving a chance to. 

TL;DR Have you dated a guy who's been out of the closet but not openly gay, and who's been anxious about telling people about your relationship? What was your experience?
