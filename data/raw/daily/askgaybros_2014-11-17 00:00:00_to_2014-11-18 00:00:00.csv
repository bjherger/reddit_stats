So I kinda just started dating since I only came out a few months ago and before that I just mostly kept to myself.  
I initially downloaded Grindr but since I am more interested in dating than hooking up, I switched to using Tinder.

The problem I'm having right now is that I really don't have much experience dating. The few dates I have gone on are with people I already knew pretty well. I've never gone on a date with someone I met online. I just really don't know how to act when I see this guy in person... What is normal? A handshake? A hug? A wave?

I really appreciated everyone who responded and i was hoping anyone who could offer me any advice would help out.


to sum up my previous post -

I got hurt at work, was attending physcial therapy, had a couple appointments with a woman who after she found out i was gay said a lot of hateful things that took me a long time to process. she told me that she believed marriage was between a man and a woman and that two men wouldn't be able to provide love to a child. she said a LOT of things over our 40 minute appointment that were really really hateful about my morality and how she couldn't understand how i could go against gods law and I just sat there trying to defend myself occasionally but mostly just sitting there and taking it.


I DID end up reporting her through an online form to the department of state, i also met with the acting supervisor at the facility at the time but this coming week I have to do a lot more. the actual supervisory doctor of the facility (i dont know how these places work!!) was on vacation and I have a meeting with her tuesday. on monday i have to call another person who i guess administers over regional staff or whatever who was also on vacation when it happened. 

while i was waiting to meet with the acting supervisor though she approached me and stood in front of me and tried to confront me again and i had to explicitly tell her to please leave three full times before she finally said that this was a ""public space"" and i had to stand up and walk away from her and turn my back to her in the office until she finally left and i was shaking really bad and it made me feel really uncomfortable 


I know that no one can really tell me anything i dont know i guess but I have been having a great deal of trouble sleeping and i cant seem to take my mind off of it unless i am actively distracting myself. i have been a complete wreck over the past week just worrying about everything that i have to say to these different people and trying to remember all the things that she said to me. Ill think im okay for most of the day but then it will just completely take over my thoughts and ill just think and think and think about it and it is making me feel awful all of the time


i know that i need to just put it out of my mind but if i stay up an entire night again im going to go crazy :( my stomach has been gnawing at me and i cant stop thinking about everything and i know its stupid but what she said was really hateful and i cant put it out of my head. Im glad i reported her and am going through this process but it is driving me crazy. over the past week i have only slept two or three hours at most a day because i cant relax any more and i cant stop thinking about it every time i lie down and am alone with my thoughts and ill try to relax and be okay for a little while and then it will just come flooding back and i feel like theres no way i can stop it


i dont know what to do because it is making me feel sick and i have talked to my husband about it so much and i know it wont do any good to just keep focusing on it but in my own mind i cant stop running through all these horrible conversations in my head and it is filling me with so much negativity. it has been a long time since i have felt negativity like this and i cant take it because it is ruining my life and i dont know if it is just because i am out of work from my injury but i cant put my mind off of it especially when i sleep. i just dont know what to do anymore.


I know it is completely pointless to post on here but i cant keep dealing with it alone i dont want to be alone and i dont know what to do to put it out of my mind and i dont want to distract myself anymore and i am just hoping that after i talk to the other people that i have to report her to that i can put it behind me, ive always had some social anxiety but ive never felt like this before and i just always feel kind of panicked about everything and i cant stop thinking unless i distract myself and im tired.

Since then he's avoided me. I try to make plans and he suggests other people for me to hang out - people I told before him which feels like some passive aggressive bullshit.

I've been dating this guy for a couple weeks now. We've been on probably 5 or so dates, and it's been nice. He said, and I quote: ""I like where this is heading. Due to past experiences, I just want to make sure we take things nice and slow :) no need to rush anything"".  Okay, I get that. Cool, I can do slow. But this is getting a bit discouraging... lemme explain:

He takes ridiculously long to respond to texts. Not a big deal typically, but it's gotten to the point where plans fall through because he doesn't respond. For example, we planned on going to a bar together last Thursday. He finished dinner with a friend at nine, texted me that he's done with dinner, and I responded ""Cool. Should I head over to your place?"" An hour later he finally responds apologizing for taking so long cause he didn't check his phone, saying that he's pregaming at another friends place. I say it's fine, and ask what he wants me to do. Mind you it was already 10:00pm at this point too. After I ask him what the plan is, no response. Not until 11:30 the next morning. He texts me saying he's really sorry, and that his phone died. Okay... well I believed him, but my roommate didn't at all. And he makes sense I guess. He said that if you know you're phones low on battery and you're texting someone plans, then any person in their right mind would text that person before the phone dies letting them know. And I guess it got me thinking. On one hand, he's told me he really likes spending time with me, outwardly tries to get together for dates, and says he likes where it's going. On the other hand, he's the slowest communicator in the world.

It's really irking me. What should I do?

I am 21 (M) and at college and, although I've always known I was bicurious, I never had any overwhelming urge to act on it as I usually find girls do it all for me. So I'm not out to any of my friends. 

However about a week ago, all my friends and I all went to a big party (something we do very regularly) and got very drunk (again something very common) and once everything was winding down, we all went back to our house. Due to one of our housemates having friends from another college staying, my best bro (who to my knowledge is completely straight) and I had agreed to share his bed to make room for the guests. (not unusual, occasionally passout together after a lot of drink, always platonic and fine).

We were absolutely smashed and he started spooning me, which I didnt think anything of, due to my drunkness. Then started kissing my neck and shoulders. I rolled over and he kissed me on the lips. 

About three to five minutes of making out ensues and then we just roll over and go to sleep.

Nothing has been mentioned of this since, but I am starting to... not necessarily develop feelings for him, but I want this to happen more / maybe go further.

How do I approach this issue with him, without risking losing him as my best friend / it becoming awkward? Maybe wait until we're both drunk, to let conversation flow and not get awkward?

Thanks in advance.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi, throwaway as friend almost definitely uses reddit.&lt;/p&gt;

I was out of town for work, left Friday morning and came back Saturday night. My boyfriend stayed home and went to his hometown about an hour and a half away. We texted throughout my trip.

 Saturday on my way back he says he's on his way home as well. I don't hear from him for a couple of hours and I got home and he wasn't there. Eventually he made contact saying he was staying another night via text. I tried calling and didn't get an answer. About 30 minutes later he finally calls back saying his phone was charging in the car. We talk and I make sure everything is ok.

This morning he texts me at 8:54 a.m. saying he is on his way home. I have heard not a single peep from him since, it is now 5:30 p.m. I've been through every stage of grief imaginable. The roads outside are horrible and are only getting worse as time goes on.

 I called DPS to see if his car or his name had been involved in an accident, nothing. Called all the hospitals in the area, nothing. Got in touch with his mom who I was under the impression he was going to see, nothing. I don't know what to do. Just sitting here twiddling my thumbs is killing me. 

**Update as of 10 a.m. Monday:**  Still nothing. Not a word, not a text, nothing. I went through some of his stuff, including his safe, he still has all his meds in there as well as his social security card. I have no idea what to do.
**Update as of 1:30 p.m. Monday:**  I have heard no word from anyone. He's supposed to work at 5:30 p.m. tonight. So I will at least check if his car is there later. I'm down to two choices if he shows up from what is likely a drug binge. Attempt to help him through it or kick him out. I'm prepping for both. Any advice is appreciated.

**Update as of 5:30 p.m. Monday:**  Still no word what so ever. After talking it over with several people with prior experience with this sort of thing, I'm deciding to move on. It seems almost a certainty that he went off on a binge. I don't know what else to do. Even if he comes back, he no longer has my trust. Best case scenario that I'm willing to endure is tell him he has to get his life fixed, but not while living in my house. Worst case, I cut off all contact. A friend is on his way over and we are going to box up his stuff.

**Update as of 11:55 p.m. Monday:**  I've texted him that his stuff is boxed up. Still no answer. I've talked to his family, they understand entirely. He did not show up to work. Am I still worried about him yes. But can I do anything to help him? No. I don't think so. I'll be ok. Thank you for all the thoughts and well wishes.

To save you the long background gory details-
-Bi guy (me) befriends straight guy a few years ago
 -Bi guy gradually develops crush on straight guy
 -Both work the same summer job. Bi guy's feelings get in the way of things and crush realizes the problem.
 -Bi guy can't control feelings appropriately, straight friend can't take it anymore and cuts bi guy out of his life.

I have not seen him since the middle of August. I tried to make things right and restore the friendship, but he cut me out of all contact. Blocked me on all social media, wouldn't respond to my texts until last month he told me to just leave him alone and nothing can ever be fixed. I did not do anything physically inappropriate to him, just acted upset and jealous, not saying that's right either. I know I screwed things up and should have appreciated the friendship, but part of me realizes that if he was a true friend he would have tried to work this out and help me. Even when he knew how I felt, he just got dismissive and didn't want to talk about it.

So now there is a reunion coming up in December that I found out he is going to. He does not know that I am going, but I haven't made my decision yet. There are other people at this job that I'm friendly with, but don't know anything that happened between me and him (to my knowledge). First I'm debating if I should go or not. I'd be afraid to make things really awkward given the situation. He told me the last time I tried to contact him to leave him alone and to stop talking to him, so I do not plan to approach him. But when we are in the same room, I am going to be really nervous as to what he will say or if I will have to end up speaking to him for any reason.

Okay , so I'm 23 And my best friend ( a guy ) is 24 and we have been best friends for 17 years now and I think I love him

I am out to everyone , and he was the first person I told and I admit I was scared because I taught he would look at me like a freak but he just said ""there's nothing wrong in being gay, we're still going to be as close as ever"", that statement made me so happy to know that he accepts me for who I am

So Last 3 Weeks I had a party (parents were not home) and he was So drunk and It was around 2am and I knew that he was in no condition to drive . After everyone had gone home, I took him to my room , so that he could sleep.  he put his leg over mine and cuddled with me, although that didn't seem weird at all because we do stuffs like that normally so it was no big deal , he then kissed my cheek and began stroking my **** , I was enjoying it (I won't deny that😉) and he said ""you know you're very attractive"", I blushed and I said thanks and well he just slept off, i felt like kissing him while he was sleeping but i decided not to

The next day , he woke up normally (no hangovers , i was surprised), i felt like asking him if he remembered yesterday night and he quickly replied with a ""no"" and he took his shower and went home

He Just got a new girlfriend and she is beautiful and sweet but I get so jealous when I see them together and when he talked about her, 
I love him a lot and I just want to tell him

*Last Night , He came over to play some video games to relax and while we were playing, I couldn't help but stare at him for some reason, he noticed and asked ""why are you staring at me?"", I replied with a nothing and he asked me ""Do you love him"", and I replied with a ""yeah, you are like brother"", (I was so ready to fuck his brains off), he looked at me and said "" No, I mean like Love Love Me, like you would date me"" and I just blushed and I said ""yeah"" and he smiled and pecked me on the lips and said ""me Too"". After saying that, he rushed home

He's coming over tomorrow and he said he Wants to tell me something that is important

I need advice guys, does he like me?, should I have kissed him on the night he was drunk?, and why did he rush home like that

Please no mean comment, this is a real problem of mine. Pls help me

I need to get something off my chest and I need some advice. 
I've developed a serious crush on one of my colleagues a few weeks ago (since I work at my new job, to be honest). I work as an assistant at a theatre and he's a singer so every few weeks we work together at a production - it's a pretty intensive work and much time is spent together.
At least he's gay, so I've got that going for me..

With the prelude out of the way, here is the situation: a few days ago I came clean and confessed my feelings. He politely turned me down, saying he didn't share my feelings ""at the moment"" (his exact words) and that it probably wouldn't work because of the age difference (he's around 40, I'm 25).

*ugh*

Knowing that it won't happen didn't give me the closure I've expected, but rather intensified my feelings, my yearning to be with him and make him happy. 
Right now I only see him once or twice a week, during shows and during those few hours I fake beeing okay pretty well, but once I'm alone my mind drifts off to him almost immediately,  which is basically killing me.

Now, I don't know how to handle this. I should give up hope but I don't want to; do you think there's any chance that he'll come around (I know you don't know him so that's a moot question but anyway)? Should I keep trying, or just try to build a friendly relationship (he told me he really liked me and I'm pretty sure he was honest)?
And do you have any tips on how to get over this?

Last note: I'm new in town and with the schedule on my job I don't really have time for dating (or anything hobby-related really) so chances of meeting anyone new are slim. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear gaybros,
