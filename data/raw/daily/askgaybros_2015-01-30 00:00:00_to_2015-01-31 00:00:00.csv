Imagine you are talking to someone for awhile, have a date planned, or maybe even had a few dates. Then the guy you like suddenly drops off the face of the earth. He won't reply to texts. Or maybe even calls or texts.

I have had this happen literally tens of times in the two years since my steady boyfriend and I broke up. And I have even talked about it with guys who then have done it.

This last time was the worst however. I met this guy about a year ago. We went out once. Not sure why we didn't again...but remained Facebook friends. A few months ago I noticed he was hanging out with another guy I knew and they then started dating. It was short lived and one night I messaged him on Facebook and asked how he was doing etc. we ended up hanging out three times that week. He asked me out a few times within the three weeks we were seeing each other. We both talked and he said he liked me and I said I liked him. Cuddled, kissed, etc. I last saw him a week ago, kissed and hugged goodbye and he asked me to please text him when I got home. He texted me a lot the few days afterward...a lot of sweet stuff and then suddenly on Sunday it just stopped. I messaged him Monday asking what's up and then asked yesterday if he wanted To hang out. No reply. Then I looked on Facebook. He has been on and posted a status about ""you're fucking perfect to me"" so I'm guessing there is another guy in the picture. I'm so frustrated and so hurt and I at least want an answer to him as to why or what I did wrong. Any advice on how to proceed?

Had a month to do this huge project, granted I have been dealing with debates and presentations and volunteering and organizing a conference, but I wasted so much time and now i get to fail.

Normally I end up pulling things off the night before and somehow not destroying my GPA but I completely wasted today (and with it any chance of even cramming something to hand in tomorrow). I guess I should probably admit to myself that porn is an addiction for me. I jerk off way to many times a day, mainly when I have something due and just keep coming back to those sites. I have tried NoFap etc. but I have only once even lasted a week and that was because of exams.

I also feel tired all of time. I normally get 5-6 hours sleep, but last night I got 9 and I still couldn't get up. I randomly have to nap in the middle of the day, I have napped like twice already today. Just close my eyes and daydream and fall asleep or just so I don't have to think about anything. 

I know I should be working on this project, everyone I know has finished I don't know why I can't fucking do a project. I was going to get better this term, and not miss anymore classes and get things done on time and even start exercising but nothing is going right and I STILL DON'T CARE. I mean it should click in logically I need to hand something in to pass, and need to start working this absolute second to have something to hand in, but it doesn't even register like I don't care about it or school or anything anymore. I''m avoiding Facebook etc. as usual when this happens because it is too daunting to deal with anyone right now, I don't know why, I just have to isolate myself sometimes. Then sleep, and masturbate and read stories about people who have had horrible things happen to them which is great because it let's me channel all these negative feelings which is actually so messed up. I kind of want somebody to just punch me right now and knock some sense into me or something so I stop being dysfunctional. I am not suicidal, I just don't understand the purpose of life. I don't understand what I could possibly be working towards, having some horrible job so I can keep myself alive until I die? None of it makes sense. Obviously with my sexuality issues and my family and cultural issues I can't even imagine what an ideal future would be. How do people motivate themselves to do anything? This is where the irrational ""boyfriend fix"" thinking comes in too lol, luckily I deleted Grindr so not hopelessly perusing that for my closeted boyfriend fantasy to come true but I'd be lying if I didn't just want someone to just fucking hug and tell me it is going to be okay.

Yes, I have been seeing a counsellor, she is lovely but there aren't really solutions to my problems I guess and we meet twice a month, and when I am there I kind of forget about all of this shit anyway so I probably haven't been able to explain it to her.

I'm 21 year old guy and I bottomed. The guy I did it with was someone I had met online, we had talked for some weeks before meeting. As we both had little experience, we both went to have sex straight ahead, but we had to do it in some woods near a park because we didn't have any other place. It was not the most comfortable of places admittedly.

Anyway, I had brought a condom, so we used it. He put it on and during the whole thing (that didn't last more than a couple of minutes) I was aware of him wearing it, because I was ""helping"" it in, so I could feel it with my hands. Anyway, he came and I guess if someone comes inside you without a condom you should probably feel something, and I didn't feel anything liquid, so I guessed it was alright. However, when he pulled out I touched and there was certainly *something*. I know he spat at some point and I know the condom had some lubricant, and I was able to clean it with a tissue easily enough, so I want to believe it was *not* semen but just a mixture of the lub and his saliva (ugh), but as the hours go by I'm growing more and more anxious. What if the condom broke? What if something abnormal happened and some semen managed to get inside?

At the moment I was not entirely sure what it was and the thing hasn't ""come down"" my butt after I started walking as I've heard cum does (does that even happen?), so I don't know, but I'm kinda scared. It's the first time I have had sex and I certainly enjoyed it, but the ghost of a possible hiv infection haunts me.

**TL;DR**. Had sex for the first time, with protection. He came inside me and was using a condom. I felt something sticky right afterwards, but it wasn't much and cleaned it easily.

A few weeks ago, around Christmas time, I started getting anonymous packages in the mail. The first things were sexy underwear-type stuff and then a sex toys. All the packages were gifts with no sender information. I tried to get clues of who had been sending them; however, I could not piece together who it might be. Then the most recent package was the book by Robbie Rogers. On the cover, there was lengthy note about coming out, thoughts about seeing me in social places, and using the other stuff I had received. Still anonymous. 

I started to freak out more because of the note that came with that book. I am not out to anyone so I was freaking out about it and obviously, it was someone that I know. In my stress, I worked up to calling my best friend who lives across the country. I don't know why, but I came to the rational that he sent me this stuff because he might have figured out that I was gay or something, was encouraging me to come out, and maybe get together with him. 

Well, when I called him it was pretty late(10: p.m.) and it sounded like he was tired. I slowly worked into the items and anonymous stuff. He was mostly quiet and listening the whole time, and I spilled into coming out and other stuff about the sex toy. I rambled on for a long time. To sum it all up, I basically came out to him and got explicit about using the stuff. His reaction wasn't positive. 

He said he really couldn't process most of what I was saying and that he has had a horrible few weeks with work and just wants to go to sleep right now. Then that was it. He said goodnight and hung up the phone. No reaction to what I said. When he was talking it just hit me that it wasn't him and I outed myself to him. The note mentioned seeing me in bars and stuff, and with him and I living so apart, we had not seen each other in person for, like, a year and a half. Plus, when I got on the phone with him I didn't once ask how he was doing. I just spelled into this stuff and talked at him for three quarters of an hour. 

That was a couple of days ago and I haven't heard anything from him. I know he isn't going to care about my sexuality, but I feel like an ass for 1) outing myself like that,  2) railroading him when he was stressed out, and 3) still trying to figure out these packages. 

I really don't know what to do in this situation. Thanks for the vent. Any thoughts?

So here's my deal and I hope someone can help. On New Years I went to my friend's house for a small party he was throwing. I got a lil drunk and met one of his friends who was really attracted to me. We talked, flirted, and even kissed, which I don't usually do but with the drinks n the guy being hot I went for it. We exchanged numbers before I had to leave. Unfortunately he lives in a different state which I don't mind, but he left the next day and we didn't get to hang out. We started talking on the phone for a few days, and he's like the perfect guy! Handsome, good job, has everything going for him and he was/is really interested in me. 

So here is the problem. I found out that he's pretty close with my friend and his family.  I, being an introvert, am very private and I'm also poz, undetectable and healthy. My friend doesn't know my stats because I don't really trust him with keeping it to himself. My friend isn't good at keeping secrets at all n likes to gossip.  It's one of my insecurities disclosing to ppl my stats.

So I cut it off with the guy to save myself from any issues and even rejection. I'm afraid of both, being rejected n my friend finding out about my status. I told him I didn't feel comfortable with dating him because of his relationship with my friend and I felt like it would impact my relationship with him and I might be overstepping.
