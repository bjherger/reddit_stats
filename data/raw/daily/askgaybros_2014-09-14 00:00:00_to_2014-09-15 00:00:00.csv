I'm someone *very* sensitive, and unfortunately I've had my heart broken twice in the past, which almost destroyed me (I harmed myself many times). Two times in a row. Add to that dozens of bad dates (never called back, etc.) and you get someone with psychological scars and a big shitty fear of love itself.

Now it's not that bad, but it also means my mind developed some kind of self-defense system toward guys in order to avoid being hurt again. I've been seeing a therapist for almost a year and apparently one of these self-defense system involve suddenly losing interest in a guy for no reason... Which means I have to *force* myself and fight my mind in order to *want* seeing the guy again.

Here's the tricky part. Although I'm wounded in a way, my caring/romantic/empathetic nature makes me want to have someone to love and spend time with... And there's my strong libido. I've struggled for at least a year because I didn't want to make anyone deal with my shit so I kept my will of having a BF inside my head, but apparently it's not a winning option so...

Now the case (yes, it involves a guy). A guy started talking to me on the internet. We hit off pretty much well, sent each other texts nonstop the first day. Then, the seld-defense triggered for no reason and the interest disappeared, which made me distant and less responsive to his texts, which made me feel guilty because no one deserve to be 'thrown away' when they haven't done anything wrong. I quickly talked about it the next day with my therapist in order to find a solution and the consensus was: I will never get anything if I don't get out of my comfort zone. In short: I have to continue to talk with the guy even if I don't feel at ease.

So he requested a date this week, but the suggested time didn't work for me (job). I gave him my two next availabilities, one of them being today. He chose Sunday. We've both been silent for a day or two. Then he messaged me while I was doing my university initiation, which mean I couldn't reply until the next morning... I asked him yesterday at 10 am when he wanted to see me on Sunday and I've yet to receive an answer. On the other hand he's quite active on instagram so I know he saw my message somehow. My instinct tells me he lost interest too, but we're supposed to have a date.

In the end, here's my dilemma. I don't want to be that guy going all paranoid and all or insisting when the guy doesn't reply. If he doesn't want to answer it's fine by me, I kind of deserve it for being a cold afraid unresponsive distant bitch. But on the other hand, part of me think it's kind of an unfair consequence... If he knew all this, I'm sure he would be more comprehensive, but I don't want to open my book of dramas on day 1, I barely do it to my close friends. I mean, I don't want to explain him that I have wounds, I'm seeing a therapist, I was afraid of being hurt etc., it's way too much for anyone to handle.

Which means I don't know what to do. Another message to know if he still wants a date or ... Since he didn't answer the first time, just take it as a sign and move on?...

Sorry it's kind of long. I'll try to edit.

**TL;DR**: I have psychological wounds because of past broken hearts. A guy spoke to me. Unconscious self defense mechanic made me become distant. Discussed it with my therapist ASAP: I should try to see the guy regardless of my fear. But my distant attitude (because fear) made him distant too and now I don't know how to handle that. I feel like I deserve it, but I also think it's unfair.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll try to make it short and sorry for my broken English.&lt;/p&gt;

I've been in an absolutely terrible way for the past two months since me and a guy stopped seeing each other and my heart just feels incredibly...heavy all the time. I've dated guys (I'm 27 and have been in 2 long-ish relationships before) in the past but this sinking feeling in my chest has never existed until now. :(

What's worse is we kind of mutually ended it. He basically said he didn't know where the relationship was going, and I said I didn't either...and that was that. I wish I would've fought harder at the time instead of basically agreeing with him.  

The truth is I've only realized in the past 2 months how much he actually means to me. I want to tell him how I feel but I don't want to come on too strong and totally push him away.

I don't know what to do honestly. I'm tired of feeling terrible all the time, but I just don't know what to do. I feel like I'm in limbo because I'm still on good terms with him, yet I haven't seen him in two months. He doesn't seem to be interested in hanging out and I can't tell if he's just being nice by chatting with me whenever I message him.

My family is part of a very conservative christian faith with cult-ish tendencies. By cult-ish I mean that the head leader of the church is believed to have superhuman abilities and revered as an apostle of god. There's more fishy things about this church but the important thing is that I left the church and its crazy ass beliefs.

I've recently come out to my Mom as an athiest (around January), news which she didn't take lightly. We had a fight and everything, she even told me that ""she wouldn't take any more of my surprises"". I thought things would cool down but my sister later informed me that she would find my mom crying and unmotivated, to which she believed to be some sort of depression. This news took a toll on me  and I was filled with guilt, adding to my own depression, I felt like I was screwing up and hurting people I cared for. Time passed and I  ended my year of college (around June) and returned back home. Well, things cooled down but my mom still disapproved my rebellion and said that I was ""walking away from my roots"". I ignored her remarks and planned to stay in the closet at least in my home. Back in college, I had come out to a bunch of people and I felt great about it, feeling like it was a great accomplishment. I figured that when I returned in September I would be able to explore more of this gay identity over at college. So, all summer I endured her remarks. She would invite me to go to church and when I said no she would say things like ""that's sad"" or she would give me THE look. The thing is that it just wasn't her, everyone in my household was doing this. I felt like no one was taking me seriously. Like it was just a phase, or that I didn't really understand the ways of god because I was too young and I hadn't experienced the ""harshness of life"". ""Tu y tus tonteras"", my sister would say. I felt like no one had my back and everyone felt the same way.

Well, one day I snapped (more specifically 3 days ago), I screamed at my mom saying that the church was all a lie and that the leader was a fraud. The latter mortified her, I had spoken heresy. She began defending the leader adamantly even stating that she would proudly die for the church. She told me that if I wanted her to still be my mother then I had to keep my mouth shut when referring to the ""apostle"". I was in complete shock, she preferred her church over her own son. I could never come out, the church had won, I had lost. I started crying, my mom and my sister were my only family and any chances of acceptance dwindled to nothing. My mom just looked at me oddly and left the room. After I stopped crying, I got angry and I just couldn't look at her anymore. Days passed and I gave her the silent treatment, which I know got her feeling very guilty. It wasn't until today that I decided that I had to talk with my mom about it, I wanted her to know that even if she didn't love me unconditionally, I did, because she worked so hard to keep me and my sister moving forward and I was grateful for that. (She credits that to god not herself which really bugs me.) We started talking again, the conversation quickly became a religious discussion which I had to stop because it was going nowhere.

After the religious discussion which lasted about 30 minutes there was silence. Then there was a sincere moment which led to the title of this post. I swallowed my pride and I apologized to her for raising my voice and putting her in a tough spot between her religion and her children. I told her that I was unhappy within the church and that my real goal was to be happy. She replied that she was certain that outside the church I would not find happiness. A few moments later she began telling me that she sensed something in me. She sensed a rage within me, which she felt was fueling my rebellion. She was puzzled as to why I was feeling this way since the church had not wronged me. She wanted to know what that rage was. I said nothing but I felt that she was catching on. We concluded our talk, and she said that she knew she couldn't do anything about my decisions. They saddened her but the were my decisions. Finally she said ""no matter which decisions you make you're still my son"".

All in all, my mom is not a bad person. She just feels this camaraderie with her fellow church members and an unquestionable loyalty to the church leader. To her, this has been what she's known all her life, so any words against that is just pure craziness. She has her faith but I know that she cares. I know that she thinks that the church is the best place for me. I would totally do that to make her happy. But that rage still burns inside me, the longing for a relationship that is meaningful. I'm gay I can't fucking deny it, it's there. Heck, I remember more guys in my classes than girls. In my memories, the girls just seem like a bunch of Cousin Itts from the Addams family.

So yeah, I'm conflicted. I'm once again unsure whether coming out at all is a good idea. My mom gives me mixed signals, I have no idea how she would take the news now. The church is pretty much more anti-catholic than homophobic.

I also feel like this whole ""how will my mom take the news"" game is going to affect any future relationships. If I'm with someone, I don't wanna feel ashamed or feel the need to hide it. I want to be out and proud about it, even make it facebook official. I plan to come out after college when I'm self-sufficient. But again this brings me back to the same question, and I don't know how I would react to her response.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d like to start off with the fact that I&amp;#39;m a gaybro who&amp;#39;s in search for a world outside the one established by my christian origins. My family is part of a very conservative christian faith with cult-ish tendencies. By cult-ish I mean that the head leader of the church is believed to have superhuman abilities and revered as an apostle of god. There&amp;#39;s more fishy things about this church but the important thing is that I left the church and its crazy ass beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve recently come out to my Mom as an athiest (around January), news which she didn&amp;#39;t take lightly. We had a fight and everything, she even told me that &amp;quot;she wouldn&amp;#39;t take any more of my surprises&amp;quot;. I thought things would cool down but my sister later informed me that she would find my mom crying and unmotivated, to which she believed to be some sort of depression. This news took a toll on me  and I was filled with guilt, adding to my own depression, I felt like I was screwing up and hurting people I cared for. Time passed and I  ended my year of college (around June) and returned back home. Well, things cooled down but my mom still disapproved my rebellion and said that I was &amp;quot;walking away from my roots&amp;quot;. I ignored her remarks and planned to stay in the closet at least in my home. Back in college, I had come out to a bunch of people and I felt great about it, feeling like it was a great accomplishment. I figured that when I returned in September I would be able to explore more of this gay identity over at college. So, all summer I endured her remarks. She would invite me to go to church and when I said no she would say things like &amp;quot;that&amp;#39;s sad&amp;quot; or she would give me THE look. The thing is that it just wasn&amp;#39;t her, everyone in my household was doing this. I felt like no one was taking me seriously. Like it was just a phase, or that I didn&amp;#39;t really understand the ways of god because I was too young and I hadn&amp;#39;t experienced the &amp;quot;harshness of life&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;Tu y tus tonteras&amp;quot;, my sister would say. I felt like no one had my back and everyone felt the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, one day I snapped (more specifically 3 days ago), I screamed at my mom saying that the church was all a lie and that the leader was a fraud. The latter mortified her, I had spoken heresy. She began defending the leader adamantly even stating that she would proudly die for the church. She told me that if I wanted her to still be my mother then I had to keep my mouth shut when referring to the &amp;quot;apostle&amp;quot;. I was in complete shock, she preferred her church over her own son. I could never come out, the church had won, I had lost. I started crying, my mom and my sister were my only family and any chances of acceptance dwindled to nothing. My mom just looked at me oddly and left the room. After I stopped crying, I got angry and I just couldn&amp;#39;t look at her anymore. Days passed and I gave her the silent treatment, which I know got her feeling very guilty. It wasn&amp;#39;t until today that I decided that I had to talk with my mom about it, I wanted her to know that even if she didn&amp;#39;t love me unconditionally, I did, because she worked so hard to keep me and my sister moving forward and I was grateful for that. (She credits that to god not herself which really bugs me.) We started talking again, the conversation quickly became a religious discussion which I had to stop because it was going nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the religious discussion which lasted about 30 minutes there was silence. Then there was a sincere moment which led to the title of this post. I swallowed my pride and I apologized to her for raising my voice and putting her in a tough spot between her religion and her children. I told her that I was unhappy within the church and that my real goal was to be happy. She replied that she was certain that outside the church I would not find happiness. A few moments later she began telling me that she sensed something in me. She sensed a rage within me, which she felt was fueling my rebellion. She was puzzled as to why I was feeling this way since the church had not wronged me. She wanted to know what that rage was. I said nothing but I felt that she was catching on. We concluded our talk, and she said that she knew she couldn&amp;#39;t do anything about my decisions. They saddened her but the were my decisions. Finally she said &amp;quot;no matter which decisions you make you&amp;#39;re still my son&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, my mom is not a bad person. She just feels this camaraderie with her fellow church members and an unquestionable loyalty to the church leader. To her, this has been what she&amp;#39;s known all her life, so any words against that is just pure craziness. She has her faith but I know that she cares.

I want to have sex with another man.

It's not that I don't find my partners attractive or don't like them touching me or anything, it's just like all of a sudden I'm turned off. It's like the sex we're having doesn't seem right, they're suddenly unappealing, I go soft and the mood is ruined. I try to start back up again but it just comes in waves, I get hard... I go soft. 

I have to enter my own little fantasy world and close my eyes or have the room be completely dark. It is so bad when the light is on. And then I start telling myself ""you better stay hard or you're going to ruin it"" and that's when I go soft. 

Kissing is such a turn on for me and it gets me hard straight away, but I feel so uncomfortable when we start to take our clothes off. I hate the way my body looks and I feel turned off by them even though I liked what they looked like when they had clothes on.

What is wrong with me? I used to get super bad social anxiety and so that might be part of it, but I've pretty much been cured of that now. I watch porn almost everyday and I'm start to lean towards watching more and more *aggressive* porn.

all my life i fantasized about women to the point of obsession. i was hopelessly infatuated with them emotionally and physically. but most of my life i was scrawny and labelled as 'cute' but NEVER had any relationship. it just never happened. not great for my self esteem so i focused all my negativity into the gym and gained 30lbs of lean muscle in a few years and got 30x more cynical. now i compare myself to other very ripped guys to gauge where i think i am in terms of physical attractiveness. for the most part I'm pretty happy but I still envied guys with features that i assumed women found attractive. like mass. as an ectomorph, this is still more of a goal.

anyways, i found myself finding these features attractive too and met an openly gay but masculine model online. he's not as muscular but i still feel he's a 10/10 (shallow? yes). and we happen to have a lot in common and live near each other. we hung out twice and I genuinely liked making a friend out of him. then he texts me about how he was thinking of making a move on me the whole time and i admitted that it would have been exciting. 

we chat every day and the following week he came to my place and some sparks flew. we made out but then i put the breaks on to admit to him that i'm not out and never plan to be for various reasons and fears. plus i'd like to end up with women or just end up alone since that's what i'm used to at this point (i'm 29). and i valued him as a friend. he was very understanding and asked more questions and made me feel comfortable even though i had never admitted this out loud and my heart was racing. also, buttsex is a turnoff for me so i would make a bad boyfriend. then he proceeded to make out with me STILL and we got hand jobs. that was fun.

The next week he comes over to watch a movie and then he's all over me again, we do the same thing but spend more time together just laying there. i thought it was nice.... but then i was getting bored. there's not much else i'm interested in doing. when it was time for him to go, he was really crushing on me and said something like he can't wait to see me again and he loves spending time with me. and i can't believe my instant thought was 'oh shit this is never going to end'. 

the guy has a lot of spirit and integrity and any gay guy would be fucking lucky to have someone like him romantically interested... but i'm no longer interested in any kind of intermit fun. now that i have been with a guy i consider EXTREMELY HOT, i'm over the whole thing. i'd like to think that i made a great new friend and now i want to curb any future sexy contact without hurting his feelings. he is well aware of my closet issue so that's been said, but it's starting to scare me that he thinks there could be a future by how he is talking to me :(","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;i may have made a big mistake :S&lt;/p&gt;

My son came out to me last night, after telling me people have been bullying him at school. It broke my heart to see him so upset, i just want to find whoever made him feel this way and tear them a new one. I have a lot of empathy for him, school wasn't easy for me either when i was his age (my teachers used to bully me just as much as the other kids), so i know what it feels like. 

A bit of background: Me and my wife didn't ever think we'd have kids - we struggled to conceive at first - so he's our miracle boy really. He's always been a pretty incredible kid, always marched to the beat of his own drum so to speak. We've always hated the idea of telling kids to 'man up' and all that jazz, so we've never censored him. It's been in the back of our minds since he was really young he might be gay...but haven't wanted to put him on the spot by asking him. He has a few little girl friends who hes close with, but he doesn't have any guy friends that we know of. When he was four he told us he wanted to learn to dance, and its been something we've always encouraged because it makes him so happy (plus, kid has moves). We've always been honest with in telling him that some people are different and that's OK, so hes always been OK with the idea of gay/lesbian/transgender people. He just cant understand why some people are so mean to him.

When he told me i felt kind of overwhelmed. He cried so much after he told me (well, i did too), and it made me so damn proud that he had the guts to be honest with me, and i felt so much love in my heart for him. I hugged him and told him that its a privilege to be his dad, how insanely proud of him i was and that no matter what he says or does i could never love him any less. To be honest i cant wait for the day he finds someone special (this i told him as well).

Apparently hes known for about 2 years now, why did he wait so long to say anything? I'm kind of out of my depth here. I cant talk to my wife because he wants to be the one to tell her, and DEFINITELY not my relatives, because they're narrow minded idiots. I know i cant be around 24/7 to protect him, but I know there's people out there that will hurt his spirit given the chance and that just kills me. Ive made an appointment with his teacher, but how do i encourage his confidence? and what advice should i give him? is there more i should be doing? His birthday is coming up soon, and once his mum knows I want to do something amazing for him, something that just blows his mind, so he has no doubt at all just how special he is to us. Ideas..?

Sorry if this is kind of long and all over the place, my mind is a bit muddled at the moment. 

Edit: my son is ten if that helps (Young, i know).

**Edit: I had no idea this would get such a response. Thank you all so much for all your ideas and experiences, I assure you all ill keep them in the back of my mind as me, my wife and son go through this together (Milo told his mum, and I think she near squeezed him to death. Kinda like a python.). Thanks for the birthday ideas too - my wife knows someone that works behind the scenes as an assistant at a dance production happening soon in our city, and he agreed to take Milo under his wing and meet some of the dancers. I don't think our ears will handle the decibels when we tell him. He's gay as well so we figure he'll be a good influence.

Apparently my wife has decided down the track I'm the one who will be giving the sex talk (her logic is that I have a penis and so does he, and I'm the one who taught him to pee standing up). Since he told us he seems different - his eyes seem blue-er, like a weight has been lifted off his shoulders. Were still kind of overwhelmed by how we feel about him - he rolls his eyes because we cant stop hugging and kissing him, but we tell him he's ours for at least 7 more years yet so there. We're the lucky ones not him, and are so happy he trusted us enough to share this beautiful part of his life with us. If it turns out later on that he's straight, then thats ok too - we'll follow his lead. Although right now he says he wants to marry a unicorn.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sorry for all the words)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My son came out to me last night, after telling me people have been bullying him at school. It broke my heart to see him so upset, i just want to find whoever made him feel this way and tear them a new one. I have a lot of empathy for him, school wasn&amp;#39;t easy for me either when i was his age (my teachers used to bully me just as much as the other kids), so i know what it feels like. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bit of background: Me and my wife didn&amp;#39;t ever think we&amp;#39;d have kids - we struggled to conceive at first - so he&amp;#39;s our miracle boy really. He&amp;#39;s always been a pretty incredible kid, always marched to the beat of his own drum so to speak. We&amp;#39;ve always hated the idea of telling kids to &amp;#39;man up&amp;#39; and all that jazz, so we&amp;#39;ve never censored him. It&amp;#39;s been in the back of our minds since he was really young he might be gay...but haven&amp;#39;t wanted to put him on the spot by asking him. He has a few little girl friends who hes close with, but he doesn&amp;#39;t have any guy friends that we know of. When he was four he told us he wanted to learn to dance, and its been something we&amp;#39;ve always encouraged because it makes him so happy (plus, kid has moves). We&amp;#39;ve always been honest with in telling him that some people are different and that&amp;#39;s OK, so hes always been OK with the idea of gay/lesbian/transgender people. He just cant understand why some people are so mean to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When he told me i felt kind of overwhelmed. He cried so much after he told me (well, i did too), and it made me so damn proud that he had the guts to be honest with me, and i felt so much love in my heart for him.

First a little backround.. Bi-black guy here who up until about a week ago I have never been with another guy, but have fantasized about it for several years now. I mean I really really wanted to go down a guy and even bought a dildo to experiment with. So I just moved to a new city and decided to get a grindr account to see if I can give it a try (safely of course).

So this is where I might sound silly but please stay with me... See my face is so so but I have pretty good body ( I exercise a lot), I'm fairly tall (6'1), muscular( 205lb), and fairly well endowed (8in). Since I am new to a lot of this I posted a picture of my upper body (minus my face) as my profile pic. Now I have been a lurker in this subredit for almost a year now and have heard that grindr is not really a place for men of color, so I prepaired myself for low expectations. To my surprise I was flooded with a ridiculous ammount of messages from all sorts of people( totally was not expecting it)! Sooo I started talking to a lot of them and exchanging pics as well ( learned a lot about guys and grindr real quick). 

Anyway (don't judge me) but I wind up safely hooking up with a couple guys because I really wanted to try giving head. Now in all of our conversations I made it clear that I was new to the 'scene' and really wanted go down on a guy, but start slow. All of them were super into my body and...you know, what I have down below, which was cool with me. So when we meat up every single one of them just want go go down on me. When I ask if I can try doing it to them, it's like they almost get annoyed like it's some sort of burden to even let me try. They let me try ( which I really liked, and they seemed to enjoy as well I guess), but they would only let me do a little before they would jump right back to me. One guy would not even let me try (and his cock was flat out beautiful). It's not just them either, almost all of the guys I chat with are all fixated on my body and dick, and when I bring up the idea of me going down on them, they try to bring it back to me either being a top, or going down on me. This happens even when the guy claims to be versatile.
Does anybody have any tips or ideas on what I can do?

&lt;p&gt;Anyway (don&amp;#39;t judge me) but I wind up safely hooking up with a couple guys because I really wanted to try giving head. Now in all of our conversations I made it clear that I was new to the &amp;#39;scene&amp;#39; and really wanted go down on a guy, but start slow. All of them were super into my body and...you know, what I have down below, which was cool with me. So when we meat up every single one of them just want go go down on me. When I ask if I can try doing it to them, it&amp;#39;s like they almost get annoyed like it&amp;#39;s some sort of burden to even let me try. They let me try ( which I really liked, and they seemed to enjoy as well I guess), but they would only let me do a little before they would jump right back to me. One guy would not even let me try (and his cock was flat out beautiful). It&amp;#39;s not just them either, almost all of the guys I chat with are all fixated on my body and dick, and when I bring up the idea of me going down on them, they try to bring it back to me either being a top, or going down on me. This happens even when the guy claims to be versatile.
Does anybody have any tips or ideas on what I can do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tl;dr 
Got a grindr account to give head, got several dozen messages a day, but only to work as a dominant top. Super frustrated because I have wanted to do this for several years now!&lt;/p&gt;

I would like to start by saying I hope this isnt a dumb question to post here.

So I am a gay guy who is on the bigger side (not huge, but not thin) and as of recently ( just graduated college) I have had a lot of time to myself and because of that I got lazy. I also developed a habit of feeling very guilty and depressed after I eat and it makes me hate myself. I know I shouldnt feel this way and I need help fixing it. 

I want to lose weight but I have a hard time with motivation and depression :( gyms depress me mostly cause I am a big guy and I feel like people are laughing at me if I go to the gym like ""why is he even bothering.""

I had an ex who liked me this size but since my break up LAST YEAR i havent had any new possible boyfriends/dates/anything and it is eating away at me since I have now entered the real world of work and no longer am at college...

I am not sure what to do anymore so I am here asking for advice :/","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi...&lt;/p&gt;

No need to say I went through a lot of shitty things until I realized I had to see/feel happy on my own, to really value the stuff I have in order to be truly satisfied with myself.

Now, you see, I have this ideology, I know this, I have seen this for myself and I definitely do not want a boyfriend right now- I have a shit load of stuff on college etc. I just can't deal with it '-'

But I still am having trouble with the whole feeling down stuff... I have known great people in college, and some of them I can, in time, call good/great friends, I have amazing opportunities for growth and career there and I love pursuing that...   And still, sometimes I feel really down '-'

So last night I went to a gay night in my hometown with my usual crowd of friends.
We had a great time, got just the *right* amount of tipsy, danced our asses off, stayed til closing time (4am). A pleasantly wild night.
I'm going through a rough patch with my bf so it was nice to take my mind off things and blow off some steam 

Anyway, something baffled me: 90% of the guys there, regardless of their age, were sitting at the bar, or lounging around chatting away on their smartphones.
At first I thought ""that's new media for you"" and shrugged it off, but then I realized that quite a few of them were actually on dating apps, and chatting with guys at the very same bar.
WTF?!

Have we gotten so socially lazy that we need apps to mediate encounters *in gay clubs*?
I don't mean to generalize, and I know that guys in my region are known to be stuck-up and not very friendly...but I just find it so pointless!
And none of these guys were at the bar on their own, cuz that would be somehow justifiable, no...they were all part of a group too!

While there, we had the time of my life, and met some cool people that we plan on hanging out with.
Very few guys were dancing, at times we had the whole dance-floor to ourselves!

TL;DR: went to a gay club last night with my friends. had a blast and met a lot of cool people.
However it appeared that the general trend among the guys there was to strike up a conversation on Grindr/Hornet/etc., instead of just going and say ""hi"" to the guy you find cute.
Are cliques 3.0 the dullest thing ever to hit the scene? ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey bros.&lt;/p&gt;
