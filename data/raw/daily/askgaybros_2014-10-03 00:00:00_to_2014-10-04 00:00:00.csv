So, Tuesday night I engaged in receptive anal sex for the first time. Let me just start off by saying it was amazing, I came hands free and everything. 

ANYHOO, so yesterday I noticed some discomfort or pain, akin to what I'd feel if I were constipated or something and had been straining. General asshole soreness. Didn't think much of it since I just took a pounding. This morning there was blood. Not a whole lot, not even enough to turn crimson on toilet paper, it was a pinkish hue, so I know it's not bleeding profusely or anything, but I am not sure how concerned I should be. 
Is this normal? Is this something that should be persisting til a couple days later? The first day I had no blood that I noticed. I should also note that this seems to be an internal issue, blood doesn't appear until I start a BM.


Will it heal of its own accord, or should I go see a doctor? I'm really anxious about this and not sure what to do. Definitely don't want to go to doctor and explain to him that I got my ass fucked if it's not necessary. 

Is there any way I can avoid this in the future? The guy who wounded me, I've been seeing him for a while and enjoy his company, I don't want to but I'm on the verge of telling him that I am no longer down to get poked.

I've done the big dramatic, explosive break up before. This isn't what happened here.

I started dated a guy because I was physically attracted to him, he was physically attracted to me, and our worldviews aligned pretty nicely. It was a very easy relationship. In the back of my mind, I knew it had no lasting power. This guy was great, but we didn't have enough common interests or lifestyles... I thought of him as an amazing ""for now"" boyfriend, but there was always the sense that I knew I wasn't going to end up with the guy, and didn't particularly want to.

So, after 6 months of dating, we broke up. This was a month ago. I'm still really sad. And I don't understand it. I KNEW from the onset this was temporary, and that our compatibility was loose. I even imagined how our parting of ways might eventually go. Distance became an issue, and we decided to just pull the plug. But now I'm sitting here weeks later, still mourning the loss of this relationship. I want our inside jokes to mean something to someone besides just me again. I want to cook with him (our usual past time). We didn't have fantastic conversations often... All of our best conversations occurred after having sex. But I want them back too. 

I lost this great little thing that I knew was temporary, but emotionally I'm feeling like I lost something way more than it was...","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was my third relationship.
