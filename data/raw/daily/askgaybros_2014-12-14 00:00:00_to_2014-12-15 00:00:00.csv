1) Reinforce his masculinity... He feels less of a man while bottoming so I think and have try to compliment his masculinity and its working! 

Any particular advice about how to reinforce his masculinity? He is kind of a sport jock and visually he seems extremely masculine so he is an easy target for masculinity compliment but... to be honest... I have never compliment a guy for being masculine so I don't know how to do it...


2) Make him feel protected... I usually date guys that like to be... well (sexually speaking) treated as a bitch and I liked that, I like to be a dominant top so I'm more than agree with that... But with him this dynamic didn't work and I think that his thing is that he likes to feel protected, he likes when I look at him while fucking him, if I kiss him he prefer a slow kiss over a passionate one, he likes if I ask him if is hurting, he likes a lot when I hug him and but he isn't into the romantic side of it... He likes it because that makes him feel that someone is taking care of him... Kinda Daddy-Son protective situation...

As you probably guessed from the title, I have had weight issues for several years now (I'm 20 and attending college). I'm definitely not noticeably fat like 'stop-and-stare-at-how-fat-he-is' fat, but I'm overweight. My belly sticks out a little, and more obviously my thighs/legs are the size of a house. Like, two... We're talking semi-detached.

Before any of the hyper-active gym protein-shakers get on my case, I have been doing something about it, and I've lost a little weight slowly over the last couple on months, and hope to speed the process up over the course of next year.

The thing is, there's this guy in college that I really like, and I don't know if I'm just being crazy, but I think he likes me too, in the shy 'why-hasn't-he-asked-me-out-yet' way. Also, he is definitely gay. When I look in the mirror, I don't feel that the person I currently am is someone that he should be attached to when he could be doing much better. I'm kinda insecure when it comes to stuff like this.

Even if by some miracle we did end up dating, I can't say for certain whether or not he would get bored of me (pretty much haven't been anyone's boyfriend for real), or cheat on me with someone who's a lot fitter. Sex is hard to think about, because everyone I know is matchstick-slim and all tucked in whereas I'm... large and clunky, with folds. Eurgh.

I don't want to be alone for the next year, but I can't go into any relationships without severe trust issues, that might not even go away after I lose weight. I'll always feel inferior, like whoever I'm with is 1000x more attractive than me and would ditch me at the drop of a hat for someone better.

 Almost nobody interesting was on (small town) but then this guy comes on and he's horny so I went for it. He was a bottom and I'm vers (at least I think so). Also he's 29 and I'm 25. 

So it all went pretty smooth, but I was kind of nervous because I had to be in charge. He was very understanding though.

So we fucked for quite a bit, I honestly thought I would cum after the first thrust but I actually felt less stimulated than expected. 

He then came and kind of tried to finish me off until I tried to finish me off. I couldn't do it for the love of all that's holy. I tried and went half soft. I kind of apologized but he was fine with it.

Thing is, I don't know what to make of this. The guy was hot af and I honestly questioned my sexuality (again) while fucking him. 

I drank two beers beforehand to cure my nervousness but that never hindered me from going full mast.

Here's the deal: I've only dated women my whole life, the only time I've been in love was with a woman, but at this point in my life I know I would be much happier pursuing relationships with men.

Now if the right girl came along I would happily see where things went. The problem is I feel like there is such a negative view of bisexuals (even I am more squeamish to identify as bi than as gay) and I would only date a girl under a very special circumstance if she was just something truly phenomenal. So my question is do I just not worry about that 15% and come out just as anyone else would? And then if a girl came along cross that bridge when I come to it?

If my friends or family respond negatively to my coming out I don't want to give them false hope that this is just a phase and I'll marry a woman and pop out 2 1/2 kids in the suburbs cause that's not gonna happen.

However I've realized that I need to actually love the women for who they are in order to pursue a relationship (I now would finally like to have a long term one), and because of this I've stopped masturbating and try to focus on less-sexual aspects of women in order to see more fully who they are. 

And then this dream comes in. I've always assumed I wasn't gay, I find certain men attractive and like the aesthetic's of a muscular male body, but not in a sexual way. I suppose I know I'm not gay because I'm so attracted to women, but could I be bisexual?

Why?  I teach high school.  I live in the same community where I teach.  It's a small city.  My boss is conservative.  Our local news media likes doing negative stories on the schools and on teachers.  About once a month there's a story in the paper about a teacher doing something indiscriminate and getting arrested and fired.  (Seriously.  I don't know whats up with this place.) 

Am I trying to get out?  Yes.  Hopefully next year.  In the meantime I'm trying to make my $45K salary (which I need), and not raise any controversy.  I need positive references from this job. 

And basically: guys are jerks.  About 80% of the time, the conversation goes like this.  
Me: Hey!
Them:  Hey whats up?
Me: Just chillin.  Watching the Falcons game.  Hbu? 
Them:  Pic?
At which point I explain I'm not ready to give it out yet, and the guy never talks to me again.  Or says something hateful and never talks to me again. 

I want to put something in my Grindr profile that heads this off.  What can I say in my profile without sounding like a jerk?  

The other bad thing is that if the conversation turns sexual in any way, and I'm talking to a guy within 20 miles of here, I have to cut it off or change the direction of the conversation.  Completely.  It's one thing to say something intimate/sexual to a guy in person.  It's another thing to have a written record of it on the internet.  Plus these are guys I hardly know, so I'm not going to put my career in their hands.

&lt;p&gt;Quite honestly I&amp;#39;ve almost given up on dating or trying to date, except on long weekends away from home, and until this teaching contract is over. &lt;/p&gt;

I usually have trouble maintaining eye contact with people because I'm quite shy, but he often glances at me until we lock eyes. It makes me feel nice. Just yesterday, as he was leaving he stopped by the door before he left work, waited until I made eye contact with him and said ""Bye (my name)"" before leaving. I honestly feel like I'm 16 again or something. I'm trying not to get my hopes up because they're paid to be nice to people, but goddamn. He's so kind. How do I initiate conversation with him? I'm so shy, so this kind of thing scares me.  I thought of catching him right as he clocked out, because I really don't want to put him on the spot in front of his coworkers or others in line.

Basically if I color my hair (a little bit of gray) I look like I'm in my late 20's or early 30's.  I'm actually pushing 45.  

I've found out from experience, in my small-minded region of the country, that if I put my real age on my profile, I get rejected by anyone under 50 without them even taking a second look.  Complete pre-judgement, even hostility, and not even an openness for conversation. 

There used to be a ""gentlemanly agreement"" (even my aunt does this, ha), that once you hit a certain age, you tell people you're 29 or 39 or whatever it is you decide works for you, and that was actually considered classy.  For older women especially, there was a certain respect for not asking one's age, especially if the woman could pull off the charm, charisma, chutzpah to hold her own with those younger than her.  It was a form of rebellion that people liked.  So does that still hold true in today's world?

I would almost rather post that I'm 29, and get conversations, and then open up to someone after I'm a little closer to them and know if they're into me or not.  I've been friends/lovers with guys who are 23 and 25 and they did not care at all what I said my age was or what it actually was.  There was chemistry and we were into each other and that was all that mattered.  

I don't handle constant rejection well and it pisses me off to be rejected because of a number.

I'm a frequent commenter and visiter with a issue I'd prefer not to have on my usual account, hence the throwaway. Also, apology in advance for the ramble.

So, about two weeks ago, I got a message on growlr from a couple looking for a threesome. They have been together over 5 years, super commited, the whole nine yards, just looking for a hookup. Fine, cool, I can deal with that. We talk for two whole days on the app, and quickly conversation became...different. When I say different, I mean it wasn't typical hookup questions, kinks, quirks, etc. They wanted to know my interests, passions, goals, fears, and stuff of that nature. Well, I agreed to meet them that night at a local burger joint for food, to meet each other and break the ice. It was great. They were both cool guys, both attractive, down to earth, and I didn't get any weird vibes. Everything was peaches.

Then the bomb. They where opening their relationship to a third. Great. My luck. It started to make sense as to why all the personal questions. Anywhoo, I really didn't think too much of it in the beginning, but it wasn't something I was immediately comfortable with. Though I mean hell, it's been MONTHS since a dude has shown interest in me let alone two at the same time, so I decided to ride this wave. Again, peaches. Now for the sake of names, its Tom and Jerry. Tom is the more attractive of the two, the one with the better outlook on life, the one with the most ""potential"" in the sense of a college degree and a will to pursue a career in said degree. Hes funny, charismatic, charming, and all around pleasant guy to be around. Jerry and i share a lot of the same interests and hes great fu nto be around, but less motivated and more pessimistic about the future. Sparing a lot of the fill details, But I've spent more time with Tom (AT JERRYS REQUEST) because of Jerry's work schedule so jerry time was needed to ""even the playing field"" in a sense. 

A week into this mess, Jerry texts me telling me he can't do this. He isn't comfortable with the idea, Tom is acting recklessly, I shouldn't message either one of them anymore, blah blah blah. At this point, I has spent a great amount of time with Tom and I started to develop feelings for him, and the feelings felt mutual. Shit hit the fan. 

Jerry gave tom ultimatums (like break up terms), and Tom apparently told jerry to fuck off. Jerry got physical, abusing Tom (this also apparently isn't uncommon), Jerry kicks tom out, brings him back, only to break up with him, and then put his hands on him again. I don't know, at this point, I'm confused as hell but concerned for Tom's safety. So during all of this, Tom and I continue to see each other (study together, get food, let him cry and vent).

Apparently Tom has had a lot going on lately ( family passing, losing job offers, etc) and I have given him a sense of stability and comfort. He really is a great guy, someone I could see myself falling for. The problem is this fucking situation. I am confused, scared, nervous, angry, sad at the whole thing. On one hand, I feel like a homewrecker, but on the other, Tom should have gotten out years ago due to the abuse, infidelity on Jerry's part, jerry's mooching off Tom's success etc. (as of today, Jerry is at his mom's house, they are ""taking a break"" but Jerry wants to get back together.)

I don't know what to do. Should I get the fuck out now? Should I consider what the future might hold with Tom. Should I call the police on Jerry? I have not clue. I left out A LOT of drama and details, but i felt like i was rambling enough. Any advice is great advice. Thanks in advance bros. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey bros.
