Any advice and thoughts would be welcomed, but this is also for my personal musings.
So about a year and a half ago I had a gay thought at a party while drunk. This thought turned into an obsession where I would think about it 24/7, cry, throw up, lay in bed all day so on so forth for about a year. In addition to that when it first happened I would walk around and judge each and every person male or female. The very next day I went to see a movie with a friend and he brought one of his friends from college and I was freaking out internally from meeting him. He was extremely good looking and I couldn't handle the thought of thinking that so I went home and puked. I immediately told my family what was going on with me and they just told me that they thought it was a random thought and that my past history would refute it. And it does. I had two girlfriends I had that I loved very much and would spend all day thinking about them. The months prior to this happening I did notice my attraction towards women fading. However in my life I know for 100% my only boners came from females. Touching hands, kissing, etc. I cannot recall having feelings for a male prior to this occurring. So I went through a year or so with fighting these thoughts about me being gay and actually met a girl that I felt a lot for. However, these thoughts and something else that I can't put my finger on kept me from being happy with her.
 
After that I have taken steps to becoming okay with the fact that I may be gay. In fact some days I just say ""Fuck it I am gay whatever""  and on those days I actually notice girls more and that attraction comes back. Anyway, I have gotten to handle the stress more and lately have been ok with the thoughts. I tried watching gay porn and wasn't able to do anything with it. I have consistently watched straight porn and have enjoyed it. However irl I am not able to muster those feelings towards women. 
I guess I am just really confused. I got coffee with that one girl last week and once again felt a ton of feelings for her again, but I am still noticing a ton of guys that I think are attractive. I would just like to know if anyone else has gong through something like this, and what they did to get over it.

In my youth, I took a very cavalier approach to this (e.g. 'just put some of my body lotion on your dick' - *shivers*). But, in the past few years as I have become older and wiser, I now take a much more structured/healthy approach.

Even with my current plan though, it still takes ~24-48 hours for my ass/BMs to return to normalcy after bottoming. Hopefully, I can do better. Moreover, I am worried about my long-term health - I want to do whatever possible to reduce the risk of hemorrhoids and the like, while still being able to bottom at least once a week.

I am particularly interested in post-sex or daily rituals that help in this regard. Preparation, cleanliness, and communication are discussed frequently, but little is said about post-sex. Nonetheless, any and all recommendations - including product recommendations - are welcome.

_______

My regimen, to start the conversation - if I know I'm going to bottom soon (warning, may be a little gross):

1) Sit on the toilet and poop whatever I can.

2) Take a shower and wash with soap outside of the anus as much as possible. Usually three passes.

3) Insert one finger as far as I can, and feel for fecal matter. If there's any in there, I lightly dig it out - or even return to the toilet. (I prefer not to enema due to long-term health concerns). 

4) Once there's no more fecal matter, I'll get up to two fingers, then thoroughly wash my fingers before turning off the shower.

5) Put a dime's worth of lube on my finger and insert into my ass. I have liked both [Pjur Backdoor](http://www.amazon.com/Pjur-Backdoor-Glide-Personal-Lubricant/dp/B0018OH6IG) and [Wet](http://www.walgreens.com/store/c/wet-platinum-premium-lubricant/ID=prod3165680-product). 

6) I then put a dime of lube on the tip of my anal toy - I have an [Aneros](http://www.aneros.com/) - and insert it. If we're in foreplay mode, it can be fun to leave it in for a while before pulling it out.

7) If any more fecal matter has shown up, I clean up again.

8) Now I'm ready to get fucked. I put another dime of lube on the tip of his penis and spread it.

9) Have awesome sex (making sure to start slow).

10) Afterward, I get back in the shower, or at least sit on the toilet and excrete whatever's up there, cleaning the anal area again.

11) Finally, I apply an anal balm post-sex - [this is the one I use](http://www.amazon.com/Dr-Wheatgrass-Superbalm-150ml-Multi-purpose/dp/B001V7IJHW).

We've been trying to Skype/masturbate together. I'm not having any luck getting close to getting off.

I'm very mindful of where the camera is at all times. I'm mindful of the fact that one of my roommates might hear what's going on. I find my boyfriend extremely attractive. But I can't get, or stay, hard. He's not having similar issues. He can cum in about 10-15 minutes, no problem, and he's hard the entire time. I really really like watching. It's really hot.  My body is not cooperating. 

I feel terribly. Like I feel there are only so many times I can tell him, ""I swear it's not you. You are so good. It's all me. I'm anxious."" before it's going to start causing problems. We had the same issue at first when actually having sex, but I was able to focus on just getting lost in his touch, and it turned most of the other thoughts off. I can't do that here.

We have a couple months to go, and I really don't want him to give up because his boyfriend is never into looking at him naked enough to cum.  Or even fucking stay hard.

To all you experienced bottoms out there, when does it stop feeling like you have to take a shit every time you bottom? Is it something I can do to help it? Am I not relaxed enough maybe? 

The deal is, every now and then I really enjoy bottoming, but mostly it just feels like I really need to go number two when he is inside me. It doesn't hurt per se.

We were together for 8 months, and have known each other for 2 and a half years, having dated for 4 months when we first met (we broke up that time because I was in the process of moving to another city for school, it was amicable). He was always so affectionate, sweet, and just all-around good to me, and I can honestly say, I've never been so in love as I was with him, as time went on, the feeling only strengthened. Sure, we had silly little arguements here and there, but we never let them get between us, we loved one another too much for that. We often talked about getting engaged in the not-so-distant future, and referred to each other as ""the love of my life"".

Well, all of that changed the beginning of the week. Suddenly, he was cold and dismissive towards me. I asked him what was wrong, because I didn't want him to feel bad, I wanted to help however I could. After a little while, he blurted out: ""I don't think I love you anymore."" Naturally, I was crushed, confused, and deeply hurt. He didn't wanna hear any of it. Any attempt to express how I was feeling, and questions I had, and attempt to beg him to wait and reconsider or to try and see if we could work through these feelings were met with derision, sarcasm, and unnecessarily cold detachment; one word responses like ""Whatever."" and ""'Kay."" I tried giving him space, but then he, rather confrontationally, told he couldn't not speak to me, and sarcastically asked if I was just going to ignore him. This went on for 2 days. He gave me ultimatums, almost threats: ""if you don't stop talking about this, we're done, is that what you want?"", ""if my feelings don't change by next week, we're done!"", etc. I tried to convey how hurtful and unfair this all was, as I had never done anything to hurt him. Again, he'd only reply with ""whatever"", ""nothing in life is fair"", and when I told him he wasn't acting like his usual self, he replied with ""people change"" and ""I really don't care"". 

Finally, I couldn't take it anymore, so I tried once again, to convey how bizarre and nonsensical and unfair this all was. Again, the usual cold, non-answers were all I got. I asked if there was someone else. He avoided a direct answer and just said ""How would I do that?"". I asked if I had done anything to hurt him. He said ""No, you haven't done anything wrong"". Yet every word he said carried this accusatory, confrontational, aggressive tone. Again, for probably the tenth time now, he told me ""I don't think I love you anymore"", and repeated his unfair ultimatums. Finally, I just told him I couldn't handle this abuse, and that, as much as I hated to, I had to breakup with him; that I couldn't let him hurt me like this. Suddenly, he gets mad at me, as if he were the victim, and I'd done something wrong! Says ""well fine, but don't expect me to ever give *you* another chance."" Says ""I really don't care"" and tells me off. I ask him ""well, what DO you want from me?"" Again, he says it doesn't matter to him and that he really doesn't care. At this point, we basically stopped talking, I couldn't do it anymore.

So, I've been in misery ever since. My energy is gone, my feelings are dead, my sex drive is gone, and I have no desire to even think about dating someone else. And, worse yet, he seems to be fine. Today, I log into Facebook and see he had posted statuses like ""going to bed with a smile on my face, haven't done that in a while"", and something to the effect of ""the one I want has someone else, but oh well, I can wait."" The thought that he's back out there so soon just adds insult to injury. It's stupid, but I felt sick as death almost instantly upon reading these. The thought of him with someone else, and the thought that he really doesn't love or care at all about me anymore just disgusts me, it makes my skin crawl. I just wanna breakdown and cry, every damn day. And even when I sleep, he's there in my dreams, and everything is like I want it to be, despite the fact that I they likely never will be again. I struggle with anxiety and depression, and this has just made it even worse; it's crippling some days. I just feel so drained, so wronged, and so hopeless. And no-one cares, except for me...
