I feel like he was accusing me of deliberately being an unfair cheapskate. And the irony was that he said that he wasn't rich but he gets expensive haircuts, pedicures...it's just a mess.

Story time. I came out at the age 21 and immediately jumped onto Okcupid and tried to find someone. I found my boyfriend after 3 months looking on there, he was 18 at the time and we started seeing each other quickly. He had recently come out as well. We were both virgins and in our first gay relationship but things went fairly well. We moved in after about 9-10 months of dating.
Things went well until about 1.5 years. He expressed concern over the fact that neither of us got to have more dating and sex when we came out. So after a few long talks, I allowed him to have sex with a random guy on Grindr which he did. Luckily for me, it was a lousy encounter for him and things soon settled down.
But again after another year (so 2.5 years into our relationship), he expressed the same concern and interest in experimenting with other guys. We talked about it and he was basically to the point of wanting to break up....so I caved again and let our relationship be an open relationship. So over the past 2 months, he slept with 4 guys and fooled around with a 5th. I, on the other hand, just did not feel comfortable sleeping outside the relationship.
Stress had been high between us so we talked about it again and he wanted to switch to maybe trying to have a threesome instead. We were talking to a guy on Grindr about it and when it got to the point where he invited the guy over, I chickened out. I just did not feel comfortable with it at all.
However, we were talking to a guy on Grindr and he was only looking for friends. I thought he was really nice and seemed fun. So we decided to hang out with this new guy and me and the new guy became fast friends. We talked a lot on facebook and hung out a few times with my bf there. My bf actually started to get jealous and wanted to make sure that I knew that we could only have threesomes. Well later that night, I was talking to the new guy on facebook and we were discussing some things like sex experiences and well, sizes of certain things. We also talked about really personal stories like close friends would do. I kind of knew I was crossing the line talking to someone about that but I never planned on acting on that kind of thing. The next day, I confessed to my bf about what we talked about and he flipped out telling me I crossed the line (which I agree that I did). I had to tell my new friend that we were going to have to slow down and not talk for a while because my bf didn't want me to.
So here's the part where I am conflicted; I kind of like the new guy and it is making me question my relationship with my current bf. Don't get me wrong, I don't want to leave my bf for the new guy, I just met him. I just feel like there are other great guys out there and I wonder if I just jumped on the nearest guy that expressed genuine interest on OKcupid. Plus, I feel like I was used by my bf because he got to have sex with other guys and when I got even close to a friend, he flipped his shit. Granted I see his jealousy right now as the fact that he does care about me some. My boyfriend and I have now closed the relationship again after this experience but I am scared that my bf will come to me again in 6 months and want to bang other guys again. I think me and my bf love each other but when something like this happens, I am starting to look at his weaknesses and faults more than I used to. I feel like I may be falling out of love with him but we have been mostly happy up until now. I want to give it time and think but thinking hasn't helped me after a few days. I am hoping someone with outside perspective can help me here.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys, I posted this on relationship_advice but I thought this subreddit might be able to help as well.&lt;/p&gt;

The reason they need to know is because they've raised me for a majority of my life (10+ years) and since they follow me on Instagram, I don't want it to come as a surprise that I'm into guys if I have a mancrushmonday or a super hot bf (hahahaha yeah right /crie).

And it also arouses anxiety in me because they haven't come out. They are obviously partners, but they say they're best friends (which is not necessarily lying). My sister knows, my whole family kinda knows, but they've never actually said it. 

I care about them, so I want them to hear it from me, I'm into dudes, but I don't know what kind of feelings would arouse in them. I don't care if they don't accept me or something, I'm heading to college I could give less of a shit, but they should know and I need your help bros! How should I approach this? I have dinner with them at least once a week still, so I could just straight up tell them, but I dunno how to expect an answer... I actually don't really know why I'm hesitating. Could you bros help out? Thanks!

TL;DR: Want to come out to important closetted uncles, need help as to why I am hesitating.

Edit: Added TL;DR

EDIT 2: So it seems unanimous, I'll tell them straight up. I think I'm kind of afraid of their emotional reaction because they might be extremely happy and cry and I just can't deal with that to be honest hahahaha

UPDATE: I actually dunno whether to make a new post or something about the update, but I told them and they were surprised hahaha they took it well! I was playing with their dog when I started saying ""soooo before I go to college..."" I paused. ""I wanted you to know... that I'm..."" I hesitated a bit, ""I'm bi-bisexual.""

They congratulated me on knowing who I am before college and were really cool about it. After that though, there was an awkward silence that brought on a 'well, that happened' atmosphere.

We are talking again and he knows that he was the main reason why things fucked up, and he's willing to sit down and have an in depth discussion… at some point… maybe…

I've let go most of my anger, and am starting to go on dating websites again (grindr and okcupid). I'm also going to start seeing a shrink on campus this week.

The problem is though, I feel like total crap.

Nearly every one of my messages on the sites get ignored, and even the ones who responded never got back after the second message. It's making me feel so worthless and like I'll never be able to meet anyone interested in me. I've had one person message me first on OKC, but he ended up just wanting to hookup, and it's virtually only 40+ year old men with fetishes for skinny white boys on grindr.

I can't deal with this shit. I want to move on, but it's making me feel like my ex was the one person who will ever show any interest in me. I keep falling into a trap of thinking I can't move on, and that I should just give up hope of ever dating another person. I've broken down the last few nights because of it.

My ex was the first person who went on more than three dates with me. I went on a date two weeks ago, but the guy left early for ""work,"" and never got back to me. All we did was sit and chat in a cafe for 20 minutes talking about school and work.

I've been feeling so alone, and so helpless. Work and exercising have kept me busy, but I got a bad Yelp review (customer misordered and threw a fit in the shop before I could even offer to fix it), which just sent me over the edge and I started crying in front of my manager, so I'm taking a week and a half off to cool down and stabilize.

I'm seriously about to break down. I don't have many friends to talk to with because I've always been fairly reclusive, but hardly anti-social, due to my shitty upbringing (I was picked on all through K-8, I was abused by my father, my mom's boyfriend wold scream at me for so much as moving the TV remote for years, and my mom was fairly sheltering, so it's hard for me to bond with people at times).

I just need to know what to do to end this terrible cycle.

I want to thank everyone for their advice, it was extremely helpful and I've no doubt I'll be back to pick your collective brains again. I promised to update and, as I have the place to myself for the evening, I'll do just that. I confronted the issue today because I had another sleepless night thinking up nightmare scenarios. It didn't go to plan. It could have gone worse though.

We went for lunch and I started my talk about dating apps. He asked what brought this on. I lied, badly. He accused me of looking through his phone. I denied it. He didn't believe me. I blurted out that I'd heard what I'd heard and I knew what it was and I didn't want him having it. He mumbled ""OK, fine"" and changed the subject. When we finished he said he wanted to walk home and would see me later. I got home and shortly after got a text saying ""I guess you know then. I'm gay. I'm sorry."" I replied saying ""You have nothing to worry about. I love you."" and then a load of ""I'll always love you, I just want you to be happy"" cliches that I had promised myself I wouldn't do but I couldn't think of anything else.

He got back, went to his room for a bit, then came out for dinner and I reiterated all the cliches again and we chatted about stuff. Eventually I get back to the topic of dating apps and say he's not allowed it. There was a bit of protestation that he only talks to people his age and that ""everyone has it"" but I put my foot down and said that it's not safe and that I can and will check the phone anytime I feel like it. I offered my compromises, i.e. that I will happily lat him go to any LGBT event/group for people of his own age and it was begrudgingly accepted.

I kind of screwed this up. I should have waited longer and dealt with it with a clearer mind. That said, I think it could have been worse.

Our second and third dates were even longer. We saw each other for a few weeks and he asked if we could be exclusive. Within another week he used the term boyfriend. He introduced me to his friends and coworkers. 


I was stupidly happy. He is sweet, smart, good looking, and just geeky enough to be cute. Hell I’m a geek at heart too and we have lots of shared interests. We have never fought or really even disagreed on anything. The sex has been good. The only thing I don’t like is he has to travel a good amount for work which is fine. I would feel like a dick if I held that against him, but I do miss him.


Lately he has been traveling more than usual, and where we were spending at least two or three days a week together I have seen him once a week for three weeks straight. Last week I had him over, cooked him a nice meal, had some decent beer, split a bottle of wine, watched The Strain, and cuddled. Then we were both too full and he was too tired from an early morning at work, so we got in my bed and went to sleep.


The next morning we went to have sex, and it was just one of those times you stick it in and it hits something wrong, was too fast, or dry, or whatever, and it just hurts like a bitch. So, that killed that. His dick went limp and my ass wasn’t up for seconds. I apologized, and I tried to get his dick back up to suck. No luck. We cuddled and fondled each other some more and then he had to leave. 


We usually text or Snapchat at least once a day especially when he is out of town, but the last four days or so he has been responding a with only a few words, not answering for 18 hours straight, and only responding selectively. I even gave him a full day of space thinking I’d let him initiate a conversation. I only lasted 36 hours before I caved. He has never been like this. I asked if I could see him Tuesday, because he gets in late on Monday. I still haven’t got a response. 


I don’t like to be passive aggressive and play games, so I ended up sending this: “I really like you, so I am going to be honest. I am feeling kinda neglected right now. If there’s an issue, let’s talk. I would rather address it than loose you.” He sent back: “This is definitely a face-to-face discussion.” I just sent back “OK.” What do you guys think?

Update: I am single. He is about to get supper busy at work and he just doesn't have time to date or so he says. We both said some really nice things about each other, hugged, and went our separate ways. It was the most amicable break up I have ever had. Of course I was cheated on in my last relationship, so by comparison this was actually pleasant. I am supper depressed. I felt like I won the lottery after our first date, and I am not sure my luck will ever be as good again.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok met an awesome guy about three and a half months ago our first date was 5 hours long and amazing.

Went all the way with the boyfriend last night for the first time. I topped and he made noises that keep giving me a semi whenever I remember them today. It was fun, sweet, and hot as hell. But then when he went to finish me off, I just couldn't quite come - it was like he was rubbing my arm instead of my penis. We both had a good time but I couldn't help but feel a little disappointed, because I really wanted to come with him.

A little background is probably in order. I grew up Mormon and only really came out to myself within the last couple of years. This is my first real relationship and last night was my first time on either end of anal sex. However, last winter I kinda hooked up with another friend, and we ended up giving each other head, but I didn't come that time either (neither did he but because of other reasons). I was pretty nervous that time, because it was my first time doing anything sexual ever, but this time I wasn't jittery or anything, just excited.

I have in general no difficulty getting off by myself, but it seems like I can't get off with other people. So, what? Has porn ruined me? Do I have some kind of weird subconscious mental block about sex (esp. gay sex) from my Mormon upbringing? Is this normal for everyone's first couple of times and I just need to get over myself and let it happen when it happens?

I've posted on this subreddit a long time, but this is my first post. Posting on throwaway so there isn't any bias/hard feelings with old posts :)

So, story time, I just had gotten out of a year and a half relationship and wanted to begin dating again after about 2 months. I went on a few dates, all terrible, but then I met someone very normal and attractive (A). We saw each other quite a bit and about 2 weeks later decided to be exclusive. 

Fast forward a month and I go on a trip with a bunch of friends camping and an old flame (B) ended up coming on the trip. We had a short, but fun stint about 2 years before that, maybe a couple of week fling, but I ended it because I was in the closet and nervous about what our mutual friends would think about us, and he was friends with my brother so I didn't want that to be weird for him. Let's just say I've came a long way since then, and am really comfortable with myself and my friends have all been super supportive.

Anyways, back to the story... Everyone ends up having a blast on this trip and I end up hanging out with B and it really brought back a lot of feelings I had back in the day, and the fact that he had his shirt off most of the trip probably didn't help either. We got drunk and I talked to him about said feelings which he reciprocated. In the morning we left for home and we texted back and forth a bit about things but ultimately didn't really decide on anything (he was just starting to see someone, and I've been seeing A for over a month at this point).

So, the dilemma...I like different things about both guys, and now I feel ridiculously guilty for feeling this way. It wasn't like I just developed these feelings for B...they'd been there all along. I saw B again this weekend with a huge group of friends and I found myself trying to make us excuses to talk to him, so I tried to distance myself. Now he is all I can think about. B sent me a snapchat last night with his new guy chilling on the couch and I instantly got jealous. I NEVER get jealous, seriously!

Why I'm struggling?
A: is perfect on paper in every way. Good looking, great job, stable, not stubborn like me so he is extremely accommodating to what I want, so sweet and we like a lot of the same things, but he is extremely Catholic. He is out to his parents for longer than I've been but avoids going to service with them because he won't take communion because you aren't supposed to if you're sinning or something like that, and if he goes with his parents they will know he is having sex/sinning. I make him laugh more than he makes me. A has a great job and makes a good amount of money, and is a year older. I was really into A until B came back and stirred up old feelings. A has a homophobic brother that would NOT let his old BF around his family.

B: good looking, sarcastic, funny, makes me laugh. He is a bit stubborn too, and wouldn't put up with shit, which can be good, but would probably result in us arguing more. I would see a relationship with B being more passionate, but I see us arguing more than with A. B lives with his dad in a huge house, but his Dad was always gone months at a time, so that doesn't really bother me. B is two years younger. Since our weekend I find myself thinking ""what is B up to? What is he doing?"" I've always liked B and he's always liked me but it wasn't until recently that B because a bit more ""grown up"" if you will...job, life, etc etc...

In hindsight, I shouldn't have jumped into another relationship, but I was caught off guard by A and thought I would surely never find someone like him again. I'm sure a lot of you are rolling your eyes and saying ""wow, you're complaining and you have two guys to choose from?"" But I'm just really freaking out because if I continue with A, will feelings for B subside? Or will I always think about what would have happened with B and I would never want to do that to another person. 

I am a good person, and I don't want to hurt either. I've known B alot longer, so there are more FEELINGS right now, so naturally I'm leaning that way, but who is to say there won't be those same feeling with A someday? I don't really think anyone can answer this for me, expect me....but advice would be nice, or if someone has been in the same positions? Outcomes?

tldr - dating a guy for two months, go on a trip with a bunch of friends and reconnect with old flame (didn't know he was coming), Confused about what I should do because I'm having feelings for one more than the other, but that could be the history. Other guy is an awesome prospect too, but doesn't make me laugh as much as old flame.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is a long one guys. I&amp;#39;ve posted on this subreddit a long time, but this is my first post. Posting on throwaway so there isn&amp;#39;t any bias/hard feelings with old posts :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, story time, I just had gotten out of a year and a half relationship and wanted to begin dating again after about 2 months. I went on a few dates, all terrible, but then I met someone very normal and attractive (A). We saw each other quite a bit and about 2 weeks later decided to be exclusive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward a month and I go on a trip with a bunch of friends camping and an old flame (B) ended up coming on the trip. We had a short, but fun stint about 2 years before that, maybe a couple of week fling, but I ended it because I was in the closet and nervous about what our mutual friends would think about us, and he was friends with my brother so I didn&amp;#39;t want that to be weird for him. Let&amp;#39;s just say I&amp;#39;ve came a long way since then, and am really comfortable with myself and my friends have all been super supportive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, back to the story... Everyone ends up having a blast on this trip and I end up hanging out with B and it really brought back a lot of feelings I had back in the day, and the fact that he had his shirt off most of the trip probably didn&amp;#39;t help either. We got drunk and I talked to him about said feelings which he reciprocated. In the morning we left for home and we texted back and forth a bit about things but ultimately didn&amp;#39;t really decide on anything (he was just starting to see someone, and I&amp;#39;ve been seeing A for over a month at this point).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the dilemma...I like different things about both guys, and now I feel ridiculously guilty for feeling this way. It wasn&amp;#39;t like I just developed these feelings for B...they&amp;#39;d been there all along. I saw B again this weekend with a huge group of friends and I found myself trying to make us excuses to talk to him, so I tried to distance myself. Now he is all I can think about. B sent me a snapchat last night with his new guy chilling on the couch and I instantly got jealous. I NEVER get jealous, seriously!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why I&amp;#39;m struggling?
A: is perfect on paper in every way. Good looking, great job, stable, not stubborn like me so he is extremely accommodating to what I want, so sweet and we like a lot of the same things, but he is extremely Catholic. He is out to his parents for longer than I&amp;#39;ve been but avoids going to service with them because he won&amp;#39;t take communion because you aren&amp;#39;t supposed to if you&amp;#39;re sinning or something like that, and if he goes with his parents they will know he is having sex/sinning. I make him laugh more than he makes me. A has a great job and makes a good amount of money, and is a year older. I was really into A until B came back and stirred up old feelings. A has a homophobic brother that would NOT let his old BF around his family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B: good looking, sarcastic, funny, makes me laugh. He is a bit stubborn too, and wouldn&amp;#39;t put up with shit, which can be good, but would probably result in us arguing more. I would see a relationship with B being more passionate, but I see us arguing more than with A. B lives with his dad in a huge house, but his Dad was always gone months at a time, so that doesn&amp;#39;t really bother me. B is two years younger. Since our weekend I find myself thinking &amp;quot;what is B up to? What is he doing?&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;ve always liked B and he&amp;#39;s always liked me but it wasn&amp;#39;t until recently that B because a bit more &amp;quot;grown up&amp;quot; if you will...job, life, etc etc...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In hindsight, I shouldn&amp;#39;t have jumped into another relationship, but I was caught off guard by A and thought I would surely never find someone like him again. I&amp;#39;m sure a lot of you are rolling your eyes and saying &amp;quot;wow, you&amp;#39;re complaining and you have two guys to choose from?&amp;quot; But I&amp;#39;m just really freaking out because if I continue with A, will feelings for B subside? Or will I always think about what would have happened with B and I would never want to do that to another person. &lt;/p&gt;

I knew a guy who I swore was gay, he wore blush and eyeliner, was a real sharp dresser, a gym rat, loved the backstreet boys but he had a girlfriend. We would have deep conversations for hours and eventually one night I tried to make a move on him even though I knew he had a girlfriend and...it backfired! He was just being nice that whole time.

Now there's this other kid who is a friend of my cousin and I met him five years ago when he was only 16 and I was 21 at a party. I was really drunk and talked to this kid for like 3 hours straight and I just remember feeling a connection with him but at the time I wasn't really comfortable with myself and thought he was too young. Five years later I just saw him again for the first time since then and he's grown up nicely. Some of my family and I went on vacation for three days and my cousin brought his friend along. His friend was avoiding me at first and there was some sort of weird tension between us but on day 2 I broke the silence and just started talking to him and then later we talked more on the beach and there was a point where we were trading off friendly insults (teasing would be a better word I guess). I took a shower when we got back and he rushed to get in right after me and I noticed he used my bar of soap to wash himself. Then later he came up to me and said ""So what are you getting into tonight? Are you going to come out with us?"" and while he was saying this he was blushing. I said no because I was still hungover from the night before. All the guys who went out that night bragged about a girl they hooked up with except him, he came back alone. The next day I was at the beach and he told my cousin he was going to come down as soon as he gets up but instead he just abruptly left. I was disappointed and now I'm confused. Was he flirting with me or just being nice? Am I over analyzing this? I don't know if he's gay or bi and if he is he's probably not out. He has a feminine tone in his voice (stereotype, yes I know) and he never bragged about girls the way my cousin and his friends did during the trip. But I overheard some of my cousins talking about him saying he likes talking to people and having conversations with just about anyone.

After moving to Seattle almost a year ago, I have been getting 2 to 3 dates a week - all of which I ditch because of what I figured to be insecurities or high standards.

Then came this guy. Our first date was amazing. We hung out, smoked some weed, walked his Husky around Capitol Hill at 2a.m. and he fell asleep watching an episode of Orange Is The New Black. That was almost a month ago and I have since spent at least three to five nights a week at his house. I love his roommates and his friends are amazing. We went to a barbecue for his coworker and everyone just accepted me and taught me Norwegian drinking games and it was just so perfect and right.

When I am with him, I love the feelings. I literally just sit and stare at his face sometimes. The sex is great, even though I feel like a clumsy first timer. I can imagine an entire lifetime with him. 

When I'm not with him is a different story. I ALWAYS think about him. I find myself questioning whether I have the same feelings he has for me, OR if he has the same feelings I have for him. My mind even wonders to the extreme. Like what if I'm wasting my time? His time? Do his roommates not like me? Am I settling for something less than I'm worth? What am I worth? What is he worth? Should I be feeling stronger feelings at this point in our relationship? It goes over and over and over and over all day.

I cant tell if what i'm going through is purely an anxiety issue, or something that is indicative of a real sexual identity crisis.  Essentially I'm not sure whether the fear and doubt I'm experiencing in social situations is due to the fear of being perceived as gay when i really am not, or if its based on the need to cover up that I actually am. ugh.

This all started from some failed sexual encounters where I got really anxious with girls that I essentially catastrophized in my head.  I began thinking that people would attribute my awkward failure to my the fact that i'm really actually gay. Like on the surface, I have always masturbated to women and straight porn, and a heterosexual relationship is what i want and have always wanted. But some part of me thinks that my failure with women is due to some sort of suppressed homosexuality. So this doubt in the back of my head really fucks with my ability to just be myself and be confident around people. 

So i cant tell whether im being way too hard on myself about getting anxious with girls, or whether i need to accept that im gay (which does not seem very favorable to me, which would essentially force me to adopt a lifestyle that seems foreign and unwanted) 

i apologize if this comes off as insensitive or ignorant, i'm simply trying to sort out whats actually going on with me.
