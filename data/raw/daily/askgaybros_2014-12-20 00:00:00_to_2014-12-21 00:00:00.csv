I tend to be more attracted to women, and so I've mostly identified myself as straight. But I've had sexual experiences with guys throughout my teens and early adulthood, and I do find myself attracted to guys (although I am quite picky apparently). I've hidden the bisexual nature of myself from most - still have never told my family. 

I'm now married to a gorgeous woman and I have children with her. I love her very much. She knows about my past experiences, but I've kept pretty quiet about my bi side.. Until recently

With all the places in the world starting to accept gay, lesbian and bisexual people, I thought it would be OK to be more accepting of my own bi side. I've been slowly just talking about it more with my wife, especially as I have started exploring prostate orgasms. She recently told me, however, that when I talk about being attracted to a guy, or wondering what a real penis feels like that it makes her uncomfortable.  She couldn't describe why - not jealousy, she said. Not ""eww get away"" - but she didn't like to hear it. She said she had to do some more internal searching to find out why it made her feel uncomfortable. She said that maybe it's perhaps because I have been SOOO machismo, so hetero all this time that the idea that I would be OK with a guy sexually is contrary to the image she has of me.

She knows I would never cheat on her with a guy or a girl - that I am loyal and dedicated to her and her alone. She's not worried about that.

I dunno... she's the person I trust most in the world, the one that I am closest to. If she is uncomfortable with me being bisexual and allowing it to be open and free, what would everyone else think? It horrifies me to think of it. I've stayed with it hidden and subdued this long, I could probably continue to do so... but it's felt so free to be.. ME... 

My attraction to men seems to be mostly sexual, because well, I've never had anything more than that in my life. Maybe I'm not truly bi - I don't know. I honestly don't know what I am and what to make of this. I'm a bit old to be having this conflict (35) I know, but I've pretty much compressed it until now, so it's like a new thing for me.

Any advice? I know that if anyone understands this - it's you guys. I honestly went looking for a bisexual forum... but it's almost exclusively female.

So I've been dating my guy for a year, I knew before we started that it would be hard until he came out, but I never anticipated it being this hard.  I love him more than anything, but him being in the closet is just making being together so difficult.  

We've had a rocky few months, which I concede was mostly as a result of my self image and confidence issues added with me unfairly taking my stress out on him.  But we've mostly worked through them, just need to work on my trust again.  But I digress. 

There is one area though that is starting to really take it's toll is that he is still closeted.  He is terrified of coming out, his parents being the biggest worry for him.  I want to help him through it and get him being completely comfortable with himself.  He still struggles with fully accepting he is gay and still tries to carry a straight facade.  I'm still a secret to everyone in his life.  The only people that know we are together are my friends.  

It's starting to get to me a little because it makes having time together really hard to come by.  He has to sneak around his parents.  We very rarely go out in public together.  Our date nights consist of going to dinner in a bit of an out of the way restaurant and going to a movie.  We only ever kiss in public or hold hands under the cover of darkness.  I want to help him accept himself and stop caring what other's think, but I don't want to come across as trying to push him out either.  I have already tried, but being the tactless, blunt asshole that I am it came out all wrong and quite harsh.  

So help me guys.  How can I help my guy come out?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sup guys,&lt;/p&gt;

So, I'm 19 and my boyfriend is 22. we have been dating for a few months. My boyfriend is bi and he has been pretty ok about his sexuality for years, however he recently has started showing signs that he intends to come out to his parents, maybe because I'm mostly fully out, but I'm not sure if that's the reason. However his parents are really homophobic, making homophobic remarks everytime they see news about lgbt people or the subject comes up for other reasons, and every time he tells me of these occurances I can see he is sad about not having any kind of support or safety in coming out to his parents. He is currently living with his parents and has no intentions of leaving anytime soon, since he's planning on getting his master's degree first, so he has to be more cautious so his parents don't expel him out of his home.

What advice do you have to deal with this situation?

A little background:
For a while during and just after high school, I had a crush on a guy in my graduating class named Edmur. I had had crushes before and this one seemed no different. I found him physically attractive, nothing more. After high school, we started hanging out more and more as we frequented the same circle of friends. Eventually, my crush began to grow into something different. I began to fall in love with him. I adored his quiet demeanor, his sense of comedy, his perspective on art, science, politics, not to mention we shared a mutual fondness for ""trees"" and would partake with friends together often.

The dilemma: Edmur being an extreme introvert, I would always be going nuts trying to figure out if he was sad, happy, tired, bored, ect. and to see if there was any way I could help. He's a sphinx, and I felt so helpless not knowing whether being friendly, ignoring him, giving him extra attention, ect was helping or making our friendship worse. I had sent him a letter explaining my feelings and asking for his help in trying to make our relationship less awkward, but I received no response. Now, as Christmas is coming, I'm debating with myself back and forth whether to leave him another letter in his Christmas present about how I loved him and how if he just keeps ignoring me, I'll have to assume that nothing is wrong with how I act around him. I don't want to ruin the gift for him either though, but I hate how our relationship is so awkward to the point where I think he'd rather just not see me at all. I'm so hurt and torn, and I just want to know that he's happy and try to do whatever I can to keep it that way.

TL;DR My friendship with my super introverted friend who I have fallen in love with is so awkward that it's almost like we're not even friends. Do I send him a note in his Christmas present telling him that I love him and that I just want him to be happy?

Recap: got a fuck bud who had a pregnant girlfriend, starting to have feels and unsure if they are mutual. Sex got more intimate. 

UPDATE: people in the previous update seem to have frowned upon the situation that I got myself into and trust me I understand their position. The attention and just genuine want to be in my life he has come to expose in himself is what is drawing me closer to him.

Since last Sunday's post we have hooked up two more times. On Wednesday I picked him up after I had already three margaritas in my system. Me and him finished a bottle of whiskey together. And the intimacy was on full-tilt. We kissed for the first time. Hands touching everywhere. Holding. And the whole shebang. Then tonight we hung out again and our session was more like how it was before the past week. Just really two people using the other person to masturbate.  He told me his girlfriend said she was ok if he fucked around just one woman (or in this case man) and it must end when the baby comes. The bad news is the baby is due middle of January, anyway now really. I'm sadden now I know it will definitely end.

I used to have a closer circle of straight friends, but a lot of them seemed to have drifted away into their own sea of interests like joining frats, chasing girls, smoking weed, drinking and partying etc. I just don't empathize with them on much anymore, and the fact is I seem to be the only one. 

I guess I just feel really lonely at times. I've tried reaching out to other gay people, but it seems many of the gay community also have egotistical pursuits. A lot of them only care about partying and can't seem to pass a day without posting a selfie on instagram/facebook for an ego boost.

I know you see this a lot, I know that I should just stop being a pussy and be ""confident in who I am"" and stuff like that.. But the thing is it doesn't help.. This is somewhat of a rant/me venting. Sorry! 

I'm 17. I'm on the road to graduating High School early, I'm a fairly advanced musician. (Actually I've been conversing with a bunch of Berklee admins! Yay!!) im financially stable, I have great friends and great family. Life is great! But I don't feel good about myself... 

I'm great out in public. I'm great in social situations. I'm confident. I love being the life of the party or the group of friends that I'm with. I love making people laugh. But at the end of the day, when I'm left to myself, I just feel worthless. When I look in the mirror I feel unattractive. I put on this front with everyone that I'm doing great and life is great but behind the mask I just feel like shit. 

I've struggled in the past with eating disorders. Namely anorexia followed By bulimia nervosa (making yourself vomit). I finally freed myself from these evils and I feel like I'm slipping back in. 

I've never had any form of relationship. But I've had TONS of random, meaningless, hookups with guys and girls when I was younger. I try to talk to people. I try to get to know people. And I just get blown off. And it makes me feel even that much worse about myself. I'm not the skinniest guy in the world, I don't have washboard abs, or big arms. I might even have a bit of a soft chest. And I look at these guys that I find attractive and I just shut down. I don't try to get to know them. I don't reach out. How can someone else find me attractive and like me, if I don't even like myself? 

The hell is wrong with me bros? How do I get out of this rut and feel better about myself? 

PS, I didn't write this to get your sympathy patronization.. I just want help and advice. Thanks if youve read all this. Sorry if I seem like a Debbie downer.

I'm a 22yo virgin (including kissing, etc.). Last weekend I was out of town for a job interview, staying in a hotel. I went to a low key bar next to the hotel for a night cap, and met a guy in his 40s who offered to buy my drink, but I figured he was just being polite. He was with a woman so I assumed he was straight and with her, but it turns out they were siblings. We had a short conversation and found out we were staying in the same hotel. I casually mentioned that I was gay and he didn't really react. After last call he invited me to his room for another drink. By this point I was a little drunk and he was certainly more drunk than me. 

So we get up to his room, and he asks if I want to hop in the shower with him and spend the night in a nonsexual way. I decide ""what the hell"" he's pretty attractive if something does happen. We get undressed and hop in the shower. Long story short, he makes the first move and we wind up making out in the shower and getting ""handsy"" for a while. It was really, really nice. He kept saying how hot I was, and I was really flattered. We decide it was time to get in bed and snuggle, but once we did he was out pretty quick. I was a little uncomfortable just laying there with him asleep, so I grabbed my clothes and snuck out.

I guess my question is... is this ""average""? Should I have stayed? Left a note? And is the age difference odd?

tldr: nakedly made out with a guy twice my age, he fell asleep and I left. I was attracted to him but overall a little nervous with the situation. Is this typical of a hookup? PS neither of us got off, we were more focused on just kissing (which was a real learning experience for me :) )","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys, sorry in advance for the wall of text, I just don&amp;#39;t have anyone IRL I can talk with about this. &lt;/p&gt;

I decide &amp;quot;what the hell&amp;quot; he&amp;#39;s pretty attractive if something does happen. We get undressed and hop in the shower. Long story short, he makes the first move and we wind up making out in the shower and getting &amp;quot;handsy&amp;quot; for a while. It was really, really nice. He kept saying how hot I was, and I was really flattered. We decide it was time to get in bed and snuggle, but once we did he was out pretty quick. I was a little uncomfortable just laying there with him asleep, so I grabbed my clothes and snuck out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess my question is... is this &amp;quot;average&amp;quot;? Should I have stayed? Left a note? And is the age difference odd?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tldr: nakedly made out with a guy twice my age, he fell asleep and I left. I was attracted to him but overall a little nervous with the situation. Is this typical of a hookup? PS neither of us got off, we were more focused on just kissing (which was a real learning experience for me :) )&lt;/p&gt;

It's been going really good but Im noticing he's texting his plutonic gay friends a lot more lately, one in particular that he met relatively recently, Greg. I work hard to understand that this doesn't mean anything at all and that the jealously I feel has nothing to do with his actions: it's something I need to work on. 

However, I was using his phone the other day and a text from Greg came in. I know this was a bad move on my part but I started reading up the conversation.... I know... Bad. 

There was nothing incriminating, a little flirty for my taste but again probably just me being jealous. The thing that really threw me off is that he had sent a lot of the same texts to this guy as he did to me the last few weeks. Like pictures of himself, or food, funny things or animals that I thought were just for me (like kind of menial things, nothing super exciting that would merit a mass text to friends if you know what I mean?). I quickly looked at messages to his other close friends and he didn't do the same thing with them. 

Now I 100% trust that he is not physically cheating on me but I cannot help shake the feeling that I'm in competition with this other guy?

 Is that what you bros would think?

We are planning a trip in a weekend and I don't know if I should bring this up as it's kind of sensitive (because I looked at the messages). 

Thoughts? Comments? Concerns? 

I know this is my fault for reading the texts so I deserve this stress but at the same time I wonder if it's smart to just pretend it didn't happen (in case he is side dating this guy-in which case WTF I don't deserve that) .

We have a very loving relationship and I am generally a very level-headed guy.  We see each other almost every day and are accustomed to each other.

&gt;In the past quarter, his ex (of also ~2 years-- the ex cheated on him; they broke up before my BF and I started dating) has come back to town from working in another city and has called him up for coffee every 2 weeks-or-so.  

&gt; I am wondering if this is something I should be weird about or not.  My mentality is telling me that I need to chill, and that it's literally meeting for coffee, but my weak-minded paranoia sometimes takes over briefly every time my BF texts me telling me that he got messaged to meet his ex for coffee.  

&gt;My BF tells me if I'm ever uncomfortable with the coffee meets I should tell him and he'll call them off right away-- he doesn't want anything to impede on our relationship.  I am thankful for his generous foresight, but I never think too much of the meetings for more than they're worth.  Besides, there is no harm in allowing him to befriend people he doesn't mind meeting for coffee.  


&gt;May I get somebody here to tell me to lighten up and grow a pair?  I know my worries are unsubstantiated.   

**EDIT:**  

Hello everybody, and thanks for your previous advice.  I talked to him yesterday about my feelings of unwarranted jealousy, making sure to explain that I do realize that this feeling is over unfounded paranoia and that I have the utmost trust and respect for his decision to meet up with his ex (especially since he lets me know when they meet) and that I trust in his actions for any ordeal like this.  He listened to me explain that I'd like to include myself one time, whenever it may be.. not to keep an eye on him, per se; but to just experience the event so I can squash the unsubstantiated worries.  

That night he mentioned that yes, it was really weird of me to be jealous and reassured me that I had nothing to worry about.  He discussed briefly how my paranoia about the coffee dates me be due to some control issues I may have and I need to keep them in check, as well as telling me to trust him more.  This kinda hit me from the side, but I took it in stride because honestly, I'm sure there are lots of reasons that would get me paranoid over coffee meetups.

Today, that statement hung with me throughout my day whilst at work.  I talked to him about it, explaining how yesterday I enjoyed talking to him about my jealousy pangs and how I realize they are unwarranted-- but I just felt I should let him know that I *did* have these feelings cropping up around the coffee-meet issue.  I brought up how I felt that he left the ball in my court with the previous sentiment of ""I don't want anything to come in-between us-- you can just let me know if it's weird and I can call off meeting for coffee""; and how I felt that was turned up onto me when he said I have control issues in response to my mentioning that I felt a little jealous, worried, and paranoid of things I consciously knew was not occurring.  I really wanted to let him know I fully realize the unfoundedness of my paranoia and that categorizing my jealous pangs under control issues made me feel misunderstood and frankly, crazy.

He replied saying that he was joking and that I should have gotten that.  Oh well.  I believe him, though.  I must have been too caught up in the moment and got woosh'd.

Thanks for reading my update, and of course; thanks for your previous advice.  I think I'll be able to tag along to the next coffee date and sit in some comfy couches :)

I'm in a relationship with a guy who I adore and love. We are vers and switch it up. He is able to cum when fucking me, or getting sucked by me. I can't cum this way with him. 

My first thought is that there is a lack of consistency when he goes down on me. It's a few seconds of amazing head, then nothing, etc. what usually ends up happening is I have to jack myself off in order to cum.
 
My second thought would be me just jacking off alone. However, I don't do it that often (at most, once a week). 

This is making me insecure in the relationship. I want to please him bc I love him and don't want to lose him. I have no trouble getting hard around him. Just finishing it off.
