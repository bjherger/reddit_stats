It took me weeks before I even cried, I just went numb and kept myself busy. I blame myself for not saying goodbye when I had the chance. 

We met in college and started dating he was from out of state. We dated for two years before he needed to move back home and from that point on it worked hard at a long distance relationship with high he and I flying to see each other and a lot of FaceTime and phone calls. One day he called me and said he's had a really bad day and I'd never heard him sound the way he did. He told me he'd call me back as soon as he got home. That call never came and I called high his phone and his family's phone until his cousin called me back and told me he didn't come home last night and Maybe I should give him space. In my mind I thought he'd done something (cheated) and didn't want to tell me or something. For few months I had no contact with him at all and I was both upset and hurt. Then out of the blue I get a call from him.  A call I did not answer (advice from friends) the calls came once or twice a week some with voice mails that I never played... I few weeks go on and his cousin sends me a text asking that I call her the message said ""Jon died last night please call me"" I believed this to be a joke and waited a few hours and then called. It wasn't a joke. She told me he had been in the hospital and didn't want me to know for some reason. The day he called and said he'd had a bad day his doctors told him he wouldn't have long to live. Since I didn't take any of his calls he wrote me a latter that i received  and read after he died. With out getting to much in to the latter it was mostly about him saying he was sorry for not explaining to me that he was sick and that he thought it would have been easier for me if he just stop talking to me and I moved on upset with him but non the less moved on at any rate. Also that he realized in his last few weeks that this was stupid and he just wanted to tell me what was going on with him and say good bye. 

So now I'm here. I feel bad that I never got to say goodbye and that he died before I could. I find myself thinking of him more and more as time goes on to the point I'm depressed most of the time. I guess what I'm writing this for is to ask how do I start to move on or should I be over this already. I feel as if some of my friends are annoyed with because I'm still so sad about it at times.

Thanks to all of you, this whole community is amazing.

So I'm writing something here today because there has been sudden new light into my life. Up to the beginning of last week, I had one of the most boring traumatizing sex life out there. My extremely occasional hook ups would feature myself being extremely nervous, I would be stiff as stone in foreplay and terrorized by actual sex. This mix of emotions would mean I would usually cum with my pants still up, or in more embarrassing cases on my sexual partners seconds after getting undressed. This led to my sexual confidence to be low, I would never go for good looking guys and would always leave feeling more and more depressed. By that point in my life I had never been with the same person more than once. 

This however has all changed last week. In what I would have expected to be the same kind of awful encounter, I have felt feelings I did not even knew existed for the first time of my life. I have experienced the deepest level of comfort in my life with this guy. I have now been with three times, I even slept over this last time. It is incredible how he makes me feel. For the first times of my life I am no longer coming out of nervousness, I have in fact completely annihilated my personal records in terms of stamina. I have felt emotional and sexual connection like never before, I AM GOING CRAZY I HAVE NEVER BEEN ATTRACTED TO ANYONE IN MY LIFE! I just can't wait to see him again! 

But here is the problem, I'm in my early twenties while he is almost thirty… I know he is looking for something serious. I just don't know if he takes me seriously. Hek! I don't even take myself seriously, I for a fact don't know what's out there. I met this guy out of total luck and it happened to change me in ways I did not think possible. I now want to come out of the closet to everyone. I don't want to lose him. But the same time I am now fearless of going after new conquests! But I don't feel like it as what I had was awesome and my low and bad experience tell me it would be hard to find something better than what feels like perfection!

It took me maybe until 12 to grasp the consequences of being gay when I started watching porn habitually and I couldnt get into girls and made that fateful click to male into: ""male"".  But i remember being a little kid even like 7 or 8 and always trying to vie or pry my way into making contact with my friends' tummies.  Or buddying up with the fat kids and encouraging them to eat themselves into a coma, plumping their belly and watching their clothes strain and ride up was the first time I felt wildly sexual, and I think some of my first boners.  

Then I found the yahoo groups, and the art and stories, the website dedicated to round, porky football players, and the warren davis treasure chest.  Ive always known I was into this stuff but its so strange in that I feel like it overrides my sexuality or that it in itself is its own type of sexuality.  It really makes me so crazy horny throughout the day if I catch a cute sexy boy with a round gut who obviously cant control his appetite.  I remember watching pulp fiction as a kid and realizing I was into all the freaky shit and thinking there was something wrong with me.  I wanted the pot belly.  I wanted to be tied up and fed and yikes all kinds of slutty scenarios.  

But I have to be so mild mannered.  My family is very quick to catch on when I start adding pounds, and my friends are relentless because they think im really so hot when im without any hanging fat.  And I hate it.  I dont want to be sloppy huge, but I want a round tummy, something that pokes out of shirts and strains my shorts, where I can let the fur under my navel flip through my finger tips as I grasp below it and take another bite of that ice cream cone.  I think theres a fat kid in me with the mighty power of ten fat kids.

I know all the guys on youtube and grommr on a first name basis, but I always pull away from making a lasting and real friendship because I feel trapped.  Not only do I have to feel like a freak because of the pressures of friends and family, but I dont have the courage to just drop out of my life ive made just for the sake of fulfilling a fetish.  I wish I could say that I had a friend that showed me the light about it, and helped me to become who I want to be, but really ive met the local guys near me and they are not many.  They are also a little unkind, like my inexperience in being gay or my inability to assimilate into gay culture is a stigma.  

I dont want to just do it for the sake of masturbatory self-indulgence.  I want it to mean something and talk to another guy who has the same passions that tingle his bones like they do mine.  I want to know what its like to connect with another person at a level that is very deep to me, and have it actually come through loud and clear and mean something to them.

I cant date even because I think im not being true to myself when Im with a skinny guy who cant eat but half a salad, wears makeup, or is afraid to knock boots at the rough-trader's dive bar that I frequent.  Im rough and tumble and need to be thrown around a bit and wrestle up on a boy and I find the gay community a little tedious.  Sometimes, for example, even the dumb little labels we have come up with for ""describing"" the various shades of ego gay people have are enough to cause verbal warfare and harassment.  I dont know how many groanful times Ive had to endure being told im not a ""bear"".   Im 6'2"" 200 lbs, fuzzy like a kitty cat, and work construction slinging concrete around all day.  Id wear a leather harness and get a paw-print tattoo in a heartbeat: IF ONLY i had a guy to show me that these feelings I had are real and not just deluded illusions of desire gone haywire.  I want what I feel to be real and not a trumped up psychosis stemming from my inability to make any meaningful connection to my gay feelings.

So far in my life I dont think I have one ""+"" column entry, because so much of it was defined as a positive until an insidious betrayal left me massively hemorrhaging my empathy for the human race entirely.  He never loved me, and I languished in agonized depression for years.  Im finally dinging myself back to the surface, and Im no closer to understanding myself.  These feelings I had as a kid that made me feel alive down to my most primal and bestial core are returning (they never left I just chose to defuse them chemically).  Now more than ever I dont want to just tug at my own sausage and pretend like im making an empathetic connection with guys who are just looking for compliments for a fuck on the internet.   

I want to make myself to know myself and be the big guy thats waiting to fill out this body from the inside.  But I need help.  I hate to say it takes another person but does it?  ""putting myself out there"" is often intensely taxing to me especially, because it takes alot for me to re-tune my personality enough to not be such an eccentrically wicked goofball and just act the way people want you to in the gay world.  

Really I want to just ask: does anyone else feel this way?  Any successes?  Where is the light at the end of the pizza box?  Sometimes snoopier guys have foraged my phone on a date or something and gone through my pictures and enough though I know alot of guys are scummy enough to read through another persons phone or go through their personal cameras and SD cards, I still dont delete them or hide them.  I kind of am hoping one day a guy will just be like, ""OH YES"" if he sees them as im looking through my downloads/pictures/camera folder.  I dont think I could ever tell my family, but the gay boy inside of me is screaming out sometimes to just be who I want to be.  I wish I could just have that gut and be the fat friend in my circles.  And I know lots of gay guys are actually affronted by this and react in a mean way, but yaknow lots of gay guys are just actually mean anyways and dont really have anything nice to say and if theres anything I know about myself its that the one thing that I am never failed to be complimented about is how nice and sweet and genuine I am when it comes to others.  

I put in a lot of hard work to express my love for just people, to show them I want the best for them at every turn no matter how small.  But I want to love myself and finally look at myself in a mirror and see the person I want to be and not just a formless slate.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;ive been into it my whole life, even before I really knew I was gay as a kid.

Im rough and tumble and need to be thrown around a bit and wrestle up on a boy and I find the gay community a little tedious.  Sometimes, for example, even the dumb little labels we have come up with for &amp;quot;describing&amp;quot; the various shades of ego gay people have are enough to cause verbal warfare and harassment.  I dont know how many groanful times Ive had to endure being told im not a &amp;quot;bear&amp;quot;.   Im 6&amp;#39;2&amp;quot; 200 lbs, fuzzy like a kitty cat, and work construction slinging concrete around all day.  Id wear a leather harness and get a paw-print tattoo in a heartbeat: IF ONLY i had a guy to show me that these feelings I had are real and not just deluded illusions of desire gone haywire.  I want what I feel to be real and not a trumped up psychosis stemming from my inability to make any meaningful connection to my gay feelings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far in my life I dont think I have one &amp;quot;+&amp;quot; column entry, because so much of it was defined as a positive until an insidious betrayal left me massively hemorrhaging my empathy for the human race entirely.  He never loved me, and I languished in agonized depression for years.  Im finally dinging myself back to the surface, and Im no closer to understanding myself.  These feelings I had as a kid that made me feel alive down to my most primal and bestial core are returning (they never left I just chose to defuse them chemically).  Now more than ever I dont want to just tug at my own sausage and pretend like im making an empathetic connection with guys who are just looking for compliments for a fuck on the internet.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to make myself to know myself and be the big guy thats waiting to fill out this body from the inside.  But I need help.  I hate to say it takes another person but does it?  &amp;quot;putting myself out there&amp;quot; is often intensely taxing to me especially, because it takes alot for me to re-tune my personality enough to not be such an eccentrically wicked goofball and just act the way people want you to in the gay world.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really I want to just ask: does anyone else feel this way?  Any successes?  Where is the light at the end of the pizza box?  Sometimes snoopier guys have foraged my phone on a date or something and gone through my pictures and enough though I know alot of guys are scummy enough to read through another persons phone or go through their personal cameras and SD cards, I still dont delete them or hide them.  I kind of am hoping one day a guy will just be like, &amp;quot;OH YES&amp;quot; if he sees them as im looking through my downloads/pictures/camera folder.  I dont think I could ever tell my family, but the gay boy inside of me is screaming out sometimes to just be who I want to be.  I wish I could just have that gut and be the fat friend in my circles.  And I know lots of gay guys are actually affronted by this and react in a mean way, but yaknow lots of gay guys are just actually mean anyways and dont really have anything nice to say and if theres anything I know about myself its that the one thing that I am never failed to be complimented about is how nice and sweet and genuine I am when it comes to others.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put in a lot of hard work to express my love for just people, to show them I want the best for them at every turn no matter how small.  But I want to love myself and finally look at myself in a mirror and see the person I want to be and not just a formless slate.&lt;/p&gt;

First off: I absolutely did not know he was underage at the time. He claimed to be 18 from the very beginning (and still does).

We live in Canada. I'm in my mid-twenties. 

This actually happened several months ago (beginning of summer). A guy messaged me on a hookup site looking for, well, a hookup! He had multiple profiles, some saying he was 19, some saying he was 18. Some sites set your age based on your birth year (even if you were born in, say, December) so I figured this was just a case of that.

We chatted for a bit and then eventually met up, but before I even saw him that first time, he made sure I was OK with him being only 18 (asking point blank). 

We fooled around on several occasions. Then I was away from town for a few months.

Cut to now, I'm back in town and he has begun messaging me again. We have not met back up again yet.

My curiosity got the better of me and I decided to do some poking around. It turns out he gave me a completely fake name (both first and last) but after some sleuthing I was able to find his Facebook profile.

It turns out he just started the 11th grade this September. This would mean he was born in 1998 (unless he was held back or something). 

When I found out, I was sick to my stomach and threw up in toilet. 

I've been frantically searching around the web to find out about consent laws and just how much shit I could potentially be in. 

From what I've read, the age of consent in Canada is 16. I don't exactly understand this because everything you see (hookup sites, Craigslist, porn sites.. etc) use 18. If the law is 16, why not lower the requirement for those sites?..

Now when we met up he did look young, but not young enough to make me think that he was lying -- he has facial hair (which I didn't get until I was 20).

One of the reasons I agreed to meet up in the first place was because in our rural small town area, the overwhelming majority of guys on gay hookup sites are 40+. Finding somebody closer to my age was what I was going for. He messaged ME first.

So, I've been making excuses to not see him when he messages me. 

I don't know what to do with the situation. Do I confront him about his age? Or take the safest route which is to avoid contact with him completely until he just loses interest.

On that note, I know he's been meeting up with older men from these hookup sites (or so he claims). I believe him.

Maybe I'm crazy, but _I'm_ the one who feels violated right now. His lie put _my ass_ on the line and I could get into a lot of trouble. He also knows where I live (although he's never been to my place before).

He has no idea I know exactly who he is.

Should I be getting a lawyer?

I&amp;#39;d have to say a musician that I look up to would be &lt;a href=""http://www.metalsucks.net/2012/03/29/rigged-luke-hoskin-of-protest-the-hero/""&gt;Luke Hoskin&lt;/a&gt; of Protest the Hero, and &lt;a href=""http://www.metalsucks.net/2011/05/25/8-a-j-minette-the-human-abstract/""&gt;A.J. Minette&lt;/a&gt; because they are amazingly talented and add something unique to their genre (metalcore, prog, etc.)
My music crush is definitely &lt;a href=""http://websta.me/n/brandonburkhalter""&gt;Brandon Burkhalter&lt;/a&gt; because reasons...&lt;/p&gt;

I see both of my friends at least once a week. My gay friend I asked why I haven't met his bf he just said this is our day to hang.

There are so many beginner routines out there its kind of overwhelming... like how do you know which one will work for you? How do you know which size weights to start with? lol

Also a lot of the guides out there dont really demonstrate what the movements look like...
If someone could direct me to guides with gifs/images/vid clips demonstrating proper lifting techniques...that would be great

I'm 21 and am having some issues with my weight. I for the majority of my life have always been a bit over weight and I am really frustrated by it. I am 6'1 and weigh about 240lbs. I have a large frame but would like to feel a little more confident about my body as a whole. My boyfriend says he likes me the way I am but I would like to loose some weight to have a little more self esteem in my appearance. 
I am also a super busy college student who doesn't really have a lot of extra time. Any help would be appreciated.
