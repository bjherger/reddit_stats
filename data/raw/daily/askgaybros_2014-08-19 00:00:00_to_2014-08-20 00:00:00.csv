Like many, I am a long time lurker but first time poster here. I've recently got put in a situation where I really don't know what to do. So I'm visiting home for a couple weeks, and I meet this guy online. We chat then text, and everything's going supremely well (best connection I've ever had with someone I met online). He's the epitome of what my perfect guy is, in looks and in personality. We plan to meet in a few days time. 

We snapchat back and forth, and one day he commented on how nice my skin looks - I tell him that it's all lighting (which it is, as any adept selfie-taker knows) and that my skin is far from perfect. He replies that it looks pretty good to him. 

My skin has long been a huge source of self esteem issues for me. Thankfully, my skin cleared up almost completely when I moved away for school and the pictures on my profile were taken there, so it's not like I'm putting pictures out there that don't look anything like me. However, the climate where I go to school is quite different than that of my home, and I've been breaking out pretty bad in some areas of my face and neck over the past week. I am seriously considering not meeting up with this fantastic guy with whom I have insane chemistry with, because I'm scared he'll take one look at my skin and call the whole thing off.

I have no idea what to do right now, because I like this guy and want to meet up with him, but I'm scared. I'm trying everything I can right now (masks, face washes, changing pillowcases every night and drinking tons of water), but to no significant improvement in appearance.

I go to a large and very liberal school, so I am openly gay and there's quite a few openly gay people who are RAs. For those of you who've been RAs, you probably know that some of us (all of us?) go pretty hard during training before school starts a few times. Drinking, some pot, loudness. Things we have to pretend we are against when the other students arrive.  
  
Anyway, I was hanging out with this one guy, who I didn't know was gay or bi. We were just hanging out after I had been partying for a few hours. I know for a fact he was sober because I remember everyone coaxing him into drinking and he said he doesn't drink. He's a lot taller than me and isn't jacked but is built along with some fluff. In other words, I was definitely attracted to him but I was so fucked up. The last thing I remember is he had his arm around me while we say (fully clothed) on his bed. That's the very last thing I remember. I was blacked out for the rest.  
  
Anyway, I woke up extremely hung over, confused, and naked. I knew I had been fucked because my ass was wet (I figured it was lube/Santorum). He was still asleep so I just grabbed my clothes and ran to my room. I just say in my room all day today unsure of what to do. I didn't shower or anything yet because I know you're not supposed to, but I'm conflicted.  
  
Here's why. I texted him saying we need to talk and that I'm confused about what happened last night. I asked him what we did because I knew he was sober and all that. He sends me this text: ""dude, don't even try to at the rape card. you look plenty happy in this."" and attached is a video. I hit play. It's me getting fucked doggy style. He is NOT wearing a condom and he is saying ""you like that, bitch?"" and I actually am saying ""yeah, fuck me"" and I'm moaning and early enjoying myself.  
  
I don't know what to do...if I go to the police...he has evidence that makes it look like I consented. And I was so drunk...maybe I really did try to get him to fuck and he accepted my advances. I don't know what happened last night, but he was 100% sober. I'm thinking of saying I was raped by a stranger so I can get the PeP (I forget the acronym) thing and a kit done. He did cum in me...like I said, I still haven't showered.  
  
I haven't eaten or showered or anything today. I'm afraid to go out into the hallway in case I see him. He didn't even come check on me or see if I was okay after I texted him even though we live on the same floor.

I'm hoping you all are able to help me out here. 

I'm 24 years old and I'm 100% sure that I'm gay. I've known I was gay since I was about 10 years old, meaning that when I was 10 I used the word gay to describe myself. Accepting that I was in fact gay wasn't an issue, being comfortable telling other people was. I told everyone when I was 22. So, I've had quite a bit of time to deal with my sexual orientation. Cool. 

Here's where it gets weird though. I've always had some sort of friends, but when I think back, they have always happened because other people made an initiative... Or maybe it is mutual, I don't know, but I'm under the impression I wasn't someone who pushed for those friendships. I think I may have been actually reluctant or hesitated to make friends because I wasn't fully okay with people finding out who I really was, for fear of being lonely. I only ever made friends when they showed interest in hanging out, and only after that did I tell them (once we had already formed a connection).

Now it's the same exact story. Friends are hard to come by, and the only people I'm 100% comfortable making friends with are gay guys now days.  In the past, I've always gotten along best with other guys, and I've never really had any friends that were girls. Now, I'm just not making friends with any guys or girls, unless they are gay of course. It just feels like I have 1000 times more confidence making friends with gay guys, than I do with straight men or women. 

So here's the real rub, I guess: 

I like being able to talk about my boyfriend, and have honest conversations with people, but I feel like my straight friends always get silent around me or they don't really care to hear about someone important to me. I'm not one of those people who speak about inappropriate things, so it's not that. They're totally okay with homosexuality and all that on paper, but the sentiment I get is that it makes them feel awkward. Any time new people start getting friendly with me, I put up a wall, because I don't want to experience the frustration that I am experiencing with my friends right now. I want to feel normal when I talk about things and people (like my boyfriend) that are important to me. I totally don't feel comfortable talking about it with any of my existing straight friends right now, and it's probably because they seem uncomfortable discussing it. I can't form any close friendships with them anymore, because it wasn't like when I was single and had no boyfriend or dates to even talk about. 

It's like I have to hide that part of my life again, even though they know I'm gay already. I hate it. I really want to be able to make friends with people of all sexual orientations, genders, races, etc... but I can't, because I'm just exasperated with it all right now. I've essentially given up any hope on making new friends that aren't gay. There's nothing wrong with that, except I feel like I'm missing out because my social circle is no longer diverse enough. Gay people and I just click in a way that I used to with my straight friends. I have zero issues approaching gay people and making good friends. It comes so naturally that it kind of scares me, because I don't know *how* I manage to do it. Complete opposite when someone I perceive as straight (man or woman) tries to befriend me. I shut down, and sometimes they manage to push through and get to know me better, but I still never initiate any hanging out or conversation, because like I said I'm exasperated with it all. Sometimes it fizzles out completely, and then nothing new comes along for several years. 

I don't exactly know what question I wanted to ask you guys, or what I even need from you all. Please help.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys, I have an interesting problem, but it&amp;#39;s most likely not unique.

I have been with my boyfriend now for about 2 years. He was the first guy I did anything with. I lost my virginity to him when I was 21, but prior to that I had spent years being down and depressed about being single and lonely. It was so bad that I was registered to websites like Manhunt and the like and I would talk to guys and arrange to meet up, but because I was so nervous and inexperienced, I never went through with it. I thought I'd be happy with a boyfriend.

However, lately, I've been having huge doubts. I've decided I don't want to be with him for the rest of my life. I love him and I'd like to be friends, but deep down, I just want to fuck other guys. Now I've had sex and seen what it's all about, I don't feel nervous anymore. Lately I've been having fantasies about sleeping with other men and exploring my sexuality, but when I mentioned this to my boyfriend, it did not go down well. We've always been really open with eachother so I guess I naively thought that he'd be happy to discuss it with me, but he was really angry. I wanted to explain that ultimately, I just love men and dicks. I never wanted to tie myself down to one man, it just sort of happened that way. But that would have definitely just made things worse so I brushed the whole thing off and just said it was a hypothetical 'what if I get bored' situation. 

But it's not, I really do want to just jump on Grindr and hook up with a load of guys. I want to go to gay clubs and have a one night stand, I just wanna fuck a bunch of men, I wanna have a threesome, I want more than one notch on my bedpost for my entire life. I have a secret twitter account where I follow loads of other gay guys and I see various groups of gay men all fucking about with eachother, having fun. I want that. Things are OK with me and my boyfriend, we're going through a bit of a stagnant patch, we're arguing a bit because I have a job and he doesn't and neither of us have friends where we moved to, so we do get a bit sick of seeing only eachother, but even if those weren't issues, I just don't think I'm happy in a relationship. I feel so conflicted because he loves me, and I used to love him way more, but now not so much. I know he loves me more than I love him, and I feel awful that I don't feel the same. When we discuss our relationship he even says ""I can tell you don't love me, but wait till I get a job, things will be different"" - but I don't want to wait, I know nothing will change. I just don't feel like my heart is in it anymore. I know the answer is to break up with him, but:

a) I don't know how, I've never been in a relationship. If he can tell I don't love him, why when I come out with horrible truths like 'I want to fuck other guys' does he not let me go? I've pretty much admitted I want out, but he doesn't seem to care/notice. How do I tell him?
b) I want to hear more than 'just break it off'. Am I horrible? Am I in the wrong? I lurk in Gaybros a lot and I get the feeling a lot of people are going to say 'relationships are great, so much better than being promiscuous, don't throw love away' etc. But that's not true for me. I'll have a relationship one day, and it's a shame I didn't meet this guy a few years from now because we'd be great together. But I know my feelings won't go away, my deep down sluttiness I guess. 

So... what are your thoughts?

EDIT: I should add, I downloaded Grindr last week and I've been chatting with some guys. I know, I'm an awful human being, but I've decided if I do do anything, it'll have to wait until the relationship is over. The worst part is, not even because I feel bad about cheating (I wouldn't be human if I didn't want to have my cake and eat it). The main reason is because I'd never risk giving him a second hand STD, I don't want one myself, but I figure with hook-ups it's something you need to take in to account.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey gaybros, I have a dilemma and it&amp;#39;s been getting me down.

Anyways, the guy is REALLY endowed and I was scared I wasn't going to be able to bear it. Like, I don't know 8.5 inches, something like that... really huge, it was astonishing. 

I was able to get it inside of me without much trouble, he prepped me really well, I was relaxed and stuff. 

But, once he was fully inside of me, when he started the in-and-out movement, it felt like he was hitting a wall or something, like there wasn't space for him to slid though and it really hurt! I couldn't bear it, nevermind feel pleasure. We tried different positions, nothing worked!

I wanna try it again, and so does he. Does any of you guys have any idea of what could have gone wrong? 

long story short: loosing my virginity, his penis seemed to be punching something inside of me and it really hurt, no position changed this and it seemed it didn't have any room to slide freely.

Thanks!

**EDIT:** You guys are awesome! I posted this a few hours ago and you already came up with several different answers! Thank you sooo much! I still don't know if I found the ONE thing that's causing the pain, but I already have a lot of things to look after and a lot of what you said made sense!

I'm going to keep this as short as possible because it's nerve-wrecking writing this at work. My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 3 years and we've had our fair share of problems. He is absolutely convinced that I've cheated on him and the only two things I've done wrong are:

1) Went to dinner with a friend who liked me. That said friend kissed me and I told my boyfriend because I felt horrible about it.

2) Visited my ex before he moved to NYC because I would never see him again. Nothing happened. 

3) Drunk texted guys on Grindr after my BF and I had a fight. Nothing happened. I may have led people on but that's it. 


So, my boyfriend has actually sexted a ton of guys twice in the past and I've been paranoid about him cheating on me. I'm 85% sure he's cheated on me but I have no physical proof. 

We haven't really gotten along very well but we do love each other. He recently has had some depressing things happen in his life so I'm trying to give him his space but it's hard when we live together. I'm also going through a lot myself with some medical issues, so it's been extra stressful. We both just have a lot of stress. 

I recently went out of state for vacation to a place I thought I wanted to live. However, after coming back, I realized home is wherever my boyfriend is. It took a big trip to my dream place to realize that it meant nothing without my boyfriend.

And so, he's out of town right now. We got into a huge fight over text which was not my intention and he keeps telling me he's not sure what he wants. I get the feeling that he's pushing more towards the ""I want to be single"" side and I think it's either because he's so stressed or he's actually talking to someone else. Either way, I don't feel like he wants to stay and work through things. He's actually being really mean lately - putting me down and saying things like ""I'm high-maintenance"" and he has no patience for it anymore. 

Today, I got this sinking feeling in my chest and I never get this. However, It's the feeling that translates to ""It's coming to an end,"" so I started shaking at work and almost broke down during a client meeting because I don't want it to to be over. I love him SO much and would do anything to keep him in my life. He's literally my best friend and my boyfriend. 

There's all of this fear and I also feel really angry. I just don't know what to do. The idea of him being with other guys makes me upset and I have no idea how to cope.

I'm literally on the verge of a furious-rage-upset-breakdown. 

ADVICE?

So first things first I am bipolar and in my case it does -crazy- things to my sex drive. Some days I will not want sex of any kind and the very thought makes me uncomfortable. Other days I want cock everywhere all day. This can make things a little weird with a boyfriend who doesn't live with me because sometimes I'll be in one of my anti-sex moods when I finally get to see him. Other times it's great and we have great sex.

But one thing that's been bugging me for a while, which I've ignored until now, is a third mood where I guess I get ""bored"" sexually and just want to sit alone with porn and edge for a few hours, even if my BF is there. I've tried watching porn -with- him and it's kinda strange and I don't think I like it.

But here's the part I'm worried will make me seem like a horrible person. I think the reason I sometimes watch porn is that I get bored with his body. He is sexy and I love him but no matter how many different positions or activities we try it's still the same body. The same way I would get bored if I only watched Austin Wilde porn for a month straight and go looking for something different. It's not about not being attracted or not loving my man it's just that I need something completely different now and then you know?

In case you are wondering no I have -not- cheated on him and I -never- will. No matter how crazy my manic episodes get I will have a lot more self control than that. But the fact that sometimes I think in my head that I would prefer to watch porn by myself that day than have sex with him makes me feel like a bad guy, like as if it's -almost- cheating even though we are both very porn-positive and I don't know what to think.

I've seen people around here express similar opinions except not with porn, they seek an open relationship and people jump all over them and say that they just want to be a slut and still have someone all to themselves, and I really don't think that way at all and I think that's why an open relationship hasn't even occurred to me, plus because no matter what it always sounds like 'you're not enough for me' even if that's not how I feel at all! That and even though when I watch porn I do fantasize about being involved but I think everyone does? So it's not the same as wanting to cheat I guess? 

I'm just really confused and I think part of it is the bipolar skewing everything so I have trouble figuring out which of my feelings are bad or not. :( I've also never been in a relationship for more than like two months except for this, which has been a year and a half and I don't want it to end any time soon so I really don't want to jeopardize this. I really hope there are some bipolar bros out there who have had the same sort of experience, or even bros without bipolar who have felt like this, and help me sort out what I'm feeling and figure out what to do, because having these thoughts and not knowing which are okay and which are bad is really stressing me out and pulling me down","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to come across looking like a bad guy here but I might. :/ Anyways I hope some of you can relate and give some advice as to whether this is an okay thing to feel?&lt;/p&gt;
