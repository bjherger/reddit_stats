So here's the deal : met this guy on grindr around mid may, we got along right away texted pretty much non stop for the first week, we both say we are looking for serious LTR, have tons in common and actually go on 3 dates with no sex involved at all! Then we get a chance to spend a weekend alone at my place, I go pick him up we spend the day together, we sleep together and have amazing sex. Up to that point everything is going perfect but the next day i go drop him off at his place and from that point he starts being distant; not texting much and sometimes no answer at all yet I can see him online on grindr/facebook etc. after a few days like this I ask him if everything is okay, that if he didn't like me as much as he tought he would that's fine but I'd just like to know. He answered that it's not the case he is still interested and he's just being busy... I haven't seen him since, we made plans 5 or 6 times after that but he always comes up with esxcuses to bail out at the last minute and then dissapearing for hours. I tried to just go over this and keep talking with him, trying to be a bit kinky saying I'm horny and want him and stuff like that, his answer? that I should go get laid with some random guy, after all we are only ''seeing'' eachother which mean we can do as we please... The part I don't understand is why is he still talking with me? We don't text as much but we do talk everyday, he got a private server (he has to pay for it) for a game so we can play just us together, he still wants to make plans, like this sunday we're supose to go for coffee... So I'm just confuse, any of you guys been in this situation? I'd especially like to hear about guys that were in his position; why would you still be texting someone and yet not see them? Do you guys think I should just back the hell out of this situation?

Edit : I'd like to add that I'm the kind of guy that gets attach really quickly which is why I'm thinking about backing out cause I don't want to be hurt. The way I see this is if he was really interested wouldn't he make it happen so we could see eachother? I understand somethings can come up at last minute and you have to cancel plans but I have a job and family too yet I can manage to find time for him, shouldn't he do the same?

Thanks in advance for any advises or feedback guys and sorry if my English is not good =/! I use throwaway because I think he might be on reddit, not too sure haha!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi guys!&lt;/p&gt;

This guy has been my best friend for about four years, and we do everything together. I've always wondered about his sexuality (in fact up until now I thought he was almost asexual, because even at 14, 15, 16 years old he never talked about anything remotely of that nature). I figured that if he were gay he would have told me, especially since he was one of the first people I told when I came out at 16.

But the other day we were hanging out when he asked me to put on some music on his laptop. As I was switching through the apps on his computer, I scrolled past a tab where I saw mutual friend's—let's call him Tommy's—name pop out multiple times on the page. I usually try not to snoop (my friend is a creative writer and he tends to leave his compositions open on his computer, so I usually respect his privacy when using it), but I was curious. In the short paragraph that I read my friend described an encounter he had had with Tommy and talked about their secret relationship in general (e.g. the ways they communicate in groups of people).

I have been taken aback and I can't help feeling kind of hurt over the whole situation. On the one hand, I understand very well that all guys come out on their own time, but on the other, I feel upset that my openness with him (not only about my sexuality, but many other things as well) has been met with secrets. I'm upset with myself too, because now I think maybe I did something that made him not want to tell me in the first place.

Tommy, by the way, is very out and was way more open about his sexuality than even I was in high school. I would like talk to him about this, but I would feel very uncomfortable going behind my friend's back (not to mention the awkwardness in asking Tommy—who had some feelings for me throughout much of high school—about his relationship with my best friend). 

Gaybros, what should I do? Should I tell my friend that I saw his note (again, on accident)? Should I, when we're all hanging out, casually bring up the subject or say that I've noticed them looking at each other? Or should I just pretend that I didn't see the journal entry at all, since my friend will tell me when he's ready? 

All advice is appreciated. 

**TL;DR - I saw on my friend's laptop that he is seeing a friend of ours who used to like me.

All I know at this point is that I'm not hetero. I feel a lot of people whose stories I've read know from a young age or know with a great deal of certainty that they are gay or bi or what have you, and while I know this isn't always the case, for me it's a lot less clear cut.

Basically, recently I finally started admitting to myself that I wasn't straight, and thought I was bi - while I have mostly gotten off to gay porn while masturbating and have a lot of interest in guys, I sometimes would get off to straight porn and still find some women attractive, just far less frequently than with men.

In high school I had a few relationships with girls and we had really strong emotional connections but didn't really do much sexually. Then with this one guy friend of mine I ended up having a pretty sexual relationship for awhile before a bit of a falling out, but never really connected emotionally. That being said, I can see myself having an emotional and sexual relationship with a guy, so that's not really a problem.

So as it stands now, I feel kind of lost with how to identify (I also hate labels in general but sometimes feel they are useful for other people to understand you, since so many people adhere to them strictly). While originally (last year and earlier this year) thought I was just bi, I think it may have been me just hoping I wasn't ""completely"" gay. But lately, I have realized that I haven't really gotten off to any girls (in porn or real life) and have been spending a lot of time focused on guys, so I think I might just be gay. I don't know how to explain all of my thoughts better, I hope that I communicated that well.

I want to come out and know who I would tell first and everything, and I don't think there would too much of a backlash, but I'm scared that if I come out as gay I'd be limiting myself, and if I'm just in a ""gayer"" phase of a fluid bisexuality it could complicate things... Any advice?

My other question stems from the fact that I just got back home to Minnesota for the summer but I go to college on the east coast. While this provides some benefits (like being able to come out to my college friends while having a larger degree of separation from people I don't want to know right away), it also means that the people I want to come out to first are really far away. I wish I could tell them in person, but don't know if I want to wait another 3 months before I see any of them again. I'm finally coming to terms with everything and just want to talk to somebody about it I guess, and 3 more months of stewing in my own head seems like torture. Any advice for how I could overcome this? Should I wait, or tell them over skype/phone/text or something? :( Thanks for reading and sorry for the long post.

**TL;DR** Don't know if I'm gay or bi or what but feel like I have to pick a label for coming out to simplify the whole process. I just got home to the Midwest from my college on the East coast but want to come out to school friends, don't know how to go about it.

I immediately wanted to go, because I got butterflies at the thought of spending all day with him...until he explained to me what they had planned.

1) morning (11am-ish) meeting at brunch (bottomless mimosas).  He warned me they push the bottomless to the limit.  Oh God, that's too early to drink.

2) after brunch they are going to a ""daydrinking party.""  *More* drinking? Ok.  I guess I can handle this.

3) Back to his apartment (it's a really nice place) to drink on his porch/play pong/pregame.  I can't do this at this point...

4) Going out that night.  (Yeah, if I'm not fucking dead from alcohol poisoning.)

I thought maybe he was exaggerating/trying to talk up his drinking, so I asked a mutual friend, who confirmed he and his friends drink a lot and get really drunk.  I also once asked him how drunk he gets when he goes out and he was really nonchalant about it, like ""haha I dunno I black out a lot.""

I'm pretty distraught right now as I think I've just simultaneously ruined a relationship and friendship. Up until about 6 months ago I was convinced I was straight. Had a girlfriend and everything. I had been occasionally curious about guys, but really nothing more than random thoughts. 6 months ago, my friendship with my best friend really started to develop and grow deeper. He's 21 as well, openly gay, and also one of my roommates. 

When our friendship started to strengthen 6 months ago, I began to get feelings for him. It scared the crap out of me. I tried to play it off as just a bromance, but I legitimately started to fall for this dude. He's honestly the perfect person. Kind, funny, intelligent, attractive. I am deep down a little jealous because I think a part of me wants to be him. As time went on, my feelings got stronger for him. At this point he and I would occasionally sleep in the same bed. It started out as an accident, but the next morning we both laughed at how it was nice to sleep next to someone and ended up making a habit of it. 

One night I decided to tell him how I felt. He confessed that he was starting to get a crush on me too. He said that things between us would go at my pace. He didn't want to rush anything and he didn't want to develop more feelings for me since we didn't know if this was just a phase or not. We talked for a while about our friendship, and eventually I kissed him. We made out for a while. It felt so right. As time went on we fell in love. Even said the ""L"" word to each other.

Problems started to come up once things got more physical. I knew he wanted to be physically intimate. I tried. I really, really tried. At first I was ok with things but then I started feeling guilt and shame. I don't know how else to explain it other than I just couldn't do it. It kind of made me feel gross. He was so patient with me. He said he was willing to put off the physical stuff and just do what I was comfortable with. We cuddled, held hands, kissed quite a bit, but I couldn't do anything more than that. 

As time went on, even the kissing started to make me feel uncomfortable. I still loved him, I just couldn't get physical with him. I think he could sense that something more was wrong. He sat me down and said he wanted more. At this point, he was the only one in the relationship initiating things. I would almost avoid being alone with him because I knew I couldn't give him what he wanted. He was the only one showing affection, putting a hand on my leg or playing with my hair while we sat on the couch. I didn't do any of that because I knew it would lead to more. While we talked, he was obviously heartbroken. I told him all of this and he wanted time to process everything.

He went home for a week yesterday. We are supposed to talk again next week when he gets back. I told him that I still want to try and make this work. I legitimately love him, but I don't blame him at all for wanting more in a relationship. Since I still want to try this, it's all up to him. He said he's 50/50 right now.

How bad did I mess this up? What I felt for him was real, but he was adamant about moving things at my pace so he didn't get over involved. I feel awful because I know I hurt him. How would you guys react to this? Would you stay in the relationship and try to make it work or cut things off completely? Is it even possible for him to be friends with me if he ends it? I'm pretty upset about this and feel terrible. I think he believes I led him on and maybe to some extent I did. I just don't know what to do. Sorry for the novel, but I'd be grateful if someone could shed some light on this.

EDIT: I brought up the idea of an open relationship. He could get the physical release he needs, but at the same time staying with me. I don't really have much of a desire to do anything sexual (with a guy or a girl) right now so the open relationship would only be for him. He wasn't crazy about the idea but said he'd consider it.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys, 21 year old college student here.
