So as it's titled, I feel quite awful.. I slept with someone I shouldn't have. It was my good straight friend, who has a girlfriend.

We're both 23 and he's been one of my good friends for a few years, throughout most of college. We have a group of straight and gay friends that we regularly hang with,

At the beginning of last fall though, he started to come on to me. He was single then, and one thing led to another and we were having a little romance. It sort of went away without any formalities, we just became busy with school and work, but stayed friends, always hanging out.

A few months later he began a serious relationship with a woman. I was happy for them, she was also one of our friends and our past wasn't something that was secret, but it was kept private. So his new role as straight boyfriend was not something that I felt was awkward for our friendship. 

It was this summer though, when the girlfriend would be out of town, that he would start coming onto me again. It was sexual and aggressive but smooth and endearing... and I started to feel things for him more powerfully than before. BUT, I never caved, I never went home with him, never kissed him, never gave into him.

This was until his girlfriend moved to France, where he'll join her in a few months. She left a few days after halloween, a night when, like clockwork, he was wanting me. The following weekend he had me. 

I went home with him after being at a gathering with our friends, where we were very intoxicated. He was giving me an extraordinary amount of attention and physical affection, and I could no longer ignore him.

I tried to treat the situation the ways I always had, turning him down with vigor, taking the high road, not allowing myself to get in the middle of a hetero relationship. I was doing a good job, but I was much more intoxicated than normal and the party was getting smaller as his intentions were getting stronger. 

Then he kissed me. I told him to stop, but he didn't and I was his for the taking. It felt so wrong, I felt like I let myself down and these morals I projected upon us were shattered. I've kissed him before, and I still wanted to kiss him every time he came onto me, but I never did, due to the girlfriend. I always wanted to be better than him. But eventually I wasn't.

We went to his house, did the deed, he told me how ""special"" I was to him, and how he wished things were different about his situation with his girlfriend. I called bullshit, but it felt so great to hear in the moment. 

He was great the next morning, made me breakfast, treated me right. It was like we were still in a euphoric high from all the built up sexual desire of the past months. We accepted what happened and continued the day living with our decisions, choosing not to dramatize the situation. I felt like we still somehow respected each other. 

But now, he is cold. When we're around our friends he is short and actively shuts me down, ignores me when I'm talking and treats me like he doesn't know me. 

I feel very violated, used and mistreated. Its tearing me up because while I hate his behavior, I'm feeling heart broken. 

Part of me wants him now and it's awful. It's awful because now I wish he would actually want something with me, something real, instead of regretting me. It's awful because I'm hate him now, for when couldn't keep his hands off of me, when he kissed me and what he said to me. It's so awful I want him because of it. 

I'm sorry to unload on this anonymous site all this emotional garbage. I'm a pretty emotionally reserved person when it comes to things like this, so I haven't been able to bring it up with people in my life. I suppose I'm just looking for some validation, hoping to hear some suggestions to get him out of my head and my emotions. Again, thank you for reading my novel!

Who has been a similar situation as this? How in the hell can I get passed it?

edit: BTW, this is a throwaway. 

**TLDR:** Slept with a straight friend, who has a girl friend, now I feel lost since he's treating me like shit.

edit 2: I wanted to thank everyone for their comments. It feels good to hear truth and response to something painful I've kept private. Honestly, thank you for all your words. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey men, &lt;/p&gt;

So a few months ago I broke up with my first boyfriend, we'd been together for just under two years, but he eventually moved away. We gave the long distance thing a shot but we were just in different places, emotionally and geographically I guess, ha. Towards the end of my relationship I met a guy, let's call him P, who studies the same course as me at University and recognised me from class. From the offset, P was pretty flirtatious, but I was in a committed relationship, distance or not, I don't want to say I friend zoned him, because I hate that term but I definitely kept him at arms length.

A short while after my break up, I bumped into P in a lecture and we got talking, in a completely platonic(now that he was sober, we only ever really saw each other in clubs over the summer prior to classes starting) sense. He asked how me and my boyfriend were doing and I told him about the break up, he suggested that if I wanted to go out with him and some friends some time I was more than welcome, so we exchanged numbers. 

Anyone who's been in a long term relationship knows how much pressure breaking up can put on your mutual friends, and I was the one who did the breaking off, so they tended to side with my ex more than myself, despite the fact he wasn't even living in the country at the time. So I guess going out with P and his friends was kind of a relief where I could just relax, and no one asked me how I was handling the break up, and if we'll get back together when he returns, when was the last time we spoke, etc. He and his friends were kind of a little island oasis where I could just get on with my life.

As time progressed I started to, I guess, develop a liking for P, and one night after the consumption of many drinks, we kissed, and we kissed a few nights after that. He was pretty shy and only came out a few weeks prior to meeting me, so the first few times, I made the first move, and once I made the first move he was more than happy to kiss me back for the rest of the night. I eventually asked him on a date, which he turned me down on, saying it was a bad idea because if things went poorly, we were working on projects together for school and we didn't want to make things awkward and that we should just go on as we currently were. I was fine with this, thought that was a valid excuse, but a part of me kinda though ""hey, maybe he's just not that into you / maybe he's not attracted to you"" which is also entirely plausible. But after a while I guess I got sick of always making the first move, and decided to wait and see if he would. He didn't. Weeks went by, we were going out at least 2/3 nights a week (hey, we're students) together and not once did he try and kiss me first. But that doesn't mean he wasn't flirtatious, he'd always pay me these big compliments, wrap his arms round me from behind and hug me affectionately, try and hold my hand and put my arm around him etc. He would also always insist that I stay in his house after we went out drinking, in his bed, even thought we both live in houses a stones throw away from each other, but nothing remotely sexual would ever happen. There are more examples of flirtatious behaviour but I'm trying to keep this as short as possible.

I was getting increasingly frustrated with the mixed signals. Last week both P and I landed internships at two huge software firms in our city, so naturally we wanted to go out and celebrate. No one seemed particularly keen on going out with us as assignment season was starting, so we went out, just the pair of us, and got absolutely hammered. The night went mostly without incident, he made me promise to go on a trip abroad with him in March for his birthday. We came back to my house after to chill and listen to some music, just like we normally do at his house with his friends after a night on the town, and I went up to use the toilet and when I came down, P was getting his coat on and getting ready to leave. At this point ld assumed he'd be staying in my bed like our usual arrangement, but if he wanted to head home, that was cool by me. So we said our goodbyes and he didn't turn to leave and kept shuffling awkwardly and looking at his feet, like he was trying to say something, and I made some stupid joke about him speeding it up so he could get the fuck out of my house and I could get some sleep, and then he said ""You stress me out."", all serious, I thought this was a joke and threw my arm round him and asked him why I stressed him out.. And I don't know what happened, next thing i knew we were kissing pretty passionately in the middle of my kitchen, and it went on for a while.

After a while we broke it off and we both agreed it was getting late, so I walked him halfway home, and we kissed again and said our goodbyes.

Two days later before a project meeting, we met up and he behaved like it never happened..?

I feel somewhat used I guess, what is strange because we've never did anything beyond kissing.

Which brings me to my question bros, is this guy truly not interested in me romantically, or is he still nervous, having only been out of the closet for a few months? Or perhaps more likely, am I the problem for getting so hung up and overthinking and overanalysing everything and he just wants to be friends? I honestly don't know at this point. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey bros, just wanted to get my feelings out properly as I have no real place to vent about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So a few months ago I broke up with my first boyfriend, we&amp;#39;d been together for just under two years, but he eventually moved away. We gave the long distance thing a shot but we were just in different places, emotionally and geographically I guess, ha. Towards the end of my relationship I met a guy, let&amp;#39;s call him P, who studies the same course as me at University and recognised me from class. From the offset, P was pretty flirtatious, but I was in a committed relationship, distance or not, I don&amp;#39;t want to say I friend zoned him, because I hate that term but I definitely kept him at arms length.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A short while after my break up, I bumped into P in a lecture and we got talking, in a completely platonic(now that he was sober, we only ever really saw each other in clubs over the summer prior to classes starting) sense. He asked how me and my boyfriend were doing and I told him about the break up, he suggested that if I wanted to go out with him and some friends some time I was more than welcome, so we exchanged numbers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone who&amp;#39;s been in a long term relationship knows how much pressure breaking up can put on your mutual friends, and I was the one who did the breaking off, so they tended to side with my ex more than myself, despite the fact he wasn&amp;#39;t even living in the country at the time. So I guess going out with P and his friends was kind of a relief where I could just relax, and no one asked me how I was handling the break up, and if we&amp;#39;ll get back together when he returns, when was the last time we spoke, etc. He and his friends were kind of a little island oasis where I could just get on with my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As time progressed I started to, I guess, develop a liking for P, and one night after the consumption of many drinks, we kissed, and we kissed a few nights after that. He was pretty shy and only came out a few weeks prior to meeting me, so the first few times, I made the first move, and once I made the first move he was more than happy to kiss me back for the rest of the night.

Basically in October I met this guy off of Tinder. He's a professor from Brazil and he came to Toronto to do research at the university here until the end of December. I'm 24 and he's 9 years older than me. We met up many times since October, we didn't have anal sex but we did almost everything else, we texted messaged each other every morning and before we went to bed... good mornings, enjoy your day, good night.. you get the gist of it. Every single time we got together at his place, our encounters were romantic and sensual. We really connected on a deeper human level. I've never connected with anyone else like this before... mind you I am relatively new to exploring my sexuality and meeting guys.

We cuddled as music played... just observing each others faces, holding each other's face and touching each other's face... pecking each other... just taking in every second and every moment... every breath. Anyways I've developed a lot of feelings for him. A fondness for him. He's a very easy going person, very patient with me, never pressured me into doing anything I'm not comfortable doing, obviously intelligent, and academically driven, and incredibly handsome and adorable... with that Brazilian Portuguese accent. 

He said that even though we are not in any formal relationship, that it would hurt him if I were to see anyone else. I told him that as long as I'm seeing him, I won't see anyone else. So midterm week starts 2 weeks ago at my university and I told him as long I am studying and writing them I won't be able to see him. Now it's over and I asked him if he's been seeing anyone else and he said he wouldn't answer me.

I know nothing is formal... but I am upset, mad, and jealous... assuming he has been seeing someone. I feel like deleting him off of FB and not seeing him before he goes back to Brazil. I don't know why I'm so sensitive and emotional. I'm really emo... I've been crying to Schindler's List music as I go to sleep for the past few days. I feel a stinging sensation around my chest. I know this is so immature but I cannot help how I feel. I know I need to chill-out and keep myself preoccupied.

This is my first post here, so bear with me. Here goes, it's quite a long one...

So, I am currently a sophomore at a large public university that is quite liberal and being gay/bi on campus is not really a big deal. This past fall semester, I took a chemistry lab course. In this course, you have lab partners. My parter was cool and nice and all, and we got along well. As the semester progressed, however, I began noticing that he was getting a bit more touchy-feely with me. I didn't really mind, as I thought he was cute and all and brushed it off (mostly) as him simply being playful. He had mentioned he had recently broken up with his girlfriend (he never had sex with her, based on what he has told me), so I assumed him as straight. 

Additionally, as the semester progressed, we began messaging each other over Facebook/texts quite a bit in addition to seeing each other every week in lab, and I started developing feelings for him. We never really met in person outside of lab (besides one time when he asked to get lunch with me in order to study for our lab final), so, again, I really didn't think he felt the same way towards me. I was pretty sure he knew that I was gay, and it seemed to not bother him at all. However, as our messaging progressed, we started discussing more ""sexual"" things; for instance, he would ask me which famous male celebrities' dicks I would like to suck (funny, I know). Also, he mentioned me coming over to his room and sleeping in his bed with him in order to piss off his conservative roommate (again, funny, I know). 

In the past few weeks, he began asking if he would like to hang out with me in my dorm room and drink. I would have loved to, but I always had something going on the nights he asked, so that was unfortunate. When he began asking me this, I had a hunch that perhaps he had feelings for me as well.

Fast forward to a few nights ago. Per usual, he asked me if he wanted to hang out in my dorm room and have some drinks, but I was home that night, so I could not hang out. So, we messaged each other for a while via Facebook, and it got the point that he asked me if I were pining for anyone at the moment. I responded truthfully by saying I had been pining over him. His response was that he had thought so, and admitted that he had had thoughts of us hooking up, and the thought of a guy being interested in him was 'exciting' to him. However, he also said that he doesn't really see himself being in a relationship with a guy, saying that he has conservative parents and such. I responded by saying I would prefer a relationship rather than casual hookups, but wouldn't be entirely opposed to casual hookups, to which he responded ""We shouldn't rush it."" 

We both agreed to meet in person to talk about this situation. So, I guess my question to you, bros, is how do I approach this?

This is my first post here, so bear with me. Here goes, it&amp;#39;s quite a long one...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I am currently a sophomore at a large public university that is quite liberal and being gay/bi on campus is not really a big deal. This past fall semester, I took a chemistry lab course. In this course, you have lab partners. My parter was cool and nice and all, and we got along well. As the semester progressed, however, I began noticing that he was getting a bit more touchy-feely with me. I didn&amp;#39;t really mind, as I thought he was cute and all and brushed it off (mostly) as him simply being playful. He had mentioned he had recently broken up with his girlfriend (he never had sex with her, based on what he has told me), so I assumed him as straight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, as the semester progressed, we began messaging each other over Facebook/texts quite a bit in addition to seeing each other every week in lab, and I started developing feelings for him. We never really met in person outside of lab (besides one time when he asked to get lunch with me in order to study for our lab final), so, again, I really didn&amp;#39;t think he felt the same way towards me. I was pretty sure he knew that I was gay, and it seemed to not bother him at all. However, as our messaging progressed, we started discussing more &amp;quot;sexual&amp;quot; things; for instance, he would ask me which famous male celebrities&amp;#39; dicks I would like to suck (funny, I know). Also, he mentioned me coming over to his room and sleeping in his bed with him in order to piss off his conservative roommate (again, funny, I know). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past few weeks, he began asking if he would like to hang out with me in my dorm room and drink. I would have loved to, but I always had something going on the nights he asked, so that was unfortunate. When he began asking me this, I had a hunch that perhaps he had feelings for me as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to a few nights ago. Per usual, he asked me if he wanted to hang out in my dorm room and have some drinks, but I was home that night, so I could not hang out. So, we messaged each other for a while via Facebook, and it got the point that he asked me if I were pining for anyone at the moment. I responded truthfully by saying I had been pining over him. His response was that he had thought so, and admitted that he had had thoughts of us hooking up, and the thought of a guy being interested in him was &amp;#39;exciting&amp;#39; to him. However, he also said that he doesn&amp;#39;t really see himself being in a relationship with a guy, saying that he has conservative parents and such. I responded by saying I would prefer a relationship rather than casual hookups, but wouldn&amp;#39;t be entirely opposed to casual hookups, to which he responded &amp;quot;We shouldn&amp;#39;t rush it.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

I&amp;#39;m honestly quite confused by the situation, as he has apparently thought of me on sexual terms, indicating that he is possibly bisexual, but seems a bit reluctant to press forward pass a state of friendship.&lt;/p&gt;

It has been moderately successful, but most of them are just arms-lengths friends because I'm not really thoroughly integrated into their previous circle of friends and vice versa.  I'm kind of bad at making friends.

ANYWAYS

I want a relationship so bad. I'm friends with this late-20's/early 30's gay couple who have been together for years and I want what they have more than life itself.  I've done the girlfriend-as-a-beard thing in HS and it was totally unfulfilling because, well, duh, relationships don't work if you can't share a very fundamental part of yourself with your SO. I don't want to feel existentially alone anymore.  I want to do the whole boring Friday night Netflix/pizza/beer college routine. I want to do things with and be challenged by someone else. I want a partner in crime.

I've been working out and eating less to lose weight so that I'll be a more attractive partner.  I wasn't obese by any means, and I've lost ~25 pounds since coming out.  I think I'm looking great (a solid gay 7-7.5), but nothing has changed.  I still can't hold a flame to most of the other gay men in town.  I still can't get a date to save my life. The few coffee dates/meet-ups I have gone to just ended up wanting to be friends.

A big contributing factor to my single-ness is the very small gay population of my town/college.  A vast majority of the gay men in Kansas go to a college 1.5 hours away, making it hard to meet or develop friendships/relationships with them.

Now, I've been told that I should join some things on campus and see if I can meet people with similar interests, which would be great if I had the time.  If I add anything else, I won't have time to spend with said SO.  I've gotten semi-kinda-a-little involved with the campus LGBT alliance, but since it's so late in the semester, they're not really doing much until next semester and even then, it's not the kind of group where I feel very interested in becoming a core, dedicated member.

My therapist said that I shouldn't be in such a hurry.  I just came out, yada yada yada. Give it time, blah blah blah.  Small pool makes finding Mr. Right very unlikely, etc.  But I can't help but think that this is some fundamental failure on my part. Like I'm basically undateable for some reason I can't understand.  I'm usually a very confident person.  I know what I'm doing with my life, I've been told that I'm personable and at least kinda funny (sometimes), work has been going better than ever and I'm a tutor, so I like to think I have interpersonal communication skills.  But here I am, alone, single, laying in bed and staring longingly at a box of Triscuits that I refuse to let myself eat.  What is wrong with me?

We met in HS and came out in college (separate schools).  Hooked up once in college which lead to a bit of drama and separation, but with time got back pretty much to the way things were, or as much as they could be now that we're both grown up and moved out, living close enough to visit each other but not hang out all the time like when we lived in the same town. 

I really do love him, and I think that's OK because he's a great guy and friend and confidant, and he continually (even passively) motivates me as I've maintained a tendency to look up to him over the years. I don't want to stop loving him. 

However on top of that, I think being in love with him is where my struggle comes in. We've both been through a few relationships, some lasting years, and over the course of all of that I haven't been able to truly let go of the bromantic desires I have for this man. 

I'm recently single, and he's in a lengthier relationship (I like the guy he is with, so I can't even complain from that angle) and all I want to do is be happy about that. They're already living together, and I think around that time was when it became apparent exactly how much I am not over him. I want to be the best friend that can go hang out with them (which I do, and is great), but not feel like a lonely miserable shit when I leave. That last part happens almost every time, I leave feeling like the universe has it all wrong sending me home while someone else stays with him. 

So gentlemen, what do I do? I'm not interested or convinced enough that the right road is to hold out for him to realize we are meant to be together and come running to my open loving arms. Though that would be pretty cute. I'd much rather scratch that road off my map, for two reasons. First so I can free myself up to have a healthier (at least from my end) friendship with him. And second so that I can open my heart up in case anyone (else) wants to make their way in there.

I&amp;#39;m not interested or convinced enough that the right road is to hold out for him to realize we are meant to be together and come running to my open loving arms. Though that would be pretty cute. I&amp;#39;d much rather scratch that road off my map, for two reasons. First so I can free myself up to have a healthier (at least from my end) friendship with him. And second so that I can open my heart up in case anyone (else) wants to make their way in there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tl;dr don&amp;#39;t want to let go of someone, but it&amp;#39;s high time to move on. Plz hlp?&lt;/p&gt;
