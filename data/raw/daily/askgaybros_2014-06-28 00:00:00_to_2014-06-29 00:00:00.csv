Turns out he lived thirty minutes away from me. We made plans to meet up two weeks ago and while we didn't do much apart from cuddling and kissing on the first night, we were more intimate the next two times we met up.

I asked if he wanted to hang out with me and my friends at this festival for date three. He said hanging out is fine but he doesn't want to meet my friends until maybe when we know each other better, which is fair enough.

Date four came this past Wednesday. We went to his favourite sushi restaurant and went to a part of town where live music was playing. We walked around for an hour before strolling around a lake. He bought me tea. We didn't have sex.

I'm definitely getting a fifth date - I'll be using his camping gear this long weekend when I go camping... but we haven't talked at all today.

I'd like to think the guy is interested by this point. But... he's a quiet person and I'm not entirely sure what he's thinking; he's still close friends with his ex of three years; I'm also the one to initiate contact mostly; he is thirteen years my senior and he has more dating experience than I have.

I feel my course of action would be to just ask him explicitly, which I may do after I come back from camping this weekend.

25 year old male here, just graduated from grad school. Like a lot of people I have anxiety about getting tested... my situation is weird though, and I guess I'd like some input.

I hooked up with three people my junior year of my undergrad a little over three years ago - just people I had met on A4A - but only had oral sex with them (without a condom), never anything else. They were all clean-cut guys who were very clean and had no visible sores/symptoms of anything, so I just went with it. Nobody swallowed any fluids either so I just kinda put it in the back of my mind.

For one reason or another I never made plans to get tested after those hookups happened. Stupid, I know. I always just said ""well, I'm not showing symptoms, so why bother with having to deal with insurance and whatnot"" (also stupid). 

But now it's been a few years since it's happened, and I haven't had sex since them (no suitable buddies + tons of work in grad school = no time to have sex). I also have never had ANY symptoms of an STD - after reading a bit, it sounds like a lot of diseases can present no symptoms for a good amount of time afterwards, but will eventually start to produce symptoms, and I have never exhibited any. 

Is it probable that, after 3 years, no sex since then, and no symptoms that I could still have an STD (gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, etc) and not know it?

Thanks guys

I will be a junior in college and have recently come to terms with myself and my sexuality as bisexual. I am a member of a rather well-known and well-liked fraternity (lower top tier if we have to label it) at a Big Ten school. I have been one of the more prominent and social members of my fraternity, holding a few Exec. positions and being well-known throughout most of the Greek community. Holding in my sexuality has been really hard for me, and has actually lead to me having serious depression for the past year. Just wondering what advice you have if I choose to publicly come out to my brothers, or if I should at all. Part of me just wants to wait it out and then go off the radar when I graduate to start fresh in a big city and come out then.

My main fears are:

- I will harm the fraternity's reputation. I worry that if word got out then people would start referring to us as a ""gay frat"" which unfortunately would hurt getting good kids for Rush/ good sororities for  mixers. I know its very shallow but also a reality of frat life.

- I will be making my brothers uncomfortable/ I will lose respect from them. I think most of the guys are rather liberal and chill, but homophobic slurs and jokes are thrown around nonstop.

- Girls won't want to hook-up with me anymore. That's what kind of sucks about being bi, is that I still dig chicks too, but not enough to suppress any feelings I have for other guys. But sadly, I know a lot of girls that are completely weirded out by hooking-up with a guy that sleeps with other guys, and it could hurt my chances, especially if I find a girl I really like.

I'm pretty sure he's also gay (but I know you can never be 100% without asking and I'm not ready to be out at work). Most of the time, we have lunch together and when the conversation gets going, it's great and we have some nice banter going. However, since we're both somewhat reserved, quiet people, there are also a lot of awkward silences and I'm doing a lot of the heavy lifting in terms of conversations. Even though he'll invite me to have lunch with him, I'm usually the one asking the questions and telling the stories. It's not like he's giving me one word answers with nothing to go off of - he'll talk at length if prompted but then we'll go back to silence. On my part, the silence comes from running out of stuff to say and being nervous around him, so maybe it's an issue of opening up over time (we've known each other about a month). 

I'm very into him but do these silences mean he's not into me or that there's no mutual spark? He does trust me with somewhat personal information and he told me a few times how glad he is that I'm in that office with him because it's so boring. However, I feel like that means he's just fond of me rather than interested. The big plan was to text him over July 4th weekend asking him out/expressing interest (to save us both the embarrassment in case he's straight/not interested). Now I'm not so sure about doing this because we work next to each other every day and it could be an uncomfortable situation if he's not into me. (He has quite a few gay friends so it wouldn't an intolerance kind of awkward, just a ""ooh, remember the time you rejected me?"" awkward.) 

What do you guys think? I've never asked anyone out before. Also, do you think it's possible for the spark to appear later once he knows I'm interested? Or are our conversations as just friends a pretty good indication of what a date would be like?
