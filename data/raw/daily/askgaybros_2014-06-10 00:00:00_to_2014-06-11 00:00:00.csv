English is not my native language so please don't be a grammar nazi.

To start off, I (20 years old) fell in love with a good friend of mine (18 years old). Lets call him Bill.
Bill is gay himself, but I am unsure about his feelings for me, as he seems to give me contradicting signals. And as we are very close friends, tell each other nearly everything I don't want to risk this friendship.

About two months ago we were partying at a gay party when he started kissing me. We were making out, but didn't get sexual in any way, he stopped that before. We shortly talked after that and he said something like a relationship between us would not work anyway and he does not want to lose me as friend. I can't remembre the correct words, we were both pretty drunk and we went home after that.
And a week later he was making out with an other guy he doesn't have feelings for and who has a crush on him. He has never done anything like that before and it is definitely not normal for him to kiss guys he isnt in a relationship with, he would also never have a one night stand.

last weekend, as we were seeing each other after some time (we live about 120 miles apart), I played a little joke on him. As we were meeting with mutual friends in an other city to stay the weekend there I texted him, I would arrive a day later, no reaction of him.
At the train station the friends picked him up while i was hiding. So he shortly hugged and greeted them and they were walking towards the exit, when I got behind them. After one or two minutes Bill realized i was there. He turned towards me, said something like oh my god your here anyhow, fell into my arm and hugged me like there would be no tomorrow while he was releasing some sort of squeaking. After that he said: Oh, i squeaked like a little girl, I should not do this again!

A few days ago he texted me and said I seem like I would want more than just friendship with him in the past days, so I replied ""Yeah Bill, sort off, but I dont want to risk our friendship etc"".
He replied ""asdf93, I have no feelings for you. Well I have, but not enough for a relationship. I just want to be shure 100% with a person""
In contradiction to that, he said if we would not be so good friends, we would probably be together a few months before.
And when I asked him about us kissing at the party he told me he was drunk and unaware of his actions.

I think since that, our conversations got a bit colder.

Bill is a also a very cuddly guy and we were cuddling a lot. Some mutual friends already assumed we are together but we always say nah were just friends!

As you can see I am pretty confused with this guy, so what do you think? Is there a possibility Bill has the same feelings for me? Or is he really just a friend?
I'll be at work now, so hopefully there is something to read when I return :)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, I really have something to get off my chest an need an advice, hope you bros are okay with that.

After a lot of procrastination, I finally got myself to go and buy some lube (self play only). I'm under 18 so I can't go into a sex shop, and since I'm also underage to drive, I couldn't go anywhere too far.

I decided to finally go and get some, went into a store walking distance from my house, which I specially chose because they have self checkouts, found it too busy and was too scared someone would see me so I left. Came back again a couple days later, same deal. Today I finally decided I would get some, regardless of the circumstances. Luckily it was pretty quiet.

So, I went in. First I got a couple of random cheap stuff to wedge the lube between so that it wouldn't be too noticeable. Then I walked the aisle a couple times and when no one was looking I grabbed it. Hurriedly walked towards the self checkout. Scanned the items and paid.

I was actually feeling pretty happy with myself; I hadn't seen anyone I knew, I had gone relatively quickly etc. I turn around to leave and I see, standing next to me, a teacher from my school. If I had to choose any teacher I didn't want to see, it would be her.
I tried to quickly leave, but before I did, for some reason I said hello to her. I think in that moment I was trying to play it down, so by saying hello to her it wasn't a big deal. She seemed not to recognise me until I said hello, which made me feel even stupider. Now I'm thinking she saw and didn't want to draw attention to it , haha.

While this might be funny in the future, at the moment I'm feeling extremely embarrassed. I'm an exceptionally paranoid person so I'm imagining all types of bad scenarios.

Typing this out, it probably seems like I'm massively overreacting (which I am) but I just thought I would type it out.

Maybe because I am an observant person and notice everybody around me. Maybe because I try so much to be ""somebody else"" sometimes and always feel like an imposter when I do. Maybe it's because I notice that some men just have it so much easier than others.

Whatever it is, I cant help but feel that sometimes, some men are just born luckier, better, more likable, more able to get a good job, a boyfriend, make friends easily. It could be upbringing or it could just be the law of nature (alpha male symptoms).

 I like to observe the hierarchies when I'm at the gym. I have decided who is on top (usually the taller guys with short haircuts, cut, muscular bodies, perfect teeth and smiles, mid 20s to 30s). Then there are the ""opening acts."" The guys who are not so naturally dominant or popular, have to work pretty hard to get what they want, but are still looked up to, are attractive (on a scale of 1-10, these are 8-9s), but are not the highest pecking order.

This goes on all the way down to the guys who are blatantly insecure, don't like to get naked in the locker room because they're embarassed  can't hold a conversation, always look nervous, walk around looking at their feet, not very athletic or built, but try really hard.

Do you really think that men can transform themselves from one end of the caste system to the other? The older I get, the less I believe this to be the case. Maybe it's my cynicism, and maybe it's my real life experience with trying to be the top dog, only to realize, they want nothing to do with me, and I don't feel natural being a part of their group anyway.
