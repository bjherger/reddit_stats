Hey all, so I made a bad decision this weekend that has been stressing me out a lot ever since. 

I was curious about blowing a guy, but haven't really done much like this before (only once before with a drunk friend, for like a minute or two). I had been browsing Craigslist and eventually found someone, went to their house and did stuff. 

Turns out, I'm super not into that, as I was terrified the entire time I was there, and I think he could tell so our contact was very limited. I blew him for about 5 minutes without a condom, he rubbed himself against my ass briefly (no insertion) and finished on me. He was very adamant that he was clean of any diseases, even offering to show me a doctor's record, but I'm still worried. 

After the first few days I've managed to contain my panic about most diseases, just due to low probability of transmission, but 2 days after the encounter my throat got sore and has been for the past 4 days. My one tonsil is a bit swollen, the other not so much, and the back of my throat is a bit red, but doesn't seem terribly bad. I'm planning on getting tested for std's in a week since the tests aren't effective until then, but I'm trying to at least figure out what this is first. 

I'm figuring it's either a bacterial reaction from him not cleaning properly, strep from him not cleaning properly, or oral ghonnerea. I had a bit of a sore throat after the encounter with my friend a while ago, but my throat wasn't sore for as long (I didn't really look at the time though since I just assumed it was bruising). 

So yeah I know it was stupid to not be using a condom, and I'm definitely done with Craigslist encounters, but if anyone can give me advice I'd appreciate it. If my throat gets worse I'll be going to my doctors early, but I probably won't be able to do that for a few days, and would rather not be stressing thus whole time.

He was in his early twenties, we knew each other through work connections and stuff.  Great guy I looked up to.  We hung out from time to time, talked on nearly a daily basis, helped each other out, etc. When I was approaching 18, he started to get a little weird and a little more hostile about not having the friendship we used to have.  Given the age gap and everything, I tried to let him down easy about it.  I then figured out he had a crush on me.  From time to time I would be forgiving, but he would keep insisting that there's something more between us.  He never tried to get physical nor was he graphic, but it got to the point where I could not deal with it anymore.  He kept getting upset when he was around me at work (a seasonal job).  Despite apologizing, I had to cut him off.  

He was still trying to contact me and admitted everything he did was wrong.  He also said we should at least be civil and learn to co exist especially if we will work together seasonally and may end up running into each other since we live in the same town.

We kissed every time we said hello and goodbye, held hands, all that shit.  It was great.  Until it ended last week.  He told me that he was no longer attracted to me, like a switch had been turned off.  I was obviously crushed, but accepted it.  Now I’m just not sure what to do.  I want to be his friend for life, but its tough when I still have romantic feelings and he’s been my rock for so long.  I don't have many friends, but the ones I do have offered superficial advice.

I gave this guy multiple chances to get to know me. We hung out a few time but as well he stood me up 2x in less than 24 hrs.

Today I finally got fed up with him. Stating I always initiate to hangout with you but you seem to always blow me off.  I told him that im losing interest waiting for something that most likely will never come by. I said I would be lying if I said I didnt like you and find you attractive. 

His response to that is that he is busy and my work schedule is hard to work around (I work 7pm-4am... I have all day to hang out and free weds and Thursdays.  He just works at a 24 hr gym) anyways he said maybe nect week weds or Thursday we can hang but again he doesn't really set up a specific day and time so like not much. Honestly I have been losing interest and patients. 

Here is where it gets good.  Im a cop, I gave him one of those cards to save him from getting tickets. Tonight while out I get a unknown call. They asked if I know blank. I said yes. They basically told me he was drinking and driving and found a roach that they were smoking in the car. I apologize for him and said I will talk to him....

Basically I got him out of an arrest. That made me realize he is immature and that im a dumb ass for giving him that card.

Anyways like 30 mins later he texts me like nothing happened and I went straight to the point saying what happened exactly.  He apologized and said it was his friends and he wasn't drinking and didnt know about the drugs in the car and that's he's sorry.  Now he wants to take me out for lunch and saying how I've been so nice and helpful and how he never gave us a chance but now wants to see where things will go....

He would post song lyrics on my wall of songs that we often listened to while smoking and playing xbox. Some of them could be seen as having romantic undertones?

However, Mike had some personal issues to work out and ended up moving back to his home town. After that I kinda shut down and ended up moving back to my home town myself seven months later. I can't even say I realized any feelings until he left. It sucked a lot.
I know that I could definitely just be an idiot but I cannot shake this feeling. We have kind of lost touch with each other and whenever I think about all of it I feel it in the pit of my stomach. I miss him every god damn day. And he's fuckin' straight.

I have noticed a trend over the years of finding interest only in guys that I know are unobtainable and it is driving me insane. I feel like it is really immature to want what you can't have, but one of you bros has got to have some advice for me.

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR gaybro gets straightbro best friend and may or may not have significant romantic feelings for straightbro. Halp.&lt;/p&gt;

As long as I can remember I was never satisfied with my body but I think bodybuilding even made it worse..I'm always comparing myself to somebody else in the room and if they're bigger then me or more shredded it makes me want to do whatever it takes to be better then them Anything.Once it got so bad when I was cutting to get more shredded I binged and ate a whole pizza..i vomited it up or else I knew I would make myself feel like a failure for the rest of the week.The funny thing is that I'm just getting in shape to look good (I'm not even competing in bodybuilding right now).

So I met this guy about a month ago, in a mutual-friends, definitely-not-looking-for-a-hookup sort of place. We started talking/hanging out, in a relatively platonic way because he made it known fairly early on that he has a boyfriend (and they are exclusive, at least nominally. More on that later). We went and watched a movie last night, went for beers afterward, one thing led to another, and we started making out.

The subject of pressing things further than making out came up, and after describing himself as a slut, he reminded me of the boyfriend. I told him that I wasn't willing to run around behind someone's back, so it never got to anything more substantial than making out (well, maybe a little groping ;)).

Now, I'm starting to second-guess myself. Part of me thinks that this is the ol' savior complex acting up again, that I shouldn't concern myself with policing other people's relationships, and that I'm not really damaging anything anyway because the boyfriend has already been cheated on. Another part of me thinks that that's just a rationalization, that I can't sleep with him while he's attached no matter how much we both want to, and that I should actually have a lower opinion of him because I'm clearly doing a better job of respecting his relationship than he is.

See I am very physics skeptical, like I really must be sexually attracted to a person looks, like the body must be athletic like mine, and I have seen guys like these.

So listen; I have had the chance to spot gay guys who are ""attracted"" to me, like let's say in a party you spot a guy who continuously sees you and his behavior gives signs that he is gay (not a diva, but a normal guy that happens to be gay), recently I have started to continuously follow the looks we both make, like if he sees me I see him like sending signals, but for some reason the other dude will look to somewhere else and pretend nothing happened.

I am in the closet as well, and I am sure the other guy(s) are too so it's really hard to even get to talk to him.

This post will look pointless to some people but i have no one to talk to about these things and i just want to let things out and see opinions!
So im a 17 year old gay muslim arab living in Jordan!
I dont even consider my self a muslim anymore because being gay is really hated in islam and i was born gay and
Nothing changed my sexuality , i had a great childhood ,lived like any normal child so ,nothing changed my sexuality so why would allah
Make me this way if he doesnt want people to do it!
So i live a normal teenager life , i have lots of friends and some close friends and i go out with them alot and have fun and none of them even thinks im gay it really doesnt show
But lately ive been really sad and cry myself to sleep every night and i dont have anyone to talk to , and i know if i tell any one of my close friends about my issue they will tell the others and they wont be the same with me and my parents would never talk to me again basically this country has so many gays but most of them are in the closet because its really hated to be gay here and i dont know what the hell will i do if i stay here cause i probably am!! Im in senior year right now and im sure my parents cant afford sending me to study abroad were not poor but were not rich and im sure i cant get a scholarship anywhere with our local education system that im taking (tawjihi)
And i dont know what to do when i stay here in jordan i really love my friends so much and i have fun with them but coming out to them will
Make me lose them, not because theyre its because theyre brainwashed to hate homosexual i dont even know how , they start making sick faces if they see a gay guy on tv on something which disgusts me 
I just want to have a normal fucking life like them get a boyfriend , and have fun!
And in 5 years my parents will probably want me to get married and i dont know what will i do 
Being gay and stuck here is the worst situation you could ever be in
I read some arabic jordanian guys story who went to a shrink here 
But he ended up giving him pills to
Make him forget about his gay thoughts? And he said it didnt work and he ended up getting married to a girl and he kept wishing he would get attracted to her but he couldnt and ended up just getting used to her being there and started loving her
I dont know if thats real but it gave me a small hope that i can get married have kids and be attracted to my wife 
That would be a dream
But then i check gaybros reddit and see the couples and their happy life thats what i want not the other life
I dont know why im writing all of this bullshit but writing it just made me feel better
Oh and i recently lost a girl bestfriend due to her liking me i even thought of coming out to her just to make things unawkard but i just couldnt and it made me more depressed Im sorry for my bad english its not my first language and im still learning it

But lately ive been really sad and cry myself to sleep every night and i dont have anyone to talk to , and i know if i tell any one of my close friends about my issue they will tell the others and they wont be the same with me and my parents would never talk to me again basically this country has so many gays but most of them are in the closet because its really hated to be gay here and i dont know what the hell will i do if i stay here cause i probably am!! Im in senior year right now and im sure my parents cant afford sending me to study abroad were not poor but were not rich and im sure i cant get a scholarship anywhere with our local education system that im taking (tawjihi)
And i dont know what to do when i stay here in jordan i really love my friends so much and i have fun with them but coming out to them will
Make me lose them, not because theyre its because theyre brainwashed to hate homosexual i dont even know how , they start making sick faces if they see a gay guy on tv on something which disgusts me 
I just want to have a normal fucking life like them get a boyfriend , and have fun!
And in 5 years my parents will probably want me to get married and i dont know what will i do 
Being gay and stuck here is the worst situation you could ever be in
I read some arabic jordanian guys story who went to a shrink here 
But he ended up giving him pills to
Make him forget about his gay thoughts? And he said it didnt work and he ended up getting married to a girl and he kept wishing he would get attracted to her but he couldnt and ended up just getting used to her being there and started loving her
I dont know if thats real but it gave me a small hope that i can get married have kids and be attracted to my wife 
That would be a dream
But then i check gaybros reddit and see the couples and their happy life thats what i want not the other life
I dont know why im writing all of this bullshit but writing it just made me feel better
Oh and i recently lost a girl bestfriend due to her liking me i even thought of coming out to her just to make things unawkard but i just couldnt and it made me more depressed Im sorry for my bad english its not my first language and im still learning it
I just want you guys to tell me what can i do in this situation&lt;/p&gt;

I want to start off by saying that I think being prejudiced based on ""cut"" or ""uncut"" is WRONG. It's almost never the choice of the guy to be cut or uncut; and both have their pros and cons. 

Nevertheless, the anti-cut movement on this sub seems really disconnected with reality in my experience. I suppose that in North America, as most men are cut, there's a kind of ""fetish"" for the slightly more rare uncut. I get that. But I live in a country where the majority is uncut (rates somewhere between the US and the UK), and this is never an issue for the vast majority of people. However, of the people (men and women) I know who do have a preference, all except 3 prefer cut. Even my uncut friends prefer cut. Because I have family, friends, and obligations in many diverse countries, I travel and talk to a lot of people. It seems to be the same almost everywhere - either no preference, preference for cut, or slight preference for uncut. Usually, it's linked to cultural or religious practice.

The hate going around here is quite bizarre. Personally, I belong to an ethnic and religious group that does, and forever will, circumcise (you can probably guess that I'm either Muslim or Jewish). I'm cut, with a nice, big, thick dick (;-)), and love every tiny bit of it. I don't suffer from the shit that people here love to bang on about, like ""hard disgusting skin"", ""no sensitivity"", ""ugly scarring"" bla bla bla. And nobody I've ever been with suffers from such things either. It's basically complete bullshit to say that all cut men suffer from this. 

I don't get offended or upset in the slightest reading the anti-cut hate on here. *Not at allllllllllll*. Every single time I have removed my pants, I have never received any reaction other than joy/happiness/excitement/screams of ""fuck me!"". I love my cut dick, and personally I prefer cut too. Most guys I have been with do, too. However, I don't demonise uncut, talk about how gross it is, or any of that shit. I wouldn't discriminate against someone based on their foreskin status either. It's quite pathetic.

I want to again reiterate (because I know some people didn't read the first part) that I think being prejudiced when people don't have a choice is totally wrong. I just want some of you to wake up and stop hating on cut guys.

Thanks so much guys, it has been a long rollercoaster ride between me and the feelings I have for him and he's staying over tonight, but I'm not sure I should post what happens in the bed 😜, hopefully something steamy Thanks again guys for making me have the balls to do it thanks

I have some back story here as well as a tl;dr at the end.

Anyways: I'm in a year-long relationship with a wonderful man (let's call him José), in his late thirties. We live together and he has been in this country (USA) for ~~fifteen~~ twenty-five years. [edit: I need to improve my math] He was brought into this country as a young teenager (about 12) by his mother and they lived his half-brothers (neither father was or is in the picture). His mother was extremely abusive, verbally and physically. One day, when he was 15, the abuse was enough for my boy and he stood up to his mother and didn't back down. To his mother's surprise, rather than come to her defense applauded José. Seeing the writing on the wall, she left and returned to Mexico. His half-brothers, in no position nor mental capacity to raise a high school student, and with mixed feelings about him as a half-brother too, pulled José from school and had him work as a day laborer to pay for rent.

However, José was extremely smart and intelligent and was able to build a life for himself her in the US, with the help a strong network of friends he was able to build. He's not in contact with a large chunk of his family anymore due to the fall-out of his coming out (in addition to the abuse straining family bonds).

I've only been out for about a year and a half, and José is my first serious relationship. We met my parents together a few months ago, and since we mentioned that he has family from Mexico, they asked if he was a citizen. I could tell that he was a little uncomfortable so I said ""He's a resident."" (I know, shouldn't have deliberately misled them, but José was truthful about his status from day 1.) But now, with immigration back on the headlines, my mom revisited the subject (to which I held to the original line him as ""a resident."") José was understandably upset when I told him about this, understood my parents' position and curiosity about the man in their son's life but still felt judged. This has been an issue in all of his previous relationships (almost all Southern men, so his accent is a sexy blend of Hispanic and deep South), so he has to deal with his status and be reminded and almost daily. He almost pulled out of Thanksgiving until I reassured him that anyone that asks questions would have to come through me first. Most of my family is liberal, on both same-sex marriage and immigration. If it comes up again, should we tell the whole truth?

Also about the headlines, we're debating whether to follow the headlines and have him try and fall under one of the expanded [DACA](http://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/consideration-deferred-action-childhood-arrivals-daca) (deferred action for childhood arrivals, see link). Even though he is a childhood arrival, he is over 30 and never had the opportunity to get his GED (due to his demanding career). Like most undocumented people, he pays his taxes (with an unused social security number), pays his bills and credit card on time, and has never been arrested. Would you have your boy request deferred action, even if that had him possibly exposed to future policy or presidential changes?

We're very serious, and expect to get married (it's legal now!). Before Obama's announcement, we were going use that to help legalize him. I know that for his status, a quick registration at the clerk's office would be best, but we talked and agreed that we would want a medium-sized beach wedding with friends and family and are trying to save for it. (He is older than me and make more than me at the moment.) I expect to be married well before Obama leaves office. My family has been completely supportive, but worry at little that we are going too fast. To respect that, I haven't told them that we are all but engaged. What would you bros do? I don't know if there are any immigration lawyers here, but maybe how would you guys hand this.

**tl;dr**: I'm in a very serious relationship with an undocumented man, successfully professionally but without a GED. I've known since day 1, but kept my family in the dark about his status. With Thanksgiving coming up and the expansion of deferred action by Obama, would you tell your family? Would you have your boyfriend request deferred action or just sort it out two years after you are married?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone, a throwaway here because a few people know what my real username is.

My family has been completely supportive, but worry at little that we are going too fast. To respect that, I haven&amp;#39;t told them that we are all but engaged. What would you bros do? I don&amp;#39;t know if there are any immigration lawyers here, but maybe how would you guys hand this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt;: I&amp;#39;m in a very serious relationship with an undocumented man, successfully professionally but without a GED. I&amp;#39;ve known since day 1, but kept my family in the dark about his status. With Thanksgiving coming up and the expansion of deferred action by Obama, would you tell your family? Would you have your boyfriend request deferred action or just sort it out two years after you are married?&lt;/p&gt;

Admittedly, I don't have the best of gaydars and I'd like some help sorting out some mixed signals I've been getting from a guy. I'll preface this by saying I live in a socially conservative midwestern city and while I'm out, a lot of guys here aren't. I'm 22 and the guy in question is 20. I think he's attractive but, I tend fear accidentally hitting on straight guys.

I was hired a little over a month ago as a temporary IT contractor for a large firm who needs assistance with a large project. I meet everybody on the team and everybody seems cool. The guy in question on the team is named Austin (well, not really but play along). He's pretty much your stereotypical cocky ""I really hate people; let me lock myself in a dark room and code"" type of programmer. I also happen to be taking a few classes with him. This work environment has a mixture of single and double person cubes. For the first few days, I spent most of my time alone in one of these double cubes.

After these first few days, Austin starts sitting with me and we start talking. Started off with talking about our IT interests and pursuits. This quickly evolved into him giving me a ton of crap (in a friendly way) for some of our differences in opinions. Gradually evolved from there into talking about more personal stuff. Learned that he is the youngest in a large Catholic family.

Now, onward to the things I've noticed
- He constantly is talking to me. Total chatterbox, which was a complete 180 from what I experienced when I initially met him. I'd say 30% of that is work related and the other 70% is outside of work related subjects.

- When we're talking, he always turns facing me and gives me 100% of his attention. Also, the eyebrows. He was always so stern and mean lookin' at first but now he's all grins and smiles.

- He goes way out of his way to help me with things. Rest of the team has an attitude of ""if you need help, you have to ask for it."" He doesn't really go out of his way to help other team members. He has the attitude of ""he/she can do that themselves, I have enough to do.""

- Initially, communications via Lync (corporate IM) were very formal but then he soon started using a considerable amount of emoticons

- About 2 weeks in, he provides his cell phone number and friends me on Facebook. Next day he talks in great detail about all kinds of stuff on my Facebook profile.

- He has gradually escalated the amount of ""personal space invasion"" and nudging, touching

- He has mentioned having a girlfriend on several occasions but his attitude regarding her has been either neutral or negative. I know they've been together since high school. I don't know much else about her and I've never met her personally.

- I've noticed that he's been doing an excessive amount of stretching and subsequent flexing, letting his shirt ride up in front of me while we're talking. At least 4-5 times within a 10 minute period.

- Last week he took me out to his car to show me some damage caused by somebody backing into him. My car was literally just a row down but he apologized and insisted he drop me off. Again, back to going out of his way for me...","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throwaway account for privacy concerns...

I started a relationship with a guy in June. We met on Grindr. On the third date, we said we'd be exclusive, and shortly after, declared each other our boyfriends.

It was very casual and felt natural. He has off in the summers and we went on lots of adventures together. About a month into it, my friend texted me that he saw him on Grindr. When I asked him about it, he said he'd delete it, and he did for a little while. 

One night when he was sleeping over, I got nervous, did a shitty thing, and looked through his phone. He had Grindr on it and was messaging people left and right. ""Wanna hook up?"" ""Fuck me!"" Dozens and dozens of messages a night, really desperate sounding. There was one message, too, which indicated he had sex with someone he met on there. There were also texts with a friend of ours saying ""Can't wait to feel your cock in me."" I woke him up and was furious. He denied the Grindr hookup, though later admitted to it after I asked him about it a thousand times.

He said he dated someone for four years who forced an open relationship on him and basically cheated the entire time, causing him to have serious trust and abandonment issues. My therapist suggested he went out to hurt me before I could hurt him in kind.

He also explained that after his father unexpectedly passed recently, he's been a wreck. He is addicted to Grindr, he said, and uses it to get off. I've ascertained that he has very little self-esteem and uses flirting from Grindr as a false sense of excitement or self-esteem boost. I get it, because I've been there. I have cheated on a past partner for basically the same reasons.

One day, while I was on a week-long vacation, he said he got a letter with family drama stating his deceased father's crazy ex-wife is forbidding him to see his little half-sister through a restraining order. He felt so scared and rejected, he said, that he called that mutual friend for sympathy, and they ended up having sex. 

We broke up because I can't trust him and he doesn't trust himself to not cheat. Of course, love is tricky and I found myself talking to him again. He has apologized for everything, seems to really regret what he did, and had me put a child block on his iPhone so he can't download Grindr again. He also started seeing a therapist, at my strong suggestion. Half the time I believe that he wants to change, and the other half of the time my nervous brain says, ""What are you thinking? He cheated and he's probably doing it again.""

He doesn't seem fully ready to talk about his emotions or to tell me the full truth. He insists that the ""truth"" is pretty much what I found out about plus that mutual friend he admitted to. It could be, but I have no proof either way. I can tell that he is very into me and doesn't want to lose me. He's done a lot of work planning sweet surprises and did so even before he cheated. In other words, I know he cares about me quite a bit, though he seems to have some powerful inner demons. 

It's shocking because he comes across as a fun, self-assured and sweet person. He has a million friends. We had a lot of fun together, he showed me lots of new things, and everyone who met him liked him a lot. He has a lot of qualities that I really admire. It was weird because it was super fun and casual before being intense. I also moved to a new place and don't know a lot of people, so I tend to get lonely in my apartment. I have great friends who have been super supportive, though they live rather far away and I can't afford to see them all the time. 

I'm seeing a therapist to deal with this shock and the other crap in my life. And yes, I got a full STD spectrum test, and so did he: all negative. I know that it's probably best for me and him to be apart, though I don't know how to manage this transition. 90% of you are going to say ""GTFO"" and I will, though I'd like to find some way to minimize the pain and get closure.


So gaybros, I came to you because I think only a gay guy can really get what I'm talking about. I have some specific questions, not just ""should I be with him"":
**Have any of you been through something similar? How'd you work with the cheating partner to  find closure and feel ""at peace"" with being cheated on? How were you successful minimizing the pain?**","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi gaybros,&lt;/p&gt;

I came out to most of my friends and my twin sister about a year ago. (about 1 month after I finally admited it to myself). My coming out to my friends was entirely positive, everybody was very supportive. There has been the occasional ""oh my god we have to go shopping"" from some female friends, but that's okay, even though I'm not flamboyant, I DO love to go shopping.

I came out to my mother last summer, which was alright, I always knew she was okay with it, but I couldn't tell her out of fear that she would think she'd have to tell my dad. She didn't because she thought he might not take it well. 

The thing is, my dad is relatively conservative and basically unpredictable when it comes to homosexuality. On the one hand, my mom told me, he did speak out for homosexuals when there was some problem at his christian conservative society, on the other hand, listening to him and my even more conservative older brother (who I'm not out to because he would probably tell my dad, other than that I can't wait seeing his reaction, if it's positive, good, if not, he can basically go to hell). rant about Conchita Wurst winning the ESC (note that I'm from Austria, the land she's from) was one of my worst times in my life. 

My mother, sister and I already tried asking him question to declare his stance, but the answers were alwas mixed, and you know, you can only do so much asking until it gets suspicious.

So my mum had the idea to sort of ""ease him into the topic"" by showing him positive/neutral depictions of gay men of some sort, which is also problematic because even though we do watch sitcoms etc. in english it is really hard to get him to watch with us because he is usually to tired after work (so movies would be better)

**So I guess my question is:** what movies/tv-shows (/other media?) are suitable for slowly engaging my dad with the idea that homosexuality is not that bad without it getting suspicious? (Or even better that a homosexual son is not bad)
Also, any other ideas of subtly giving attention to the topic are highly appreciated.

I did already think about The New Normal, but that wouldn't be anything my mom would watch and it would be very ominous.
Also Happy Endings would work, but I kind of think that my Dad would hate Max because he is not a fan of sloppiness, although the show often plays with gay stereotypes and debunks or ridicules them, which is good i think.

PS: I really want to tell him, because even though we have a really good relationship, it does feel fake because i have the fear that the relationship would not be as good if he knew that I am gay.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am 20 years old,  I&amp;#39;m going to University about 2 hrs from my hometown and I am still financially reliant on my parents.

I have been with a few guys previous to this, but nothing more. Fast forward to the past couple months.

So I met a guy off grindr(I know, bad idea). He is in a similar situation to me, only dated girls, except he is only out to one person. We talked and agreed to meet up for some beers and dinner..we live a bit over an hour away from each other so we met halfway..dinner went great, immediately hit it off, had a great time, finished by kissing outside for a bit. Over the next 1.5 months, we've made time to see each other 2-4 times a week, both going to each other's houses, going out having dinner, seeing movies, etc..I introduced him to a couple of my friends, he did the same(although to most of them as just a friend).

We have both discussed how much we like each other, but that it was extremely new territory. Like I said, I've never felt any connection before to a guy, but with him it's different and I've fallen pretty hard for him. Over the past week or so, I've noticed him getting a bit distant. I brought it up to him and he noted he tends to get distant when getting comfortable. I also mentioned taking the next step and seeing what dating would be like, but he said he wasn't sure he could make the commitment yet because it's still very different to what he's used to. He ensured me we can still keep seeing each other and that he still likes me. Of note, he still on grindr.

I guess I'm just ranting, but does anybody have any input into this situation? Should I hold out hope and really trust that he wants to date, just isn't ready yet? Or is it hopeless cause of how much hes still in the closet? I'd be lying if I said I'm not extremely upset, I kinda feel like I just got dumped by a high school date.

Over the past week or so, I&amp;#39;ve noticed him getting a bit distant. I brought it up to him and he noted he tends to get distant when getting comfortable. I also mentioned taking the next step and seeing what dating would be like, but he said he wasn&amp;#39;t sure he could make the commitment yet because it&amp;#39;s still very different to what he&amp;#39;s used to. He ensured me we can still keep seeing each other and that he still likes me. Of note, he still on grindr.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess I&amp;#39;m just ranting, but does anybody have any input into this situation? Should I hold out hope and really trust that he wants to date, just isn&amp;#39;t ready yet? Or is it hopeless cause of how much hes still in the closet? I&amp;#39;d be lying if I said I&amp;#39;m not extremely upset, I kinda feel like I just got dumped by a high school date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typed this on my phone, sorry for bad editing!&lt;/p&gt;
