I make a ton more money than him so I am constantly buying things for our apartment or for him. Sometimes he repays me by going out to bars by himself (I cant go because i work in the mornings) and then he comes out violent and out of control and proceeds to make messes in the apartment. Now, this doesnt happen ALL the time, but it happens enough to where it has scarred me. I HATE even having a beer with him because it terrifies me where that one beer would lead. I usually just drink alone and when I drink I become friendly and talkative. Another thing is that I work out, a lot. Not to honk my own horn, but I think I look pretty good and people tell me that. He has been on a junk food diet and does nothing but watch TV when he comes home from work or wherever. Needless to say hes gained a ton of weight. This has nothing to do with how I feel about him.

I have this friend that I met before my partner. He had a crush on me and really liked me but we didnt do anything other than hugging. He moved away to LA and has recently come back. He knows what I go through with my partner and he says it tears him apart seeing me suffer. So we hang out A LOT since he came back and have become better friends.

I just laugh it off and take it as a compliment. But recently i have found myself being attracted to him. I am not like most gay guys. I cannot have casual sex or want you just because of your looks. I MUST get to know you and like who you are. 

Anyways, last night me and him were drinking and smoking pot together and playing video games. I shared all these funny stories i had and he just sat there and listened. When it came time for him to go it was awkward. He stood at my door and was just like ""well...until next time..."" and just looked at me. I was tempted to make a move. Not like a move to entice sex but I really really wanted to grab him and kiss him. BUT I just could not. I had to respect my partner even though he was out getting drunk and would be home shortly to fuck shit up.

I'm gay although not obviously so. I never considered myself a closet case per se but I'm of the opinion that it isn't anyone's business who I am attracted too.

My old neighbor bumped into me making out with a guy kind of outside a bar, that neighbor is a good friend of my dads and a drinking buddy and told him. My dad was pissed - understandably so- it is a hard pill to swallow and not something he expected. All people have certain internal hopes for their kids (get married to a nice Irish catholic girl and have nice irish catholic babies) and after my brother turned out (perennially incarcerated crack addict who lives in Florida) I guess the hopes were higher. He has been quiet afterwards so I assumed he had calmed down and I was planning on just continuing on a DADT kind of basis (as in, I really have no need to speak with him about it so let's just let it not be spoken about).

I don't know if any of yous are  familiar with Boston. I live in Southie which up until maybe 2009 what was what can best be described as the last true bastion of Caucasian urban poverty, a ""white ghetto"" if you will (complete with 100% irish housing projects that I spent the first 10 years of my life in). But in the last few years it's gotten very yuppie like especially close to the train and it has really kicked into overdrive in the last year and a half. Our lease ends on April 1st and the increase in rent is too much, I guess the landlord is trying to get us white trash out and bring some college educated Midwesterners in..

My dad told me that he is giving up the apartment and moving with his bleach blonde over tattooed girlfriend to a city on the other side of the state where rent is cheaper. He doesn't work because of an injury and gets disability payments. He told me ""I still love you but I really don't feel comfortable living with someone who is into that and if you're grown up enough to go out on a Saturday night and find men to sleep with, you're grown up enough to find you're own place to live"". Which is totally fair and I respect and understand his opinion..it just puts me in a predicament.

Boston is crazy expensive, maybe only Manhattan or San Francisco is more for rent. I work part time as a cashier and after tax bring home like $160 per week or $650ish per month. I am looking for a second job forever but no luck :(. I'm waiting to get a call from the union because I got accepted into a carpenter apprenticeship which is steady work with great benefits, it's not if they're gonna call me but when because there is a waitlist and I won't start work until there is enough openings that I'm at the top...until then I'm screwed. I don't have enough to rent a room (probably minimum $700 and that's before a train pass, food, utilities etc.) and I don't have any friends or family to stay with. If this was last year I could've stayed with my mom in the projects in East Cambridge, but she is in prison now for 4-10 years. 

I don't know what to do. I am a scrawny red headed white boy, I will get killed sleeping on the street if I don't freeze to death. I am trying to see if I can get into the projects or something, especially since I lived there before or at least get help from the city. I don't know what to do. Anyone been in this situation and want to give me some advice? Anything? But please do me a favor and **dont say anything bad about my dad. He is right in the essence that I am a grown man going out and doing grown man things and I respect his feelings. I love him very much and it will just make me feel worse. I am not going to stay mad at him because he is the only non-incarcerated, non-drug addicted (beer is his thing) non-dead family member I have. I want to prove to him that I can be independent and stuff and that he did not screw up raising me.**

talking and I'm sometimes dragged along.

I keep my distance.I can't afford another repeat of my previous

In a couple of weeks, they will both be available. I like both but can't have both. Very complicated situation. IDK what to do

**Background**

Before all this happened, I had been on dates with girls, but never had sex (but wanted to to try). With guys, I had sex, but had never dated (but wanted to try). I'm a 22 year old college student. I've been very confused about my sexuality, figuring I'm somewhere around bisexual or bi-favoring-men. I'm still closeted, but now that I am starting to feel comfortable with myself I would like to experiment.

**The Girl**

This girl is amazing, I haven't crushed this hard for a female (or anyone) in a few years. She's insanely attractive, funny, nerdy, and we share many interests. The problem is, she goes to school in a different state, so she's only back home during breaks.

The last time she was home was for winter break. Well, she's an english major and heard I was writing a book, so she came over and we started talking. I invited her to a party at my fraternity, and later that night we were making out. We talked about going on a date, but sadly, I left for Christmas, and she was back at her school by the time I was back on campus.

**The Guy**

So a while back I tried out Grindr because I was curious in meeting guys. I normally just cruise for sex, but I started talking to this one guy just normal conversation. It was fun, and he gave me his number. About a week later, I delete grindr because there were no hot guys who were looking for no strings attached in my area. I took a chance and texted him after I deleted, saying I'd like to take him out for dinner that weekend.

It was my first date with a guy, and it was awesome. He's cute, funny, educated, and confident in himself. He's 27, so he has a bit more life experience than me, which is cool. He knows I'm not out, and understands I'm working through it. We went to dinner and talked for hours. When saying goodbye, I planted my first in-public gay kiss, and there were fireworks. We texted cute things during the week, and had a second date the following weekend. 

The second date was also fun, but I was nervous because it was my first-ever second date (guy or girl). This time, we left the restaurant, went back to his apartment, smoked some weed, and had an awesome 3-hour naked cuddling/make out/oral session. 

**The Problem**

The second date was 10 days ago, and since then talking with the guy has taken a downward turn. He is very busy with two jobs, and really only has free time on the weekend (which is when I typically work). He is often not home until after 11PM each night, and can't text while he's at work. I understand that he is busy... but I am trying to gage whether he is interested in going on a third date or not.  I don't want to pester him, but if he has time to accept my challenges in games on facebook, why can't he text me back? (even if it is hours after I texted him)

He has said work will be slower during spring break, and I will be more available then too. Problem is, the girl is coming back in town for her spring break the same week and wants to hang. Since I am closeted, it would be much more ""convenient"" for me to try dating her. I would be able to bring her home and to fraternity events without having to come out. I'm scared/excited though because I've never been intimate with a girl beyond kissing since I usually end up friend-zoned. I think this is my first real opportunity at something more.

Now, I'm at the point in my life where things are starting to change. I can see a bright future ahead, and am becoming more comfortable with myself. I feel like if I could just date the guy a little longer... I would finally be sure enough to come out. I feel happy around him, and that realization is definitely a driving factor towards me leaving the closet. But at the same time, I've never felt so strongly about a girl before, and don't want to lose that opportunity. I mean, she's literally amazing, and if I wait some other guy may come along. The guy has expressed he doesn't date often (and he just moved here a few months ago) so I'm not as worried about him finding someone else...

**Conclusion**

WOW. Thank you for your patience reading through all that... But anyway, I could really use some input from you guys. Looking for advice that could help me decide how to proceed with this.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#39;m crushing hard after two people, and neither are available (time or location) to date right now. In a couple of weeks, they will both be available. I like both but can&amp;#39;t have both. Very complicated situation. IDK what to do&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before all this happened, I had been on dates with girls, but never had sex (but wanted to to try). With guys, I had sex, but had never dated (but wanted to try). I&amp;#39;m a 22 year old college student. I&amp;#39;ve been very confused about my sexuality, figuring I&amp;#39;m somewhere around bisexual or bi-favoring-men. I&amp;#39;m still closeted, but now that I am starting to feel comfortable with myself I would like to experiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Girl&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This girl is amazing, I haven&amp;#39;t crushed this hard for a female (or anyone) in a few years. She&amp;#39;s insanely attractive, funny, nerdy, and we share many interests. The problem is, she goes to school in a different state, so she&amp;#39;s only back home during breaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last time she was home was for winter break. Well, she&amp;#39;s an english major and heard I was writing a book, so she came over and we started talking. I invited her to a party at my fraternity, and later that night we were making out. We talked about going on a date, but sadly, I left for Christmas, and she was back at her school by the time I was back on campus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Guy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So a while back I tried out Grindr because I was curious in meeting guys. I normally just cruise for sex, but I started talking to this one guy just normal conversation. It was fun, and he gave me his number. About a week later, I delete grindr because there were no hot guys who were looking for no strings attached in my area. I took a chance and texted him after I deleted, saying I&amp;#39;d like to take him out for dinner that weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was my first date with a guy, and it was awesome. He&amp;#39;s cute, funny, educated, and confident in himself.

I recently (a couple months ago) started working out with a legitimate routine and have consistently been eating a surplus. Assuming I keep the consistency, I'm on track to become muscular. The only problem is, building mass takes years. I reckon that I won't be ""muscular"" until 2+ years from now because I started as very skinny.

I'm motivated and proud of my progress so far, but it makes me restless knowing that my ""life"" (sex life - dating, hooking up) cannot begin until I'm ""born"" in 2+ years (the point when I'm considered ""muscular""). I also feel sad that I wasted my 24th and 25th years by not starting this process a long time ago since those should be my peak years of attractiveness.

I went to a club recently, and I observed how the dance floor was divided into two classes - the muscular men with their shirts off and the rest of the people. Being that muscular guys are my type (I really like it when a guy is bigger and stronger than me), I couldn't help but stare over at them all longingly. I've gained some confidence from my progress so far, but I'm not even close to the point where I can approach a muscular guy, partly because of my low confidence and self esteem and partly because it's just obvious that they don't like skinny guys given that they almost exclusively socialize with other buff guys. It did make me happy knowing that I will be among them in a couple years, though.

Every day I'm super motivated to eat enough, and I look forward to my workouts more than anything. But day to day, while I know that each day is another closer to my eventual happiness, I feel restless knowing that there's nothing I can do to get there quicker. There's no point in trying to hook up or date now because I can't attract the guys I'm interested in. Should I just hook up with guys I'm not really attracted to now to practice sex for when I'm able to sleep with the guys I like? That feels like I'm using people, though.

I get that, but (or maybe perhaps because of that) I can't stop. OK, a little back story: I [26] met Josh [35] at the gym about a year ago. Off the bat, we both were on the same wave length, from work to extra curricular activities, we agreed on many subjects. Further, he's helped me get my life in order. He's gotten me interviews and my current job (no, we don't work for the same company). I'm really grateful for that. About 8 months ago, when we finished an early morning workout, we decided to head to the steam room. Conversation turned into our sexual history. He knew I was gay, I knew he was married. He told me about his teen years experimenting, I told him about my college years experimenting with girls (definitely not for me). We left the steam room, got changed, and headed our separate ways. About a week later, during out weekend workouts, we head back to the steam room and I share my recent sexual grindr experiences, while he tells me about his boring sex life. Of course, we both get aroused and we both jack it and the threat of being caught totally got us both off. Fast forward to about 3 months ago, after my company's Christmas party, I tell him to come pick me up from a bar and take me home. He comes, picks me up, and brings me home. I beg him to stay and sleep in bed with me. He does, but nothing happens that night. That morning, I wake up first and I work up and decided to blow him. He cums in my mouth, I swallow, he reciprocates, I blew my load, he spits. Since then, we've been getting together once a week and we've escalated from mutual blow jobs to full on bareback fucking. His wife knows nothing and whenever I attempt to broach the subject, he insists I stop. Today, I find out his wife's pregnant with his third child. I asked him if we should stop, he says no.

Anyways, our sex life has been kinda average- to okay. I don't really care about that, sex isn't really important because he's awesome, but there always seem to be a problem when it comes to sex with him? before that he just wasn't in the mood at all, couldn't watch porn while doing it because there was a legit incident when I saw him making a puking face when the guy was gagging in the video.... and now he's kinda getting repulsed by sex after he ejaculates so there's me just lying there and stuff. it's not that he gets lazy or selfish, he seems really disgusted or turned off. I try to finish first but he's always in a hurry so I'm not really sure what to do now.
