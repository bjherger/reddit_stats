It started with some casual stuff, i moved into some grey area of gay intent, and he responds with so much support that it makes me feel amazing, despite how awkwardly i handled it.

He called me to go golfing but it got a little too late, and was rather cold by the time we were off work anyway.  Last night i came up with the idea of seeing Interstellar again with someone and I was thinking it would be my ex but instead opportunity reared to spend some quality male-bonding time with a friend who really cares a lot about me.  

I love this kid.  When we first saw each other something happened in me that I understand now but had no idea how to process back them.  Freshly out of the 5th grade, first day of the 6th, there he is walking into the room.  He's short, and a little stocky, blond and with a really cool voice, dressed in pacsun and smelling like beach colognes.  He was so cool, i developed my first crush.  I originally thought it was just me being jealous that he was vying with me for the attention of our classmates, he was confident where i was shy, and outgoing where i was introverted.  I wanted to be him so bad.  

One of the first times i tried masturbating I thought of him.  I thought of him and how people talked about how good he looks now, and how he has always struggled with his weight, going from being a muscular jock to having a plump belly and back again.  I remember being so turned on seeing his tummy rolls in his shirt, and how popular he was even though he was a little chunky.  He helped me realize i had a sort of fetish for this, which is a huge part of who i am sexually whether i like/want it or not.  He was what i wanted to become.

He is a short guy.  Hes just so cute.  He always has a beaming smile between those soft cheeks and his pale blue, cheery eyes.  We always had the same shoe size so we actually would trade skate shoes back when thats all anyone wore.  He was always kind to me but would give me a good razzing just like anyone else, which made me feel included as one of the guys for the first time in my life.  I remember being so happy that we got in a little tussle in the locker room one day that ended with us hugging, i came home from school and cried and laughed and felt alive for the first time.  I was starting to realize that i was gay, I wasnt just waiting for my like-girls feelings to start: those were never going to come.  

I was always horny around him, though, and i learned that the best way to not impose myself on anyone lest they discover enough about me to accuse me of being gay, so I learned to hide myself away.  I stopped hanging out with people and started doing drugs by the time high school started, and had developed into doing heroin every day by the 10th grade.  

By the 11th grade we were running into each other again, because we were wrapped up in the same shit.  My wish started coming true, he and I were becoming a team, even if it was for the wrong reasons we were in contact and building a relationship.  We have so many memories now we can go back to and reflect on, how hard life was for us and how we propped each other up while even being worlds apart, considering how unwilling i was to let the true me out.  

College came and just this year has gone, we live back in our city again.  We are hanging out a little but today was different.  Today I decided to re-visit the drugs even though we both are off that shit, just to re-visit the mindset where we left off.  It was amazing, we picked right back up.  Only this time I let myself be gay.

But what im worried about is that I was taking it too far, imposing my feelings on him.  I was afraid I was making him uncomfortable like I feel about how I make everyone and the whole world feel being gay.  He told me that wasnt true, so i opened up more and told him that I struggle with my body image cause i could be so ripped and cut if i just put in a decent effort, and at the same time want a nice big, fully filled out rack of muscles and meat rippling all over me.  He shared that sentiment and went on to explain how he thinks how uncomfortable I feel being gay in a lesser way translates to how uncomfortable he feels being fat.  Which - he is not fat, he just thinks he is - is not a problem as much for him he would admit, but he was right I think, he knows what its like to ostracize oneself for the sake of not wanting to even bring ones own shame around to darken the spirits of those around you.  

I explained that this is the reasoning behind our feelings and he was impressed and very open with me about talking about gay stuff.  That felt amazing, not having to hear ""ew"" or ""gross"" when im talking about the stuff that stirs my heart.  We get to the theater and I request a special long hug.  I nuzzle my face into his neck and he giggles.  ""Its alright man, Im your bro youve got me and I want you to come to me when you feel like this, we are gonna get thru this"" he replies.  

We make our way through the mall and are talking about taking up a fitness regiment in order to fulfill our destinies of having ideally sculpted bodies.  He makes a few jokes about gay porn, and how cute we would look when we are out hangin with each other.  Inside I worry that as cool as we could look as soon as I open my mouth anyone that hears me talk is going to know that underneath my big tough oaf body is a really, really, just really so-gay boy.  I am really gay, if it werent for the passion i have for my work I would be trying to just be the biggest slut i could be.  I cant help it when my cock occasionally rules my emotions, im powerless to the intensity of those feelings.

Especially because I go so often so long without any kind of gay fulfillment, like how I have turned 24 but havent had sex in two years.  He tells me he understands and its ok, he thinks alot with his cock too.  I love it when he talks like that.  We get into the theater, he's bought my ticket so i buy him a snack.  Now i am starting to overflow.  The repressed lifetime of urges, needs, wishes, and dreams well up and burgeon to crack the composure of my facade.  

I give him the old ""youre the best man, youre number one, i love you man"" routine as i put my arm around his shoulder.  He smiles and laughs his big laugh and I continue searching his body with my hands.  I talk about our workout plan (in nice and slow detail) as i move from his shoulders to rub his neck, then back to give the shoulders a squeeze.  I glide around the biceps and i let him compare his to mine, i think his are bigger than mine,  and before i can bring myself to realize what im doing my hands reach over to squeeze his chest in a way that would almost certainly palpate my nipples.  He giggles and peels my hands off, and goes on about how he cant wait to give the the self love and satisfaction that comes from working out together, as two guys who take on the responsibility to be looking out for each other's health and to inspire each other to be the best they can be.  

And he tells me that the best i can be is just as gay as i am, just fine the way i am.  He tells me he was so thrilled when i first heard i came out, especially since it was right after his 21st birthday when he was too drunk to take care of himself and on the verge of blacking out and out of hundreds of friends to save him he calls me.  He calls me to come save him from his own party.  In the car he breaks down and is crying to me about how people take advantage of his kindness.  He tells me he wishes he was me and that he had my intelligence and asks if we can go talk on the seawall on the tidal surge beach in his neighborhood.  

When we get there, when we sit down he starts to cry.  He grabs me and holds me and pulls at my shirt and begs me to tell him how i think about him and if hes been an alright friend to me.  I tell him how important he was to me on becoming a person and he goes flush with rosy embarrassment.  He knew i actually did care about him that much, and wasnt just putting him on like all the others for a good time since his parents have money.  

He tells me he loves me, i tell him I love him.  Now in the present we are doing the same thing again.  ""I love you man"", ""youre an amazing, special guy"".  I think we are both just sweet people who want to be cared for as much as we care for each other.  If only he knew that finding my best friend would either be as easy as finding him right in front of me, or in another world and dimension parallel to this one, hanging above the endless black as a taunt.

And i know my limitations, im not here to say that im in love with the straight guy oh woe is me he will never love me back.  Im here to say im totally fine with that, with this, with whatever is going on because it is amazing and real and beautiful and personally brilliantly reflected against each other.  Its a far cry from the experience i have around gay people - who usually leave me either hating myself, hating the world, or hating my own kind.  Gay culture doesnt seem to ever have had a place for me so i just opt out.  

He lifts up his shirt and lets me run my fingers through his happy trail, across his little belly and he tells me how he wants to lose it, I feel silly getting the biggest hard on of my life, like i can feel the veins throbbing through my corduroy.  I take a handful of his tummy and he smiles and tells me that he thinks hes just a pig but its ok cause hes got me.  He does, and thats fine with me.  Ive always loved him, in a way ive always sort of lived my life with some shadow of him over me.   And now hes bringing me up to his level, hes taking my hand and bringing me into the manhood ive always craved, the world of the male form and all that is involved in making it.

He listens on bated breath for the whole movie as I have to explain the physics from basic forces to relativity, to theory and the fifth dimension (as its put int he movie, the artifacts left over from love).  Hes not gay, but he lets me be as gay as i want with him.  I wont kiss him or anything, i respect him too much, but i am so captivated and entranced and swept away at his beauty and sexiness when he lets me play with his body a bit, and lets us both admire what we are as men together, holding each other over and over whenever we get a little second.  

I buy him dinner, he sits on the same side of the booth as me.  Hes shy to finish the burrito but he sees me devour mine and pat my tummy and he offers to give me the rest of his.  In a way, i know he gets me.  Hes always been there for me and ive just been too wrapped up in trying to understand what it means to be gay that im not giving myself a chance to do anything where i feel it, and while highly non-traditional, i believe we have an amazing relationship.  i love him and i wouldnt have it any other way.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tonight i had a really unique experience with one of my best friends i have known for a very long time, since we were in middle school twelve years ago.

I'm a 20 year-old university student from Texas. Idk what's wrong with me. I have a pretty good life in terms of outside appearances. I live at home with my mother and siblings (farther died in a workplace accident in 2012, but was a great father). Closeted, to them, but not my ""friends"". I go to school. I try to get good grades but I'm a terrible procrastinator so I'm only avg. (3.43 GPA, accounting major). I don't have a job because I think I don't want one and I tell myself school is my work. I should be so thankful that I've never needed anything, in terms of physical possessions) and overall my childhood was good. Wow this is becoming a wall of text. Sorry.

I'm probably still high on Molly right now since I keep chewing gum incessantly. I have exactly one real friend that I don't see often enough. It doesn't matter what the drug of choice is, I always end up embarrassing myself or making everyone around me depressed. Every single time. She tries to bring me out to social events when she can buy I always have a negative experience. I thought i was going to be rolling and super happy but I turned out to be so depressing to everyone. We went to a school sponsored rave kind of thing but holy shit was I stiff. My friend and her boyfriend were the first to notice me being a downer and then I feel like I dragged down our group within like 30 minutes. Then they decided to call it quits and go ""feed their dogs"" (code for we want to party somewhere else, but your not invited). It was for the better to part ways and not bring everyone down with me.

I've never have thought about suicide nor will I ever. Could I still be depressed? I was a peppy child and very talkative but as I grew into my teens, I made a 180 and never looked back. Timid, introverted, and a grotesque amount of acne. I'm heavily scarred and have been since I was 13. I feel funny saying this, but I honestly don't think my facial features are ugly but my terrible atrophic scaring that covers every millimeter of my face makes me monstrous. Dude at the rave was giving personal light shows in your face but when he saw me he stopped giving them. 

I'm so lonely. I don't know who to turn to. What's wrong with me? How can I turn things around? I'm desperate to be a happier person but I just hate myself right now and have been for a long time, in hindsight. If you've made it this far, then thank you for reading. I know it was long, but it just feels good to write all of this down. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi gaybros. I&amp;#39;m a 20 year-old university student from Texas.

I try to get good grades but I&amp;#39;m a terrible procrastinator so I&amp;#39;m only avg. (3.43 GPA, accounting major). I don&amp;#39;t have a job because I think I don&amp;#39;t want one and I tell myself school is my work. I should be so thankful that I&amp;#39;ve never needed anything, in terms of physical possessions) and overall my childhood was good. Wow this is becoming a wall of text. Sorry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m probably still high on Molly right now since I keep chewing gum incessantly. I have exactly one real friend that I don&amp;#39;t see often enough. It doesn&amp;#39;t matter what the drug of choice is, I always end up embarrassing myself or making everyone around me depressed. Every single time. She tries to bring me out to social events when she can buy I always have a negative experience. I thought i was going to be rolling and super happy but I turned out to be so depressing to everyone. We went to a school sponsored rave kind of thing but holy shit was I stiff. My friend and her boyfriend were the first to notice me being a downer and then I feel like I dragged down our group within like 30 minutes. Then they decided to call it quits and go &amp;quot;feed their dogs&amp;quot; (code for we want to party somewhere else, but your not invited). It was for the better to part ways and not bring everyone down with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never have thought about suicide nor will I ever. Could I still be depressed? I was a peppy child and very talkative but as I grew into my teens, I made a 180 and never looked back. Timid, introverted, and a grotesque amount of acne. I&amp;#39;m heavily scarred and have been since I was 13. I feel funny saying this, but I honestly don&amp;#39;t think my facial features are ugly but my terrible atrophic scaring that covers every millimeter of my face makes me monstrous. Dude at the rave was giving personal light shows in your face but when he saw me he stopped giving them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m so lonely. I don&amp;#39;t know who to turn to. What&amp;#39;s wrong with me? How can I turn things around? I&amp;#39;m desperate to be a happier person but I just hate myself right now and have been for a long time, in hindsight. If you&amp;#39;ve made it this far, then thank you for reading. I know it was long, but it just feels good to write all of this down. &lt;/p&gt;

Honestly, I was just clicking through the random button and found this sub. Feel free to remove it if needed.

My question is essentially, how do you feel about the church? 

Here's my background. I'm a 37 year old who is a Christian and was just recently ordained as a pastor. I'm also a returning college student at a mid-sized state university with a large LGBT community. I personally find no offense with anyone's lifestyle and am a proponent of equal marriage rights, but I know that's not the case with a lot of my (misguided) brethren. 

I'm not ashamed to talk about my faith when it's relevant to a conversation so most of my classmates know I'm Christian. I've got several gay classmates, and I've noticed that a couple of them are pretty stand-offish towards me (I'm a social guy and tend to greet people a lot, but get the cold shoulder from these two). It's entirely possible that these guys are just jerks or stuck up, but I can't help but feeling that it's prejudice because of my faith (not that I'd really blame them).

Anyway, i don't really have much of a point other than just general curiosity. Thanks for reading my ramble, and I'd genuinely love to hear your thoughts.

I came out my friends. I started meeting guys. I got on track with school. 

But I'm not better. I still feel like I hate myself for being gay. Most times i'm OK with it. But I still feel like I can't be myself around my friends and definitely not family considering they don't know.

I've gone back and forth will telling my family but I just can't. It's just created this massive void between us. My parents are divorced which actually is pretty hard. I've seen how much my mom and dad struggled (even separated) to take care of us. They sacrificed everything for us but we still saw, money is everything. I lived with my mom and sister but I moved out a few months ago for my last year of undergrad. My dad I barely see (even though he pines to see me all the time) since I was around 18.  The void is 50x worse now. 

Being on my own hasn't really changed much of anything. I can't get close to my family. My grandfather passed recently and it was like I didn't even care. I went to his wake and I felt like a stranger. An alien. With my own family I am just a ghost. With my friends it's all just an act. I'm not really there. The real me feels some kind of dream. I don't even know what ""the real me"" even means anymore.

I don't feel I can accomplish anything. School is going bad again. I failed out of my major last year and now I'm taking a consolation prize major. I don't trust my abilities. I feel weak, I feel worthless.  I think about life after college and all I see is failing and disappearing. Seeing my family's faces after they see the facade crumbling down in the end. 

I either fuck random guys or I get close to guys and then never see them again. I don't return their calls or texts, I disappear to them. Don't really know how else to be. 

A lot of the time I feel like none of it really matters, ya know? You live and you die like everyone else. There's no guarantees that you will ever be happy and life isn't fair. Without money, you have nothing. And with money, you could still be hollow. Life doesn't care about your feelings, your family, or anything. Life is indifferent. You could be born a child slave or you could be gay in Saudi Arabia. You could be born and dashed against stones. But I wasn't.

I'm 19 and I grew up in a Christian house hold. We based our views on the conservative/Christian beliefs. I come from a broken home where my parents were divorced and my Dad died 4 years ago. We didn't have a good relationship when he died. Now it's just my mother and I. She grew up fearing God and when something happens in the news (like gay merrage), she talks bad about gays. She says that ""this country is going to pot and this world is turning evil."" Shes not very fond of them. 


I wasn't always attracted to guys and it feels like it's more a gradual thing. I was attracted to women and always classified as it, but I also watched gay porn at the same time. For the past few years, I've been completely turned on by gay porn and started looking at guys in a different light. I started noticing them more, and I'm also fond of the idea of being loved by a guy. I've also have explored with prostate/butt play and I love it. I should note that I'm also a virgin and never been in a relationship. 

I'm really confused and in my religon, it's not really favored upon. Idon't want to go to hell, but I also don't want to repress these feelings of wanting love from a guy. Im still fond of the idea of having a wife, but I'm not attracted to women. Now I would have to change my viewpoint on my future? Since I'm so confused, I havnt made any advances towards anyone as far as dating goes.

I did the deed. I slept poorly the night before. I couldn't eat lunch. I was apprehensive all day at work. My heart wouldn't slow down. But I told them. I didn't allow myself time for the moment to slip by and I said it with very little fluff.

The first friend, his response after making sure I was serious was to say everything is okay and we're still friends. He was a little shocked, but we talked a lot about the details (when I knew, why I said nothing, how it works, etc) and I was able to be open and honest with him about everything.

I told the second friend a few hours later over the phone. His response was ""this changes absolutely nothing"". It was such a non-event for him that it made it foolish to feel nervous in the first place. He wasn't as suprised, but like before I was able to speak frankly and explain how hurt I was and he was very cool about everything.

Overall, I've never been more scared in my life but it felt good to get that out. I can't help but relate these experiecnes to when I came out to my ex as it's such a stark difference. There was no condemnation, expactation to change, or lecture on how I'm falling into death and destruction. I finally told someone I actually cared about and didn't feel like a piece of shit and wanting to die afterwards.

Thank you guys for the encouraging words. It was helpful to read them to give me that extra push. I'm still fighting feelings of self worth and I still feel ill thinking of coming out to my religious family but it feels good to know that I have at least two friends that support me no matter what.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Update to &lt;a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/2mn7yc/coming_out_to_best_friends_soon/""&gt;this previous post&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

There was no condemnation, expactation to change, or lecture on how I&amp;#39;m falling into death and destruction. I finally told someone I actually cared about and didn&amp;#39;t feel like a piece of shit and wanting to die afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you guys for the encouraging words. It was helpful to read them to give me that extra push. I&amp;#39;m still fighting feelings of self worth and I still feel ill thinking of coming out to my religious family but it feels good to know that I have at least two friends that support me no matter what.&lt;/p&gt;

I've been questioning myself for years. Not being out and having no one to relate to, I frequented this subreddit a lot. After a girlfriend of some time dumped me, I mustered up the courage to make an OkCupid account with bi status. This was my experience:

After a few failed (more like aborted) dates, I finally found a nice guy at my university. Cute, geeky, dresses well, aspiring doctor - he was also closet both to his family and in mannerism. We had a lot in common. Our first date was a brief lunch so we we could assess the other for authenticity and non-serial-killer-ness. I was incredibly anxious about the second date (which we put off because of exams) and could barely focus. Eventually we both met up for a sit-down dinner date and got sushi at a local outlet mall. Afterwards, we decided to walk and talk. Near this place is a pretty upscale, towering Mormon church, which neither of us had ever been to. We made it our mission to break in. Just for the irony of it. We snuck in as far as we could without having to hop some cinder-block fences or run into Mitt Romney. There we found grassy little spot to chill.

Up until that point, it didn't feel at all like a ""gay"" date. But then I got to talk about things I've never expressed to anyone else. What it was like to feel invisible, fall for your straight friends, have impossible fantasies. At that point, it got a little touchy and we kissed. It was comparable to my first date with a girl: awkward, giggly, electrifying - but different. I was used to soft skin, hips and curves. He was firm, squared, bearded. When we made out I didn't know where to put my hands! I'm not sure if it was the sacrilegious of it all or the years of pent-up sexual frustration, but at that point it definitely did get/feel gay.

Afterwards, I just felt kind of elated. It was a little awkward waiting at the bus stop brushing the dirt off our clothes, both of us acting like nothing had happened, but I had a fat grin on that I couldn't shake. So there you have it. My first shameless gay-fling was in the trees by the parking lot of a Mormon church. But fuck it, it felt right. I'm excited for whatever comes next and just wanted to share it with you all!

I want to be one of those healthy, successful gay men that I always see on okcupid. They seem to love their jobs and have enough money to spend and live in good areas of the city. How do I get my shit together?

What are some employable skills I could learn for free while working that would enable me to make money? I am thinking of learning how to code, but would be happy to hear suggestions. Should I even consider going back to university at this age? I know I wouldn't be able to get into a good one and I would accumulate debt so I'm trying not to.

Now I'm really tired of being angry with her, but she's given me no opportunity to forgive her. What can I do?

I come from a pretty close-knit family, and generally speaking I love them. They're warm and kind, and barring a two-year gap after I came out at 19, I've maintained really close ties to them. I was always especially close with my younger sister. When I started dating my husband, he got along really well with all of my family, and he was extremely supportive of all of us when my grandparents died or when my mother fell ill. He really makes an effort to be close to my family (e.g. he talks almost daily with my mum on f*cebook, he makes us go visit them way more frequently than I would...).

When DH asked me to marry him, I was obviously stoked, but when I told my mum she didn't react as stokedly as I did (I believe she said ""well, that's really hard news to hear."") Sh*tty, but not entirely unexpected. In fact, I told Husband that I didn't even intend to ask my folks to the wedding (he asked them; they said no), but that I was sure my brother and sister would come. Brother said he &amp; s-i-l would make it, but no reply from little sister. When I pressed her on the subject (like ""hey, why haven't you responded to my wedding invitation?"") she left me a truly wretched voicemail where she said, in part, ""I feel like coming to your wedding would be supporting it, and I don't support your marriage.""

Naturally I was gutted, and a wreck for a while.

The wedding was absolutely perfect; in attendance were my new parents-in-law, my new siblings-in-law, my brother, his wife, and my two close friends. (It was the shortest wedding I've ever been to, and possibly also the cheapest; I think the final outlay was around $300.) It was a beautiful ceremony and totally sweet and not having my whole family there didn't diminish it too much (or at least, I didn't think about it too much).

But that was almost a year ago, and I'm still really really angry with my sister. Phone calls went from ~2/week to 0. Every time I see her (probably once a month at family functions) I feel ill and can't help but picture her saying she doesn't support my marriage.

I can tell she regrets the change in our relationship, but she hasn't asked for forgiveness (probably because she thinks she did the right thing). While I hope she sees her mistake some day, I'm definitely not holding my breath. But I'm really tired of being so angry with her, and I want to forgive her. At the same time, I feel like going back to being besties would be like saying it was okay to treat me and my husband with such disrespect.

How can I repair our relationship, even though she hasn't asked for forgiveness?

Im 22 was born in Brazil and moved to Germany for my studies 2 years ago and after 6 months here I meet him. 
The past times with him was just amazing we traveled a lot he was in Brazil meet my family my friends and we traveled together like crazy and he helps me support me and is a kinf guy.
Im always feel very insecurity about him, his family friends doenst know about him, I never came to get in contact with anybody of his friends and family in his own country it upsets me for a long time but I had enought of discutions he always told me that it would take time to face it but one day it would come I support and love him for who he is and in some point I just decided that I wouldnt get in this anymore may not be easy for him either to take this decision so I just decided to live with that not having contact with his ""real life"" and accept that I need to live on the world that he creat for us.

Second Part: Im living alone here in Germany he has his own appartment and I have mine I always wanted to live with him many times I showed this for him and asked for it and one point he decided that we could do it he was ready but then he steped back and decided to dont do it anymore cause he was not ready....ok here I go again accepting to live with that.

2 times I had the chance to back to Brazil and finish my studies cause here in Germany I cannot do it anymore and If I do it I have to begin from the 0 so it will take much more time of my life and all the times that we cought ourserlfs about what to do of my life he asked me to stay and we would do it even if it takes too long he would be by my side with me. 

My boyfriend works a lot and if he is not working he is meeting his friends in the begining of the relashionship I always felt that he was always planing a lot to meet with me was just not natural It was one of his appointments of his agenda...some point of our relashionship we were really seeing each other often cause I was complaning about the time together and in some point it was just natural and I could feel that was naturally but since a time I go really feel that is not naturally anymore I just became again is very well planned agenda. 

I really love him but I dont feel I have space in his life in some hand I have everything I need from him and in another hand I dont have nothing I always feel very lonely Im at home in a friday night he was sick all week and we didnt meet at all and when he is feeling better he will meet his friends people that I even know and I will never get to know.
I feel sick I barely can sleep when he is out I think that he is doing something to hurt me even if he is not I feel such unsafe but I such love him. 
I feel I dont want to live with that anymore I want pack my stuffs and just move somewhere else Im tired to try to get in to him he is so cold. 
But when I look back I feel I should give more chances to him but at the same time I dont wanna be the person anymore who is complaning about things. 
Thats love?
I feel so lost, weak I dont wanna loose him and at the same time I dont wanna suffer anymore cause after a while insecurity is starting to kill me. 
but just to look at him make me forget about averything and saying to myself when I walkway I will be a better boyfriend but when I get at home I feel like shit. 
what can I do?

I'm 25 and I've had one sort of meaningful relationship (for me anyways) and I'm so incredibly frustrated as to what I should do with my life and where its going. This is an incredibly conservative town and I wait tables for a living. I absolutely hate waiting tables. When I worked in the oilfield I was a service tech for a company that installed and maintained sewer systems for rig housing, sort of like an oilfield plumber, except that all of the equipment that we worked on was above ground and transportable...so we didn't quite do any kind of work that would translate to a residential or even most other commercial settings and it was a pretty simple, crude but effective approach to plumbing. 

I loved it. I love working outside and the environment didn't scare me a bit. (Aside-  If you ever get a chance to see a rig move I highly recommend it. so cool) I do have some horror stories but for the most part it was honest work for an honest wage. The problem was that it wasn't going to ever get me anything other than oilfield work and I worked 16, sometimes even 20 hour days. I had a 24 once and I started seeing things on the drive home. 

I really started to feel like I was missing out on something and I could barely maintain my friendships, much less meet anyone who was willing to look past being married to my job. I decided to go back to waiting tables....and shifted my focus from what was coming out of people to what was going into them. It was fine for awhile but I hate the irregular paychecks and its difficult for me to budget with that kind of income. 

And I found that out here, I'm not really missing out on anything but I decided not to go back. I'd really like to go to a trade school and pick up either a job as a welder or an electrician so that I can have the opportunity to move to a different place. I have my heart set on Seattle ... or...anywhere really. 

I tried waiting in San Antonio for a bit to see if maybe living in a more gay friendly city would help me get over a rough breakup and maybe make waiting tables more bearable and it didn't. I want to work. I want something physical and I want to take a step back at the end of the day and know that I fixed a leak for a terrified housewife or built something that will outlive myself. I decided to come back home after a few months and go to a trade school- I can live with my parents and I found a night job that will be perfect for it. But I'm still not happy here. In fact, I'd describe myself as completely miserable. 

I know that I have 2 options- stay here for 2 more years and deal...go to trade school....possibly find a job somewhere that I wouldn't mind being (although I can see that it might be difficult without properly networking) 

Or try it again. In a place where I can grow personally, be able to be open at my school, my job, in a restaurant, in public. 

When I came out I decided that I wouldn't let my sexuality determine anything about my life other than who I slept with but it's much more complicated than I thought. How do I decide between a fulfilling career and a happy personal life?

Of course it isn't so cut and dry. There are some issues that I left out, but that's the biggest struggle that I'm having right now. Sorry for the novel, it just feels good to talk about this stuff sometimes.

Before I begin, I'd like to say that this is the 3rd time I ask a question here.

This has become sort of a ""blog"" for me, because I feel I can express myself on this sub, and since I come here when I'm troubled, it helps when you guys give me your advice. 

You guys always say the true things, even though they usually hurt and I don't want to hear them, but they really help me, so thanks for that.


START READING HERE:


I'm an attractive 20 year old guy. I hook up about once or twice a week with guys from Grindr, and I'm very open about my sexuality. 

This does not mean I don't want a boyfriend. It's just that for some reason, I can't stand the formal dating structure, of going on dates, with unwritten rules, things you can't say etc. I usually get really bored of them. Another reason I don't like it (and that's the more significant one) is that I'm usually put in a set of expectation which freak me out, because I'm afraid I'll hurt the other guy, and I hate hurting people.

My latest Ex, whom I still am not completely over (I wrote about him in my last post here), actually became my boyfriend only after we were friends with benefits, and the one before that as well.

Over the past few months, I've been trying to find a boyfriend. I want to fall in love. I want to have sex with someone I love again. That was the best feeling in the world. But the problem is, the guys who want a relationship seem too ""boring"" and ""normal"" for me, and I quickly lose interest.

The guys I develop a crush on are these guys I meet from Grindr:

We say in advance we're not looking for a specific thing, that we'll start from meeting each other and ""go with the flow"" (that usually means have sex) and if the chemistry is good there's no reason we won't end up together (like my Ex....)

But sadly, too many times I meet with a guy, we have a nice talk/dinner/whatever type of ice breaker, and then we have amazing sex. Somehow that makes me ""attached"" to them, and then they are suddenly scared, get cold feet and it's the last time we meet. Basically I run them away.

I understand my flaws. If I want a serious relationship, I shouldn't be looking for sex dates on Grindr. But my problem is I can't bring myself to go on more than a few dates with the ""serious"" guys who want a relationship as much as I do, because they always develop expectations of me which freak me out and I end up hurting them either way.

Is there anyone here who knows what I'm talking about? Who has these problems as well? Feel free to tell me anything that's on your mind. I do not claim to be a good and right person. I just love people and I hate hurting and deluding them.

TL;DR:

I want a relationship, but I only feel comfortable meeting and going out with guys who prefer sex and not being tied down to a relationship.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Short Disclaimer, skip to START READING HERE if not interested :)&lt;/p&gt;

I have an estranged father that has been in prison since I was an infant. After getting my heart broken a couple of months ago; I didn't really have a place to talk about my feelings, and since I carried a lot of resent towards him I decided to write him a letter asking to start fresh with a man that I felt should have always been in my life.

Fast forward a couple of weeks and we're pen pals. I love the feeling of getting to know my father but I feel like he won't completely know me until I come out to him. This is the complicated part; since this is something that I've waited and wanted my entire life, I don't know if I could handle the rejection of my father and not having him in my life again.

People have told me ""It'll go back to before."" as in not having a relationship with him again, but I don't think they understand that now that I have a relationship. I don't want to let it go. 

That being said he seems really nice, and like he wants to get to know me. He was in a gang and has been in prison for the last 19 years. I don't know how he'll take the news of his only son being gay. I want to tell him because I don't think I can fully open up to him and be who I am unless I tell him. It is apart of the very fabric of who I am and I am very proud of who I am.

TLDR; My estranged father is in jail, and I want to come out to him, but I don't want to risk the new relationship we have.

I've met a few guys that I've really liked, but I don't think that I am in a place right now where I want to be in a serious relationship. So, I met this guy, M, on one of the apps, and we've been hanging out pretty regularly for the past 2ish weeks. He's a really nice guy, and we get along really well. He has made it quite obvious that he has caught feelings for me, and that has kinda scared me away a bit from him. Like I said, great guy, but I don't think I am wanting a relationship with him, and... to be honest... I don't find him all that attractive... :/ I really want to be friends with him, but the idea of being serious is not something I want to consider, since I know it will only lead to us breaking up and him hating me.

So, anyways. While M has been wanting me, I've still been using the apps, and met up with a couple other guys. Just recently I met a new guy, R, and we have hit it off amazingly well. Like, it is insane. I really like R, and he apparently really likes me, and I want to kinda have a slightly serious thing with him, or at least a thing where we can continue what we're doing on the regular.

I'm supposed to go to a movie with M tonight. The last few times we've hung out, I have made it obvious that I don't want to kiss or hold hands, or be affectionate with him, though I haven't outright said that. 

TL;DR- I feel like a hypocrite since I do not want to be in a relationship with M, but want something with R. How can I still be friends with M, and not hurt his feelings? Am I an asshole for liking someone else, when someone is so clearly infatuated with me? Ugh!

So here's a little about me and what's happening in my life:

I'm a 20 year old college student. I'm out to some good friends but not a lot of people. People don't really expect that I'm gay and I'm pretty bad about just being able to tell about other people so lately I've been using grindr. At first it was mostly just to get laid but now I'm really looking for a relationship. So I met up with a guy that I really liked. He was really cute, we smoked weed, played some video games, hooked up and I slept over. I was thinking this is finally what I'd been looking for. So I texted him a few times the next few days after and he didn't respond to any of them. Except when I asked to hang out and watch the new episode of American Horror Story and he told me he was busy. 

So that left me feeling pretty shitty and with a lot of questions. Is he done with me and was just interested in a one time hookup? I'm wondering if I should keep trying with him or not. Advice with that would be awesome. Then I started wondering if anyone ever successfully finds relationships on grindr? If you have any stories please share with me. I'm just confused about grindr etiquette and if I'm wasting my time on there. Also what are good non-internet strategies for meeting other gay guys? I would really appreciate advice or stories from you guys on here Thanks!
