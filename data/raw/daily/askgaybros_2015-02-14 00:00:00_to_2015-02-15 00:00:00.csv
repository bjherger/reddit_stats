This is my first real relationship. I've only been dating at all for a year. So that's important to take into consideration. We met on Tinder, I'm gay. He's bi, been in a lot of relationships with men and women.

Anyway, he told me he loved me after only a few dates, maybe a month into dating. I told him I wasn't quite ready for that, I was still figuring myself out. More importantly, I believe that when you say something like that, you should be willing to really follow up - to do it, to really love someone. I was in the midst of frequent dating and told him I wasn't sure. He is very much the sort of cliche romantic person and I am very much not. I explained as much to him and explained I didn't think that I'd make a great boyfriend, but that I really did like him and would like to continue dating him. I told him that he should date other people. But as time went on and we got more attached, my dating slowed down significantly.

Fast-forward another month or two, things are going well. It's my birthday, I have school and work all day. He had been having a hard time the night before. He kept saying how hard it was that i didn't love him back, that I was the only one for him. Said he'd do anything for me. We messaged a bit earlier, and I told him that I just wanted to talk later when i got out of class late. We agreed we'd call each other later. I hurried out and called to know answer, messaged, only got a quick reply saying 'later' when later rolled around after midnight, he said he couldn't talk.

The next day I asked if he wanted to meet me at school. He said sure, but then last minute had me meet him at a bar. Eventually got out that he had been with a guy the night before, and later found out they did oral. It kinda hurt. But I mean I knew we weren't exclusive or anything. It just hurt that he promised to talk and then blew it off.

Similar thing happened a week later, we both have tight schedules so we have to plan out when we can see each other. He was gonna meet me, ended up coming almost two hours late because he had been out at bar again drinking. Turns out he had hooked up with a guy again. He went on a couple more dates in the following month, but said that they didn't do anything. My dating had pretty much stopped, I really liked him and was happy.

Few more weeks go by, Christmastime. Went over to bring him a gift day before Christmas. Late on Christmas Eve I told him that I'd like to give a relationship a shot. So bam, official, off we go.

Just recently I found out that one of his later dates that he had done oral with the guy. I only found this out because I implied that he had already told me and he went along telling me, although he had explictly told me before that he only kissed the guy. Turns out that the night I brought him a gift he did oral with another guy that he ""didn't even like"" but 'he bought him dinner, so felt obligated.'

So...now we've been official two months. And I don't think he's done anything, he's been faithful. But it's just hard for me. He did stuff so frequently with guys. He drinks all the time. And likes drinking alone, like if we say we'll meet at a bar he'll go there hours earlier than me. I always have to drag information out of him about what he did with guys. He's a great guy but communication is so hard. I've been having a really hard day and messaged him earlier but he hasn't responded, although he just posted a picture drinking at his house with a ladyfriend. But when he's having a hard time I always go out of my way to be there, but lots of the time it seems like he doesn't want to talk to me anyway. I just didn't think a relationship would feel so lonely, you know?

So the communication is hard, but I'm aware that that's a two way street. Point is...I feel like it's a ticking time bomb until he cheats on me. I just think how he's reacted when things were hard before - running off for a hookup, drinking. Sex seems so meaningless to him, if he just does it because he feels obligated when someone buys him a meal and he doesn't even like the guy, what's to stop it from happening when it's someone he likes? And he just always drinks and I know how much more likely mistakes are to happen when you're drunk. So am I being too controlling or paranoid? I'm aware that it could be the situation but just all these little things hurt, as embarrassing as that is to admit.

If I'm in the wrong, I mean, he hasn't done anything...how do I shake this feeling? Like right now all I know he's drinking and that he hasn't responded, and my mind just goes to what could be happening. I don't want to live being paranoid like this. I don't want to take it out on him because he hasn't necessarily done anything wrong. I brought it up to him a couple weeks ago after I found out that he lied about the one guy and asked him to explain his mindset or whatever to me, because we're different and that's ok, but he never really explained. I don't really feel like I fit in in the gay world. I'm not 'stereotypical gay' and he is and stupid as it is it kinda makes things hard sometimes. I really like him, I'm just confused. It's just hard and I hope someone can help me work through this. Thanks.

tl;dr: Feel like my BF doesn't communicate, and that cheating is inevitable.

For the second night, which I just got home from, we were at his place and for the first time in privacy. We talked a little more about my little debacle. One thing led to another and he gave me oral. I'm feeling some sexual attraction after tonight I think. The main issue for me is that I have a hard time kissing and doing foreplay. I told him this, so for the rest of the night we were groping each other and having ""hot and heavy"" make outs. I like how it went, and with time I think I can like it even more.

Need some help here!

I was in a really great two year relationship that ended because I had to travel (my visa expired, wasn't my choice). It was a really sad but beautiful ending to a great relationship and I think we still both very much have feelings for each other.

Issue is when I left we (stupidly, in hindsight) still kept in touch and said quasi-romantic things to each other. When my ex however started to see this other guy fairly quickly after I left (he met him three days after I left and they kissed three weeks after I left), I did NOT take it well. I guess a combination of relocation issues (loss of friends, had to live with family, re-enter the closet, working life as opposed to uni life, etc, etc.) and the break-up was just too much for me. I blamed him for being really insensitive and just moving on too fast. And I guess the way he did some things and some things that he said to me were pretty hurtful. So things got messy and we stopped talking to each other for a while.

I called him on New Years and we kinda sorted things out. I guess it helped that I finally moved on. We now talk on a very occasional basis and I think we both want very much to be friends. And last month, our friendship was going pretty well. 

Lately, however, he's been messaging me more frequently. I guess it's because I'm returning to visit London for two weeks next week. But he also told me that he broke up with the rebound. 

I don't know how to respond to this. When I go back to London, we kinda expect to see each other. I have to collect some things from his house (lol). And I guess we have loads of mutual friends so we'll definitely be getting tipsy together.

I don't know guys. I've worked so hard to get out of depression and move on from how betrayed I felt because of him. But, tbh, him telling me he's now single made me so happy. Of course it did. I still have feelings for him, heck I still love him. I'm an irrational stupid stupid boy!

What do you think I should do when I get there? Stay away? I don't think that's an option for I don't have self-control. Do you think I should allow for something to happen? If it does, how do I prepare myself from not regressing to depression when I get back?

I still love him. Loads. Before I left we talked about the possibility of being together in the distant-future. That hope is always going to be with me. I'm returning to London in 2 years. 

Do I let it all go? Or just go with the flow? :) THANKS IN ADVANCE!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys! Need some help here!&lt;/p&gt;

I guess a combination of relocation issues (loss of friends, had to live with family, re-enter the closet, working life as opposed to uni life, etc, etc.) and the break-up was just too much for me. I blamed him for being really insensitive and just moving on too fast. And I guess the way he did some things and some things that he said to me were pretty hurtful. So things got messy and we stopped talking to each other for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I called him on New Years and we kinda sorted things out. I guess it helped that I finally moved on. We now talk on a very occasional basis and I think we both want very much to be friends. And last month, our friendship was going pretty well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lately, however, he&amp;#39;s been messaging me more frequently. I guess it&amp;#39;s because I&amp;#39;m returning to visit London for two weeks next week. But he also told me that he broke up with the rebound. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know how to respond to this. When I go back to London, we kinda expect to see each other. I have to collect some things from his house (lol). And I guess we have loads of mutual friends so we&amp;#39;ll definitely be getting tipsy together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know guys. I&amp;#39;ve worked so hard to get out of depression and move on from how betrayed I felt because of him. But, tbh, him telling me he&amp;#39;s now single made me so happy. Of course it did. I still have feelings for him, heck I still love him. I&amp;#39;m an irrational stupid stupid boy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you think I should do when I get there? Stay away? I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s an option for I don&amp;#39;t have self-control. Do you think I should allow for something to happen? If it does, how do I prepare myself from not regressing to depression when I get back?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still love him. Loads. Before I left we talked about the possibility of being together in the distant-future. That hope is always going to be with me. I&amp;#39;m returning to London in 2 years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do I let it all go? Or just go with the flow? :) THANKS IN ADVANCE!&lt;/p&gt;

So today, I was just screwing around on Google, looking up random things when I decided to look up gay relationships, advice, and the like when I started to noticed a trend. Many of the articles were saying things like, ""Can Gay Men Really be Monogamous?"" or ""Most Gay Marriages are Open"" my first assumption was that these articles were written by websites who want to demonize same-sex relationships or keep marriage between a man and a woman. 

However, to my surprise, most of these articles were by websites like Advocate, or Out. Morally, I suppose you can say I'm ""old fashioned"" I love the idea of being truly faithful to one person, I see dating as getting to know someone, not sleeping with them, and I see love as something between two people; basically I love monogamy. (I wish to emphasize though, I have nothing against people who like one night stands, or prefer open relationships, if it works for you, more power to you!) 

I began to dig deeper, and realized most of these studies took their samples from big cities and very urban environments, where I'm pretty sure even a fair amount of opposite sex relationships are open and heterosexuals are just as into polyamory as gays, lesbians, and bisexuals. So, I kind of wanted to get a bigger picture and see how you guys feel about monogamy and what not. Is it important to you guys or some of the other gay/bisexual guys you've met? Also, if you are friends with same sex couples, how many of them are monogamous? ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys, &lt;/p&gt;

So, me and my boyfriend of seven years recently decided to open things up. We spent hours talking and agreed that this was something we wanted to do. It was not out of the blue, we've talked about it superficially for the last couple of years, and at first I was pretty excited. We're mid-twenties and have been together since high school.

Since the decision, however, my feelings have developed in the opposite direction from my mind. I was taken aback by how quickly and comfortably he started hooking up with other guys (six in two weeks, although I'm trying not to fixate on quantity). When he learned that I was having a hard time he started throwing up walls; his first reaction was basically to tell me that he didn't want to hear about it. The last weekend we spent together (we live about an hour apart), he would not put down Grindr long enough to process a sentence coming out of my mouth. A lot of little things are upsetting me and it's not always obvious which are justified and which are just me being immature. I don't know if I'm jealous, envious, or simply angry about his response to me not being OK... [I just have a lot of feelings.](http://media.tumblr.com/49927eca8ed9c61eab4471de25617787/tumblr_inline_mzmsizsIjQ1rlpk9c.gif)

A month ago I was jacking off to Craigslist postings, so I know I'm not just along for the ride, but right now the whole idea gives me a negative boner. I had someone over this week and could barely keep it up. I think I did it expecting some sense of equal footing to come out of it, and that it would get me over this lull. Wrong motivation.

Part of me still thinks that I just need some time to get my mojo back. This is what my boyfriend must be thinking, as he knows me well (I'm that guy who grumbles about going to the party, but then goes all out and makes it a great night once I get there), but I'm also worried that it might simply be that I'm not cut out for this after all.

Has anyone else gotten cold feet after opening up, and gotten past it?

He was just my type - bearded burly and creative, plus we had really good conversation (at least I thought so). This was the beginning of January. So here's where I get mixed signals.  

Our messages on Scruff after the date go like this:  
**Me:** I had a good time tonight. I'd love to hang again soon.  
**Him:** Great time. But I'm a top as well and I'm not into rough dominating stuff or bi really. But would like to be friends...  
**Me:** Ok cool. You're a cool dude. I'd like to be friends.  

Now this wasn't me being salty. I actually was interested in being friends with him as he was pretty cool. Even if that was a blow off I still figured I'd put it out there. Fast forward to the end of January where I've all but forgot about him (about 23 days later).  

**Him:** Dude! Where ya been? How ya been? I'm a little flaky on scruff. Let's hang out. (number) feel free to txt me.  

At this point I was like 'really? wtf' and I didn't respond. I don't think it was intentional per se with me not responding. I think I did one of those things where you read it, acknowledge it, intend to reply, and never do. Fast forward 2 weeks to yesterday.  

**Him:** Hey buddy. What's happening?  
**Me:** Not much. Working on clothing patterns. You?  
**Him:** Same old. Let's get a drink!?  
**Me:** Cool. Sounds good. How bout early next week.  
**Him:** That sounds good! I'm around. (number)  

I then texted him  

**Me:** Hey dude it's flux365. When and where do you wanna get a drink?  
**Him:** Hi flux365! How's it been? I like (place). Why do you think? {pretty sure he meant 'what'} Are you free Monday or Tuesday??  
**Me:** Monday is cool.  

He uses a lot of excessive punctuation now and seems pretty excited I think. So I need some honest feedback. I have no clue what to expect. Obviously I'll find out when I meet up with him for a drink, but I wanna know what you guys think because I really have no clue here. What changed? Maybe he likes my new profile pic?

&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; Ok cool. You&amp;#39;re a cool dude. I&amp;#39;d like to be friends.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now this wasn&amp;#39;t me being salty. I actually was interested in being friends with him as he was pretty cool. Even if that was a blow off I still figured I&amp;#39;d put it out there. Fast forward to the end of January where I&amp;#39;ve all but forgot about him (about 23 days later).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Him:&lt;/strong&gt; Dude! Where ya been? How ya been? I&amp;#39;m a little flaky on scruff. Let&amp;#39;s hang out. (number) feel free to txt me.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I was like &amp;#39;really? wtf&amp;#39; and I didn&amp;#39;t respond. I don&amp;#39;t think it was intentional per se with me not responding. I think I did one of those things where you read it, acknowledge it, intend to reply, and never do. Fast forward 2 weeks to yesterday.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Him:&lt;/strong&gt; Hey buddy. What&amp;#39;s happening?&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; Not much. Working on clothing patterns. You?&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Him:&lt;/strong&gt; Same old. Let&amp;#39;s get a drink!?&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; Cool. Sounds good. How bout early next week.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Him:&lt;/strong&gt; That sounds good! I&amp;#39;m around. (number)  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then texted him  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; Hey dude it&amp;#39;s flux365. When and where do you wanna get a drink?&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Him:&lt;/strong&gt; Hi flux365! How&amp;#39;s it been? I like (place). Why do you think? {pretty sure he meant &amp;#39;what&amp;#39;} Are you free Monday or Tuesday??&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; Monday is cool.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He uses a lot of excessive punctuation now and seems pretty excited I think. So I need some honest feedback. I have no clue what to expect. Obviously I&amp;#39;ll find out when I meet up with him for a drink, but I wanna know what you guys think because I really have no clue here. What changed? Maybe he likes my new profile pic? Did I even change it since I last spoke with him early January? I don&amp;#39;t know. I&amp;#39;m lost.  &lt;/p&gt;

This is a throwaway since most of my friends know my real account, So im a 17 year old closeted gay guy with only a friend that knows, i am 100% sure i'm gay, but everytime im in a sexual situation i just move away and blow off the person, for example ive had this bestfriend ( straight , i guess?) that ive always been attractided to but never initiated anything or ever told him anything. Like i can control myself.
But since 3 months ago this guy has been trying to do things all the time when were together. Like once he tried kissing me when we were alone i told him wtf man and just moved away although when hes not there i always think about it and want to do it so bad , but everytime im with him and he intiates anything i get creeped out and tell him to go away ALTHOUGH IM EXTREMELY ATTRACTED TO THIS GUY AND WANT HIM SO BAD!
So i thought it would be a problem from the guy and went on and downloaded grindr to try and get my first sexual experience ever and chatted with a reallllly attractive guy ( i know i shouldnt be using grindr but im almost 18) the guy was 2 years older than me and we talked for a long time and i told him that im in the closet and 
Im not ready to come out at all , so i went to his house and he was really attractive and i seriously wanted to do something with this guy we watched a movie and chatted but when he went for a kiss i just moved away and was so scared , he went back and we chatted again then he went for another try i declined and told him i have to leave and just left.

I feel blessed to live in an era where guys are open and okay with their sexualities... but what about those who take it too close to the line?

I'm fine with the typical straightbro attitudes because it's always just 'play' in a way. I can tell that they don't mean it in a serious way. But now for the second time a guy has come into my life that doesn't act like this is play. He, just like the last guy, treats me totally differently from other guys. We're unusually intimate - hugging all the time, hanging out almost every day. Long eye contact when we hang out, he walks me to the subway station that's a mere 15 seconds away. Where other friends get candy for christmas he buys me shoes, I buy him a watch. We talk on the phone for hours, snapchat daily, SMSes have winks everywhere. Every goodbye ends in a hug, but feels really awkward as if we're both expecting something to happen - every time feels like the set-up for a movie-style kiss scene. Just minus the kiss.

Everyone thinks we're a couple, and the problem is that it seriously feels like it. It feels too real. That mental block with other guys doesn't exist - it 110% seems like he's sending signals. It's not just a friendship, but it's not full-blown relationship. Everyone can see it, except him.

I love him as a friend, the same with the last guy. If they wanted to go for it, I wouldn't hold back. But I don't want to push/force anything since I don't want to ruin a what is otherwise perfectly good friendship.

Just like with the last guy, I finally summed up the courage to talk with the new one about it. ""I'm flattered,"" they both admitted. But they're just ""extremely comfortable."" That's the *only* explanation for the behaviour. Nothing more.

Bullshit I say.

I'm a good judge of character. But this is the second time it's happening. Like they say, if everyone around you is an arse, it's probably you - so I'm beginning to think that the fault lies with me. I made it perfectly clear to both that I'm gay, and both of them ticked every box except for the ""straight"" box. Yet they say that they're *""just comfortable.""*

This drives me insane because I'm the kind of guy that doesn't have more than one love interest at a time. How can I 'just move on' if this continues to happen? Why is it that these ""comfortable"" straight dudes can't make up their minds? Or am I at fault somehow?

One of my friends from college recently asked me to be one of groomsmen.  I've known the guy for 12 years, lived with him for a few years post-college; he's a very good friend.  I was really excited about it.

Today I talked with him, and he said that they have to ask one of the bride's family members to be in the groom-side bridal party.  He told me that I wasn't going to be in the wedding anymore; he didn't want to remove one of the other groomsmen because he thought it would hurt the guy's feelings.  This guy has been one of my most consistent friends for a long time.

I didn't care at first, but now I'm super bummed out about it.  I was really stoked on today being Friday, now I'm depressed and contemplating skipping the wedding (I wouldn't but you get the idea).

It's a destination wedding, I'm flying to the Caribbean for it.  When the bridal party is off doing photos, etc, I'm going to be sitting there resenting the fact that I'm not part of the wedding anymore.  It's pretty fucked up.  Is there anything I can/should do about this?  Wait a few days and see if my emotions change?  Talk to my buddy and let him know how I feel?  We don't live in the same city right now, so it's not like I'll be seeing him much face-to-face, but the wedding isn't until October.

Thanks bros, need e-shoulder to cry on at the moment, feeling down.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#39;t gay-related but I could use some advice and don&amp;#39;t really know where else to ask.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my friends from college recently asked me to be one of groomsmen.  I&amp;#39;ve known the guy for 12 years, lived with him for a few years post-college; he&amp;#39;s a very good friend.  I was really excited about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I talked with him, and he said that they have to ask one of the bride&amp;#39;s family members to be in the groom-side bridal party.  He told me that I wasn&amp;#39;t going to be in the wedding anymore; he didn&amp;#39;t want to remove one of the other groomsmen because he thought it would hurt the guy&amp;#39;s feelings.  This guy has been one of my most consistent friends for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t care at first, but now I&amp;#39;m super bummed out about it.  I was really stoked on today being Friday, now I&amp;#39;m depressed and contemplating skipping the wedding (I wouldn&amp;#39;t but you get the idea).&lt;/p&gt;

This girl in my lab who I will refer to as Janice is a very devout Christian. She's not a normal Christian, she's one of the more ""extreme"" Christians. She believes that a woman is below a man and she's doing her PhD only so her future husband will think she's worth something. Instead of being a stay at home mom with no education she wants to be a stay at home mom with a PhD. 

Anyway, my fiance is in another lab but we're all in the same lab area. She's been friendly with both of us but she told a fellow lab-mate that he's going to hell because of his lifestyle. He's gay but his lifestyle is no different than anyone else. He's pretty feminine but he could've been metrosexual. Anyway, Janice loves me to bits because I'm a nice guy but I don't really care for her. She recently referred to me as her ""best friend"" and it made me feel guilty.

Around Christmas she found out that my fiance was my fiance instead of just a friend that she assumed. She still speaks to my fiance normally as well but she hasn't been showing up to the lab that often. 

Now my question..

My supervisor has been working hard with my data to put out a paper. This is a pretty big deal and she's going to be submitting it to a few major journals and she's confident they'll accept it. Janice doesn't work hard at all. She hardly shows up and when she passed candidacy everyone was surprised. This is her 4th year of her PhD and she only just started a project. She wasted time in the last 3 years finishing her masters stuff (A whole masters degree takes 2-3 years.. I finished mine in 2) and I know my supervisor pulled some strings to get her to pass. Anyway, after hearing about the journal business, Janice has been asking to help me with certain things or she wants to give me sections of embryos that we're working on. She's never done this before, ever. My fiance and I were talking about it and we've come to the conclusion that she's doing this to be third author on the paper. 

I don't know if I should keep declining her or if I should just cave and let her be on the paper. She's treated me the same since finding out I was gay but I'm not sure if I should let her take advantage of me. What she's offering doesn't really contribute anything I can't do myself. I just don't want her to get upset about it, she can easily mess with my stuff if she really wanted to.

Yesterday my bf and I were out for a walk and ran into one of my coworkers and his wife.

Then today my coworker asked about the guy I was with yesterday (bf) and again I came up with some story. I felt terrible about lying to him and hiding my bf. My bf says he's ok, but I know it hurts him. As much as it hurts him, it kills me. I feel like I'm breaking the trust of my coworkers too. 

TL;DR I'm closeted and having to lie about my bf. And it's killing me.

I've been doing a lot of soul searching lately, in addition to going back to counseling after being out for two years. 

**BACKGROUND**

I'm in college, I have social anxiety, ADD, and think I am bisexual. I've had sex with both men and women, but have never dated or had a relationship. I am very intimidated by attractive women, and find it very hard to approach them in a social setting. I am more comfortable with men, but that's because I seek friendships, not sex. 

Some of the things I am working on is how to relate with other people and form relationships. We have been talking about my personality type, and are discovering I have quite a few narcissistic and sociopathic traits, including:

1. Desire to look/dress/act ""perfect"", and intolerance of failure (being awkward in public, getting a B on a test, etc.)

2. A ""better than you"" mentality. My parents have always commented on how I act so ""entitled"" and to ""get off my high horse"", counselor seems to agree.

3. Lack of empathy towards others, making situations about me, manipulating others to get what I want (favors, sex, etc.)

**CURRENT PROBLEM** 

I have high standards for physical attractiveness. I have been described as an ""easy 7 hard 8"", but the girls I tend to go for 9s and 10s. When they like me, it's all good. If they don't I am crushed and take it very poorly (I used to self harm). 

I eventually got very lonely and tried out grindr as a means to start some conversations. To my surprise, my inbox was constantly being filled with new messages. I am white, slim/fit, and hairless, and I had no idea there were so many guys who think ""twinks"" are hot. I always assumed guys wanted rugged, hairy, manly men. It was awesome feeling like the center of attention. I thought ""this must be what hot girls get to enjoy: having enough suitors that you can literally ignore/choose who you want and still have dozens more""

Anyway... it got the point where I would actually meet up and have sex with them. I would love the way they would touch my body and shower me with compliments. I had made rules with guys before meeting that I didn't want to cum when we meet up. We would just cuddle, maybe bang (I bottom), and I would leave without cumming. I admit that I had a lot of fun when we followed that rule, but every time a guy managed to persuade me to cum (or just jerked me off), I would feel a huge rush of guilt and shame.

**I feel like I'm so messed up mentally and emotionally because of this... but I can't stop using gay dating apps because even sleeping with random guys is better than an empty bed.**
