I already set up a time, place, &amp; premise (""gotta talk about something""), but I'm crazy nervous and need to calm my nerves.

Me: I'm 29 and not out. I started coming to terms with my sexuality 3 years ago, told my ex, tried making it work anyway but it didn't. I have no gay friends; I practically deleted them trying to find God and fix myself. I'm not dating and I don't want to anytime soon; I still feel broken.

Them: I've known and been close to both for years. We roomed together in college, we partied together after college, we game whenever we can, support each others relationships, met each others families, and have a lot of history. We each have different backgrounds; one is Catholic, the other Christian (non-denom) but we all lead pretty secular lives.

They've already noticed I've been distant and distracted over the past year, but I've been very vague about why that was. They know my recent breakup with my 6 year girlfriend affected me deeply, but they have no clue it's because I'm gay. We don't have too many gay friends and the ones we have are not in our regular circle.

I'm still scared to tell them. I'm scared of creating distance between us and asking them to lie (I'm not out to family). I'm afraid they won't understand. I'm not really comfortable yet with our circle of friends knowing, but we hang out together practically weekly. I'm not even sure how to be ""out""... I'm literately stumbling through this.

But I'm tired of hiding and having nobody to talk to. I want to lay out everything to them - why we broke up, why we got back together, the sudden ""religion"", the therapy sessions, the reparative therapy, why I've been distant, the nights up crying, missed work, depression and suicidal thoughts. I want to be honest with them, completely.

But what if they ask if I ever had a crush on them? I actually fell hard for my best friend in college (I'm over him, but that's crazy embarrassing). What if they ask if I have a crush now? I've never been open with sex with them (it's obvious why) but I feel compelled to share this.

What if they tell my ex they know? What if she asks if they know? I promised to be honest with her, to thwart that ""lying homosexual"" stereotype she clings to, but she's so evangelical fundamentalist that every gay topic that comes up ends in straight condemnation. She's still close with my (evangelical) family, and I'm far from ready to let them know or have her expose me to ""save my soul"".

&lt;p&gt;This is distressing because I don&amp;#39;t know what to do. I would really like to be with this guy regardless, but I&amp;#39;m just not sure how the sex is going to happen. Any tips? Similar stories?&lt;/p&gt;

I can't express how much I appreciate it. I'm just posting this here because you guys seem to be great at responding to this stuff. Anyway, I'll just skip right to the point.

Sort of recently, I feel like I've been gradually fucking up my life. As silly as that sounds because I'm only 18, it's just the fact that I haven't graduated high school, got my driver's license, have no job and literally game all day. It's really gotten me down.

Only I can fix this, but my motivation is literally at an all-time low. I can't get myself to do anything. I'm medicated for depression and it's actually been a huge help, but I still struggle enormously with motivation. It took me a few weeks (maybe more) to finally get myself to write this post. I often wonder if I'm just lazy as hell, which I hope isn't the case... but who knows.


I have 2 credits (courses) left at my school, and I'll be graduated when I get them (graduating roughly half a year later). It's ridiculous to me that I can't even get myself to go to the school and just finish the courses. Why is this?


On top of this, I have an insane crush on a good (straight) friend of mine, but it'll never be and I shouldn't even be dwelling on it... But damn, it sucks. This has been a huge bother to me lately because I talk to him on a daily basis. I know this doesn't really relate to motivation, but I felt like I needed to throw it in because I'm sad as fuck about it.


In all of this, how should I get off of my ass and tell myself to do stuff? People have given me straight forward answers such as ""just fucking do it"", and although I know they're right, it doesn't affect how I deal with it at all. There's a recommended subreddit called ""GetMotivated"", which I may check out. What do you guys think I should do though? I'm sick of feeling sad as fuck and like a failure.


Once again, thank you so much. I'm usually not this expressive about the situation, but I'm in one of those ""deep sad"" moments right now. I probably just need to chill out (while not being lazy lol).

We weren't texting daily but we had pretty good conversations. 

However Saturday, I was bored ;-)... so I started messaging him. He basically told me he finished errands. I said today is a nice day to cuddle with someone and I wouldn't mind it with you.

He basically said his laundry can wait and asked what I wanted to do. I said watch a movie, cuddle and drink hot chocolate. 

He thought it was cute but he didnt have the hot coco. I finally got to his house very pleased to see he is way sexier in person. What I found cute was that he went out to the store to buy a box of hot chocolate. We watched 30 mins of the movie while cuddling than we kissed and started messing around for 3 hrs.

We didnt have sex... first because I didn't want it than I couldn't handle it because apparently he had a huge penis and I haven't had sex in a year.

Anyways that was the back story probably unnecessary but maybe can help. 

I haven't texted him since that day saying I had a really nice time and he responded me too saying thank you for coming it was fun.

Do you think I messed up by getting to know him more on a serious level since I messed with him? If I didnt should I text him and what should I write? We exchanged numbers ao when I get to his house I can call him.

At the weekend, my partner and I went out with our fellow homos and we all had a grand time. To cut to the chase, at one point, one of them decided to dump a bottle of glitter on my head as a joke. Usually, I would be very cross coz I am well aware that it is a pain in the arse to clean up glitter and it always takes ages to get rid of it, but I was too drunk to be bothered about it really, and just carried on being extra glam that night.

But then the morning after, I woke up in bed to realise it was covered in glitter - the sheets, the duvet cover, the pillows, everything. In the bathroom, I saw that I was basically a bloody sparkling vampire with a reflection.

Gave myself a thorough washing in the shower... plenty remained after washing.

Tried to brush it off... didn't work.

Tried rubbing it off with a damp towel... better, but still some left! Especially around the eyes.

I used shampoo and conditioner a few times but I can still find glitter in my hair and I keep finding specks of glitter in my beard. It's those microscopic bits that you can't see until the light hits it in the right way and are difficult to pick off with your fingers. Boyfriend rubbed olive oil on my body and that led to other events but alas was still ineffective. Now he's suggested spreading peanut butter on me and at this point I think he's having too much fun with this! This stuff is everywhere! Who knows what we were up to that night when we got home because the whole place is contaminated with glitter, even the cat! 

In the end, this isn't a big deal at all but do any of you have tips on how I can get this stuff off of my body and out of my home please? I'm going to vacuum every last damned centimetre of this house. Glitter can die!

I'm 20, from Ireland and go to college in the nearest city an hour away from my town where I'm still living. It's a homophobic environment, my (former) best friends joked about putting all the gays in the world on an island and killing them, part of the reason why I burned all bridges with them. One of my uncles called Simon Cowell ""a gay bastard"" in front of my gay uncle (who's camp, doesn't relate to me and would probably throw me under a bus if I was out just to get pressure off of himself.) My mother knows about my sexuality, but is friends with a guy who said he'd be ""disappointed"" if he had a son who turned out gay.

My college isn't much better, while there are a few openly gay people around the place they're really camp and I don't relate or feel drawn to them at all. My friends think I'm straight and are convinced that all gay people have a homogenous personality and appearance. I'd prove them wrong by being out there, except for the fact that one of the girls in there is also from my town and has gossiped on social media about my interview day, which I didn't want anyone from my town knowing about. This means she'd almost certainly blab about my sexuality if she found out. There are two other people from my town in the college as well, which makes it even more likely for stuff to filter back. My best friend there seems to wish I was gay, but
loves to get drunk - once she drank so much she couldn't remember anything. Since drink makes people talk and she seems to be close friends with the blabbermouth, I can't trust her. This leaves me with about one or two other people who seem trustworthy but I don't know nearly as well to tell them this.

So the crux of the problem I have is that I am in a place where my sexuality shouldn't be a problem but because of a rotten apple I'm stuck in a capsule where I have to lie constantly and watch everyone else develop while I'm stranded with nobody to talk to. I find the average young straight couple really hard to stomach, it makes me ask questions like ""Why me? Why am I not allowed to experience that?"" It's just be getting worse over the past few weeks and seriously disrupting my work, I've also been thinking about suicide a lot (though I never seem to get *actually* suicidal.) I'm aiming to emigrate in about 4-5 years when I finish college and have become a workaholic, but the idea of waiting seems like it'll drive me over the edge.
 
I could contact my college's LGBT society but they're based on the main campus which is miles away and I'm afraid they'll out me somehow, or I'll be recognised by someone. Moving out isn't an option because the government here is so greedy and obsessed with fucking everyone over for their money through austerity that they seem to think we shouldn't even have a disposable income, which is why I've had to focus on going directly to emigration.
 
I've been holding off on posting this for a while because there are people in far worse situations than me and I'm only 20, but today I couldn't think straight, considered coming out to a friend about five times, nearly had a nervous breakdown or something at not being able to tell anyone and ended up leaving early. Thinking about suicide a lot also made me realise I should probably say something somewhere before it gets out of hand. I'm not really sure what to do.

So he basically came earlier to see me than he said he would
We were in my room and we sat down on my bed and he just blurted out ""I've broken up with Ellen (his girlfriend)"", I was really shocked, I thought they honestly had something special, so I basically asked ""why?"" and he just said ""I found someone better"". I guess what he said turned me paranoid, because I wanted to know who he liked and maybe I won't get a shot at it., so we just talked ,played games and well he went home

He did call me although about two hours after he left and told me ""I love you, like I really love you"", I replied with ""I love you too"". After that phone call, I guess I've been wondering why he left his girlfriend and I hope they are still friends though

Thanks for reading my personal problem and I don't know why he said ""I love you"" like that

I'm also an introvert, so going out just to meet people sounds draining to me.
