After having never experienced anything with either sex after denying myself for years I was finally excited to get out there and start dating or whatever.

The problem is I can't seem to find anyone interested in me. I use both Tinder and Grindr. I get heaps of matches on Tinder and regular comments/compliments on Grindr. I always take note of what people are looking for when they approach me and I always try to start up a convo with the guys who are marked 'chats/friends/dates' in hopes I'll find someone like me, or someone that might like me. 

Despite the flattering attention it seems no one has interest in talking to me past hello. Like, literally all I get is hellos before people drop off. I literally don't understand. 

Am I doing something wrong? I can't seem to get anyone to want to talk to me despite having good responses from my pictures (god that sounds so douchey but I don't know how else to phrase it), it's just getting me really downhearted. 

I'm thinking it has to do with my height. I'm about 164cm, pretty fit/toned. I only show my face. I get nice comments about it, but maybe they realise I'm short and decide I'm not worth the time.

I don't know, it just kinda sucks that now I'm finally out and ready to be happy I can't seem to connect with anyone. It just sucks reading all these stories about people being happy and finding people and me being in a city of 1.2mill can't find a single anybody.

I got one or two tiny genital warts a few years ago, and by this time had assumed it was gone since I haven't noticed anything for over a year. 

I was chatting with a guy from tinder and we both seem interested, in fact he seems great. I have in fact never been with a guy before but it's something I'd like to try, and I'd got quite excited about this.

Then disaster as I noticed another tiny little wart, and I went from dreamily looking forward to something life changing and exciting, to hating myself and wanting to disappear. I've almost made up my mind to cancel, and resign myself back to single life. 

It doesn't seem fair but then that's probably what whoever gave it to me thought. 

Can someone slap me in the face with reality but be gentle about it, feeling pretty vulnerable about this. On the one hand I think it's not so big a deal, 80% of people get it at some point, on the other hand I would be livid if someone knew and didn't tell me, and on the third hand if I didn't mention it, got found out and murdered. If we knew each other better I'd be tempted to say but as we don't even really know each other at this point I may as well not mention it and break off contact and save myself the pain/humiliation.

The other angle of this is that I'm a bottom and don't really have any desire to be touched there anyway..

I hang out a lot with him: we play sports once a week at this place, we watch movies, grab dinner, etc.

We both think the other is straight, until tonight, when during a conversation with a third friend, I tell him (the first friend) I'm gay.

He gets kind of surprised and reveals he's gay too, and asks me what I think of him.

During the conversation tonight, I was a little thick-headed and didn't understand what he was getting at. I thought he thought that I liked him. 

I thought about it a little more tonight. I think I created a misunderstanding because I'm not really into him - I'm just kind of bored and lonely and want some company. 

But as true as that is, I feel guilty saying that, kind of like ""I was lonely and all I knew was you so I asked you to hang out"". I think I would feel less guilty saying this to a straight friend, but I think he might like me? I'm not sure, I want to ask him but like, I feel like I need to explain this first. And saying this to him if he likes me is kind of rude and crushing.

I'm not sure if this should be (over)interpreted, but he took his time to say that he was gay, and he appeared confused, surprised (that I was gay) but mostly just really flustered. I'm not sure why. Like he looked pretty  frustrated / shocked for a while (the entire duration of our talk) and it made me a little scared and worried me for hours that I might have said something wrong.

I feel like I've always been a little unsure about whether I'll be good enough and I've used that feeling as fuel to keep working on becoming a better person, but recently it doesn't seem to be enough.

This really started about three weeks ago when, after a prolonged dry spell in the bedroom, my anxiety got the best of me.  After we rolled apart following another rejection of my sexual advances, I asked the darkness ""Do you like having sex?""  He remained silent for a moment.

""Yes.  Sometimes.""

""Do you... Do you find me sexually attractive?""  Another pause.

""Sometimes.""  It was a damning confirmation of something I had long suspected - and joked about on occasion - that I wasn't his type, not really.  Before I'd blamed it on his being tired, or his low libido, or on our ""cycles"" not lining up but then he confirmed it: I'm not the blonde-haired, blue-eyed built man he'd envisioned being with when he was a teenager.

Over the past few weeks I've tried to tell myself that we can work past it, that he's still tired or stressed or too preoccupied with school and work to relax and think about sex but it's been three weeks and we still haven't had sex - not for my lack of trying either.  I've made advances in different ways: seductive hints, light caresses, direct requests - I even stripped him naked on the bed two nights ago but I could tell he wasn't into it and when I asked him, he said he'd rather go play video games.

All the while I feel like I'm starting to pull away more and more and we're really not communicating.  Tonight while we were walking down town he was trying to hold my hand, which I can't stand when we're out in certain neighbourhoods.  I came out in seventh grade and have spent most of my life as the token gay guy in my schools.  I've been singled out and picked on a lot which didn't really help with my already shy and introverted nature.  Holding hands in public makes me anxious because I feel like I'm being stared at and it invites the potential for attention that I don't want.

So tonight when we passed two other guys and I slipped my fingers out from those of my partner's, he questioned me on it - despite the fact that one of the guys passing by had already mumbled ""faggot"" under his breath.  Knowing that my partner doesn't usually pick up on this kind of thing, I simply told him that holding hands made me uncomfortable and he kind of groaned unhappily.  We didn't speak for the remaining 20 minute train ride home.

I'm sorry for the scattered thoughts but it's getting late here and my brain is sort of running through these moments like a montage of images and sound.  Writing them out has been helpful, though I'm not really sure what I hope to accomplish by sharing them in this forum.  I feel like I've tried everything here:  I've made my position and insecurities known, I've asked him repeatedly what I can do to be a better partner for him, and I've only gotten stonewalled at every turn.  I read a blog entry recently to the effect of ""if you tell someone their inferior enough times, eventually they start to believe you,"" and even though he hasn't actually said I'm not good enough, I'm really getting the feeling that I'm not the one he's happy to have chosen even though he accepted my proposal two years ago and has happily worn the ring ever since.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been with my partner for 8 years now and while we seem to make each other happy, I&amp;#39;ve become increasingly concerned that I can&amp;#39;t live up to being the person he needs.

Using a throwaway because people know my main.

Basically, I replied to someone's ad on Craigslist. (Now I know that there are mixed views of this site, but that isn't the cause for this post.) He said he was late 20's, divorced, couldn't host, and just looking for someone inexperienced to try things out with. Not too weird, right?

So we get to emailing, and he asks if I could reply to another email address of his. I see no problem with this, as I'm using a dummy email too. 

Even so, I did want to check this guy out, to see if anything sketchy was going on, so I Googled his name and since it was fairly generic, I didn't get any good results. 

But then I noticed how on the sidebar (I'm using Gmail) that there was an unfamiliar name there. I checked to see what recent mail I had received from this person, and as it turns out, this was (what I believe to be) the real name of the guy I've been chatting with. The email was linked to his Google+, I'm guessing.

So anyways, I gather some basic info from his Google+ and go to Facebook and see what I can find. I find only a handful of guys with the name, but there was one that matched many things from the Google+ account. Name, work, friends/contacts, etc.

Here's where the problem comes in: he's married. To a woman. And has children.

When I saw these things, I immediately knew something was wrong. Not too sure about his actual age, not that that was much of a concern, but he's definitely not divorced. Literally 21 hours ago he updated his profile picture of him, his wife and kids saying ""My happy family"" etc etc.

So anyways, I should probably get to my question. What should I say? I'm not going to ruin someone else's life, not that kind of person. But at the same time, we haven't exchanged face pics or anything so I can't confirm this.

I'm genuinely worried and don't know what to do. I'm definitely not meeting up with him if all of this is true.

During this time he's hooked up with my female friend[who I've known for almost ten years] a couple times, and it would make me jealous of course, but nothing I couldn't handle. 

Well, she and another female friend ended up moving into the house with us[I live in the garage apartment]. It was pretty much decided that they weren't going to hook up while living together, as to avoid unnecessary drama. Before the girls moved in, however, I ended up blowing him during our extra-final porn session.

It's been almost two months now and I found out yesterday that they started dating two weeks into the new lease. During this time she and I had gone out for drinks, and she patronizingly confronted me about my feelings for him. I was very uncomfortable, because I already felt like they were going to start dating soon. But when I asked her about them dating, she said 'that would never happen'. And I asked her not to date him while we all lived together. Little did I know, they were already dating at that time. 

For the past two months, I've driven myself crazy trying to figure out why there was so much tension between us. I figured it was all in my head, this crazy paranoid jealousy that they're hooking up behind my back. I had had a few conversations with him about this tension, that I've been feeling like they're excluding me and I can't figure out why. He would give me some lame excuse, like, ""Well, she feels the same way, I've done all the compromising that I can."" Being a reasonable person, I figured that this is all in my head, that the only reason I'm feeling possessive is because him and I used to do **everything** together, and now he finally has a tv downstairs and he can watch stuff without having to hang out with me.

Two nights ago kind of broke the camels back. There was yet another night of me trying to hang out with them, and being given some weird kind of run around, and me getting upset because I couldn't figure out why I felt like they were excluding me. *Are they just forgetting about me? But no, I'm texting them trying to see what they're up to. Are they purposefully hanging out without me? But why? They must be dating- No, stop it randoguy14, that's just your paranoid jealousy spiking up, they would tell you if something like that was going on.*

So the next day at lunch I brought it up with him, same old conversation about me feeling like they're excluding me. He got upset, gave me some more runaround about how he's doing all that he can to compromise here, and feels trapped in the middle because we both get jealous when he hangs out with the other. I ended the conversation with: ""Well, can you just promise me, as my friend, that when you guys start dating you'll be upfront with me about it?""    
And he said, ""Well, I can't promise that because if she wants to keep it from you because she's worried about your reaction, then I probably won't say anything.""

Everything clicked at that point. I pretty much just yelled at them last night; for making me feel like a crazy jealous insecure asshole, for knowing what the source of all of this tension is and not just clearing it up. I yelled at her for confronting me about my feelings for him that night at the bar, and I still have more questions for her as to why she even did that. I told him about how all of this shit has been making me seriously doubt our best friendship the past weeks, because I've felt like the only reason he was spending all that goddamn time with me is because I had a tv and an xbox, and could entertain him. 

Don't worry though, I'm trying to be mature about this. I saw this coming a year ago, I sub-consciously knew that this is where it was going to end. I just never thought that they would purposefully remove my autonomy in this situation. All day today I've just been sifting over the past weeks, and becoming pissed off again when I think about all the times the three of us would hang out, and I'd feel like such an asshole and an idiot for wondering why there was all this tension. About how I was an unwitting participant in him having lunch with her mom for the first time, or a brunch where her friends and his friends were all together for the first time. 

I recognize that she was scared, afraid to tell me, especially after our initial conversation at the bar. And I get that he's in a relationship with her, and while he knew very well that keeping it a secret like this would only make things worse, he's gonna do what she wants, because its what she wants. I just can't help but feel that he's betrayed me. That this is a clear indicator that, even though I'm supposedly his best friend, that he'll purposefully keep me in pain and confusion, if that's what she wants. 

Again, I'm trying to be mature. I figure that I get a week to be bitchy and passive-aggressive about this, before I need to begin making amends with myself. Because I get to decide how I rebound from this, and what I take away from this. My friendship with them will never be the same, and I really want to never look at either of them again. That's very immature, but I plan on finding a new normal with them. And while I've been fairly melodramatic about this whole event, I still can't help but feel like this is a betrayal.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if you look at my other two posts, I&amp;#39;ve talked about how me and my straight best friend[and housemate] would watch porn and jack off together for about eight months.

First off, thank you for all the advice.  So it turns out you were all right and he is in love with me.  It's all got really fucking complicated really quickly and I don't know what to do now.  I went out for a walk this morning to clear my head and have just spent the day walking around.  He's gone out with a friend now so I haven't seen him since the morning.

I think this is going to be another small novel so thanks again if you make it all the way through.

So last night I got back to his place armed with a couple of bottles of wine and a bagful of snacks and found him in the kitchen preparing dinner.  He was behind the counter so I couldn't see but I knew he was fully naked.  I hadn't planned on addressing it so soon after walking in the door to be honest because normal he strips off after some sort of excuse rather than just being there all out.  So we did some small talk about our day a bit until I found the courage to say ""so you're naked again then?""  He just said that it was really hot today and thought there was a storm brewing (he was right and there was a massive storm later).  I just kept quiet because I didn't really know what to say next so there was just this massive awkward silence.  Then he said ""you're cool with it aren't you?"".  So I just went on this sort of mad rambling speech saying how I thought it was cool he was so comfortable with me and he could do what wants in his own home and that he should be confident with his body and blah blah blah.  I totally flubbed it and just went round the same things over and over trying to remember the advice from my last post.  When I ran out of steam and just trailed off he said ""what are you trying to say? Because you're saying that it's fine but it doesn't sound like that's what you mean.  Do you want me to put clothes on?""  I said yes and he went off to his room.

But he didn't come back so eventually I called out to him.  He didn't answer so I called out again and asked him to come and talk to me.  When he came out (dressed) I was sure that he'd been crying.  I got a bottle of wine and glasses and we sat on the sofa.  I have never felt so awkward.  He started apologising and saying that he didn't know it made me uncomfortable and didn't know what he was doing and I could see that he was welling up again.  I tried to reassure him that it was fine and I didn't wasn't angry or anything.  I told him I was worried about him because he seemed so sad at the moment and he said he was having a hard time with things at the moment but couldn't tell me what it was.  Honestly it was fucking agonising because we both knew what was coming but were both too scared to say it.

After ages of this circular talk he started crying until he had to stop talking.  I moved over to him and put my arm around him to try and console him and asked him what it was that got him so upset.  He just kept crying and shaking his head and I knew what it was anyway so eventually I said ""do you like me?"" and he just sort of tried to brush it of with with an ""of course I like you"".  He tried to suck it up and be all normal again so I had to pull him round to face me and lift his head to look into his eyes and ask him again.  The look in his eyes nearly fucking broke me.  He managed to say ""yes always"" before he totally broke down.  I didn't have anything to say so I just pulled him and held him.  I didn't know what else to do so I just hugged him and told him it was OK.  I have to admit that I was fighting back the tears too because it was all so much.  It was fucking awful.  We stayed like that for I don't know how long before he pulled away and we composed ourselves.  So then it all came out.  He said he'd fancied me from when we first met on our course and that he hadn't known what to do about it because he knew I was straight.  He said that sometimes I confused him by being a camp when I got drunk so for a while he thought I might be bi.  He'd tried to ignore his feelings but they just grew and he thought maybe with time I would come round.

I asked him if that was why he kept getting naked and he said that was partly it and he was hoping that if he made it all normal then I might join in with him but he also said that he thought he might just like being naked anyway.  He talked about CMNM (and I surprised him by knowing what it was) and exhibitionism but he said I was the only friend that he did this with and that was another reason he liked me because I didn't seem to mind it.  I told him I didn't really mind being with him when he was naked but I was getting worried that it might be because he fancied me. 

Oh man.  I've written so much now and going through it again is really helpful but it's also really hard.  I'm going to try and be brief about the rest of the night so I can just post this before he comes home.

So we talked for hours and he told me all sorts of things I hadn't heard before about him struggling with his sexuality including a really dark period of his childhood that I won't go into here.  But it broke my heart to hear it.  I shared a lot with him too and it was so good to be so open.  By about 2 in the morning were were just drained from everything that had happened the when suddenly the thunderstorm hit.  He's got a flat quite high up that has an amazing view across London and the storm was epic.  We went and stood out on the balcony and watched the show.  I saw him shiver so I put my arm around his shoulder and he pulled in and put his arm around my waist.  We had this moment and then I went and shattered it by doing by best Andie MacDowell impression and said ""Is is it still raining?  I hadn't noticed!"".  It was about the first time we'd laughed all night and it was such a relief.  We laughed really hard and he told me what a dick I was.  I don't know what happened but the next thing I knew I was looking straight into his eyes and just leant in.  I think we were both shocked because we both pulled away really quickly.  And then we looked at each other and went for it again.  I'm still in shock about it but I'd being lying if I said I didn't enjoy it a bit.  It was only when I felt his dick starting to get hard that I had to pull away.  We both apologised immediately.  I don't know why I did it.  I felt so close to him after everything that happened I suppose and the moment was so genuinely romantic with the storm and all that it just sort of happened.  Then it was my turn to cry because I felt so strongly for him as a friend but didn't mean to lead him on.  He tried to hug me bit I wouldn't let him.  I said I'd had too much to drink and couldn't deal with it and went inside.  He told me it was OK and to try not to think about it too much and I should get some sleep because it's been an emotional day.

So that's basically it.  I lay on the sofabed going over and over it in my head until I fell asleep.  He woke me this morning with coffee and asked how I was doing.  I said I didn't know and needed to go out and get some air.  And that's what I've been doing all day because I don't know how to face him.  Sorry it's been so long again.  I feel like I've fucked up royally with this.  I'm sweating now just thinking about what to say when he comes back later.  I don't know how I feel anymore or what this means.  Any advice is much appreciated.

Update:  He's texted me asking if I'm there and that he's coming back and wants to talk.  So I'll be signing off for now and will update when I can.  We have some major talking to do I think.  Thanks so much for all the support and advice.  You guys are awesome.
