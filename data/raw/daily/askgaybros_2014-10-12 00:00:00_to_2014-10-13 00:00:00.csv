Husband of 17 years took to scruff and grindr (and Whatsapp etc) for a few months, chatting with many, many men and sending and receiving dick picks. Much of the chatting started out platonic and connection seeking and became explicit. He met a few for ""coffee"" and it seems there was one gay-physical encounter that I know of. I told him I knew about the cheating and lying and the betrayal. I asked him if he was gay and if he would like to pursue his sexuality. I told him if that were the case, we could divorce quietly and amicably and share the kids. But that I would not be lied to and cheated on. After a number of these conversations, swearing he was no no not gay, then relapsing into the chats and buying secret phones, I gave him an ultimatum. He again swore that he wasn't gay, he wanted our family, and that he only liked the attention and the camaraderie. Since then, he has not had any contact with random strangers or with the handful of guys he says he considered platonic friends (but who'd seen pics of his dick.......). He never confessed, I found out everything on my own. He won't talk about the gay physical encounter, saying it's regrettable. He won't openly admit that what he was doing was gay, saying he wants to not talk about it and put it behind him. This has never happened before, neither the lying nor the cheating nor the secret life. I've never had a gay vibe from him before. He is 52. So either he is gay and repressing it, or he's telling the truth and that it was a phase and that it's ""not me"".

This guy is the real deal. He's sweet, caring, goal-oriented, well-spoken, and attractive. I don't think I've felt this way about a guy before, and from what I can tell, the feelings are mutual.

So why the hangup? The main reason is that he is a smoker. I think he's cut down on them, but I find cigarette smoking disgusting and I don't know if I could deal with that if things got serious. None of my friends or acquaintances smoke either. It's been a deal breaker in the past for me.

So what should I do? I really like this guy, but I'm having a hard time getting over the smoking issue. Thoughts are appreciated!

&lt;p&gt;I can be a little dramatic at times, but I&amp;#39;m not into the gay scene and I like doing &amp;#39;manly&amp;#39; things, like watching sports (tbh I&amp;#39;m actually checking the guys out). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s so difficult for me to click with someone because there&amp;#39;s so many layers to me, and many don&amp;#39;t stick around to figure me all out (ah hope this doesn&amp;#39;t turn into a rant lol) and it makes me think I&amp;#39;ll never find a dominant guy who will be patient with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;has anyone ever felt this way and is what I am looking for making me come off as a selfish queen? lol&lt;/p&gt;

There's exactly one hiccup: I like receiving anal sometimes (being fucked and being rimmed and stuff), but he always seems ... almost like he's squicked out by the prospect of giving me any kind of anal pleasure. He says it's because he's a 'bottom'. I had heard the terms 'bottom' and 'top' before, but never really knew what they meant until I started dating him...he says he doesn't like it because he considers himself the woman...

In my relationships with women I've had them fuck me and it be fun for both of us, so I guess I'm just trying to understand where he's coming from. I love him, and I'd never make him do something he's uncomfortable with, but he can't seem to open up about it and so I thought maybe somebody else could shed some light.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Met this guy, hit it off with him like crazy, we&amp;#39;re totally in love.
