I'm currently in college and have really been hating my housing situation. Long story short, I moved into a 4 bedroom apartment a few months ago and was assigned random roommates.

I woke up with a hard on and had been fantasizing about fucking her and sucking cock. When we got back to my place and did the deed i really enjoyed it. Problem is - once i came i was completely repulsed by my partner. I know how bad this sounds and believe me i didn't show any of those feelings but the fact that there was an erect penis rubbing against my leg horrified me. I think when a guy comes there's usually a sense of: Meh, whatever, or a general (temporary) lack of interest in the person you were with but this was something completely different. I vowed not to do it ever again and wanted to leave the room. Thing is, i was aroused again later and had sex again. Even though i was still repulsed by her. In the morning i woke up and put my clothes on so that i could avoid having sex again. But my cock wanted her ass badly and i fucked her and came in minutes. 
I felt awful and guilty about the whole thing. Part of the guilt comes from the fact that i am in a relationship with a woman (soon to be ending i presume) but maybe i am also repulsed at the fact that i sucked a dick ? Can anyone here relate to this ? Does it go away after time ? I've no issues speaking about me sucking cock with a therapist or writing about it on reddit. I just can't understand why i'm so aroused by a transwoman with a cock and then once i've come i become repulsed by her. Am i really repulsed by myself and projecting it ?

I love him and want to see him happy and will do anything and everything to achieve that, but now I find myself not even wanting to lay next to him.

When we first got together we were opposites and I guess convinced myself that opposites attract, but our differences now seem as big as the grand Canyon where before they were faint cracks.

I try to accept him and I try to be understanding (I am agnostic)and the practice of any religion makes me uneasy especially his wiccan beliefs. He has set up an ""altar"" in our living room and I explain to him how uncomfortable it makes me and he tells me that I need to be understanding of his beliefs. He constantly talks to me about it trying to ""inform"" me but I have stopped listening. Maybe I'm not being understanding.

I'm sorry for this very long rant but I just feel so lost and I truly feel I have lost my deep love for him. How do I deal with this? How do I move on? I don't know if I can survive financially on my own. I'm afraid he won't survive financially on his own. 

I will add that at the beginning of our relationship he would constantly ask me if I loved him because he was afraid that I would eventually leave him which caused him to be very jealous. I put a stop to it after blowing up in his face, but I know it's still there. I can feel him constantly looking at my phone over my shoulder. Maybe this is his own self fulfilling prophecy. I don't know. Maybe it's me.

Has anyone fallen out of love? How did you deal with it?

&lt;p&gt;I know it has nothing to do with blood pressure because as soon as I leave their apartment I pop the biggest boner, it&amp;#39;s the strangest thing.&lt;/p&gt;

Bi guy here. My partner is a pre-T* transman. Originally met him when he was a very butch female. My partner came out as trans and is transitioning. I'm bi so I'm fine with it - still find him very attractive, our relationship is great, sex is even better.

But going to some of our old hang-outs  is sometimes a problem since my partner has started presenting as male. 

We'd like to go to some gay clubs. My partner passes fairly well (like many pre-T transmen, he looks like a teenage boy despite being in his 30's) but not 100%. Some people pick up he is physically female and still has to undergo physical transition (he's in the process of getting T and eventually wants to undergo complete physical reassignment - top and bottom surgery.)

**tldr**: Told my best friend/crush I don't want to live with him anymore. Need encouragement that it was the right choice.

I'm a long time lurker, occasional poster, and semi-frequent throwaway drunken poster... I understand how many ""straight best friend"" problems come through here, but please hear me out, I genuinely need some help here.

My ""Straight"" best friend isn't. He's bi, and we've had sex a few times. He's the first person I came out to, I come to him with my problems, he comes to me with his. I'm not the first guy he's been with, and he definitely enjoys it ;-). This is both awesome for me (cause I love the fuck out of him), and horrible for me (because he has a girlfriend and it's not sustainable). We drunken cuddle quite a lot, and he's often told me he loves me (Like ""I'll support you, I love you""). Probably the hottest moment of my life was when we were hosting a party at our place (we were all drunk), and he grabbed my ass, kissed me, and said ""Lets have sex tonight"". We were in the fucking kitchen while our friends were sitting in the living room around the corner without a clue! (his girlfriend had angrily left the party already). If anyone would have gotten up to go get a drink they would have seen us making out and groping each-other in the god damn kitchen! Sure enough, That party ended a bit sooner than usual, and we had fun that night. But yet, even with occurrences like that, he says he loves his girlfriend and there wont be anything more between us.

I've lived with him for a while, and even after just a year of living with him (before we had sex), I was having doubts whether or not I could continue doing so. Every time the lease renewal came up, I figured I could get over my feelings, and just live with an awesome friend and roommate, nothing more. I want to be more than friends with him, but I want to be *able to be* just friends with him. I recognize that he doesn't feel the same way about me as I feel about him, and I'm struggling very hard to be content with that, especially in light of our recent interactions.

Just recently, after 3 years of living together, I decided to tell him that I think it would be better for my well-being to not be roommates with him. I drunkenly decided to cut it off, as it definitely was/is taking an emotional toll on me. Especially when his girlfriend came around.

I acknowledge that I'm jealous of his girlfriend. I'd be oblivious to think that my judgment isn't clouded by that. The hardest part about splitting up is that I don't think his relationship is going to last. He's come to me a few times with doubts about continuing his relationship, and me, trying to be the helpful friend, tried to minimize his fears and concerns. In reality, his girlfriend is uptight, has a really abrasive personality, and frequently throws tantrums (I shit you not, storm out of the room yelling, 100 miles away from home yet demanding to ""leave this instant""-style tantrums). If she doesn't get her way, she gets mad, and from my perspective, she's got my friend by the balls. Still... somehow... he says he loves her.

I feel like I pushed him to take a step he didn't want to take when I told him him ""I think its best if we don't live together anymore"". His intent was to live with me another year before I told him my thoughts. Now, he's looking for options, a good opportunity to rent a condo came up (though his girlfriend's friend), and he's going to go for it.

All in all, I don't know what to do, and I need help.... I'm fairly certain that many of you have been in a situation where you had non-reciprocated feelings, but have any of you decided that enough is enough, and pulled the cord on what was otherwise a really awesome friendship? How'd it turn out? I'm afraid that I'm going to regret living without him, and scared that I trashed our relationship for no good reason. I feel like its the right choice for me, and being away from him will help me get over him, but at the same time, I don't know what I'm going to do living alone. We've had just enough interaction to make me think that regardless of what he says, there could be something more between us. He's been my best friend for years, I love him, and the thought of living without him is just as depressing as the thought of living with him and his girlfriend.

Someone please tell me I made the right choice.

Listen,  I am a 23 yo gay guy from Ecuador. 

I have been in an online relationship with a handsome american man who I'm going to meet for the first time next month.
I'm so excited!!!

The problem is that he wants me to stay there in the states (illegally), he can help me because I'm only have a tourist visa ( I can't stay more than 3 months in the usa) but if I get caught I could be deported to my country without any other chance to visit America.

I don't wanna be a 3rd class citizens a cause of my possible future illegal status but at the same time i will never be happy in my shitty undeveloped country.

Here the police arrest people just because they look gay,  religion has a lot of power, theres no laws against discrimination and gay marriage is something impossible to happen in our lifetime... 

I am young and I wanna be free,  I wanna love a man and be myself,  without being constantly fighting conservative people and suffer discrimination. Here, I can even lose my job If my homophobe boss find out that I am homosexual. 

Here, there's not gay clubs or associations where I can meet people like me.  The gay scene is reduced to shameful and anonymous sex. 
I really hate my country.

Even my parents and relatives are a bunch of bigots.
I don't fucking know.
Maybe this is my one and only opportunity to be happy. 

You have it all there in America,  you don't know how fucking lucky you are.  Stop complaining about small things. Be happy. 

I really don't wanna be another immigrant more to fill your hate,  but try to put yourself on my shoes for a minute.

I don't know where is my fucking place. 
Sorry for my shitty English.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello. I need a piece of advice from you guys.

I&amp;#39;m so excited!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that he wants me to stay there in the states (illegally), he can help me because I&amp;#39;m only have a tourist visa ( I can&amp;#39;t stay more than 3 months in the usa) but if I get caught I could be deported to my country without any other chance to visit America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t wanna be a 3rd class citizens a cause of my possible future illegal status but at the same time i will never be happy in my shitty undeveloped country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here the police arrest people just because they look gay,  religion has a lot of power, theres no laws against discrimination and gay marriage is something impossible to happen in our lifetime... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am young and I wanna be free,  I wanna love a man and be myself,  without being constantly fighting conservative people and suffer discrimination. Here, I can even lose my job If my homophobe boss find out that I am homosexual. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, there&amp;#39;s not gay clubs or associations where I can meet people like me.  The gay scene is reduced to shameful and anonymous sex. 
I really hate my country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even my parents and relatives are a bunch of bigots.
I don&amp;#39;t fucking know.
Maybe this is my one and only opportunity to be happy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have it all there in America,  you don&amp;#39;t know how fucking lucky you are.  Stop complaining about small things. Be happy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really don&amp;#39;t wanna be another immigrant more to fill your hate,  but try to put yourself on my shoes for a minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know where is my fucking place. 
Sorry for my shitty English.&lt;/p&gt;

I've started dating a guy, really like him. Never really dated a guy before, just some random hookups and fwb type things. He's super cool, loves to cuddle, we have a lot of the same interests, really sweet, aka love spending time with him. But, there be an issue. We've cuddled and made out a lot, and I'm quite hard during that. But when we got frisky (pants came off), I went soft. Understandable I guess, I had just jacked off the day before. We saw a movie together later that week, but when we saw each other today (5 days since I last jo), had dinner, cuddled and stuff which was great and I was hard for a lot of, but again, we started jacking each other off, and I went soft.

Now, extenuating circumstances. First time I had accidently taken some new allergy medicine right before he got to my place, didnt realize it had a side-effect of drowsiness. Makes sense I guess. Today he kinda accidentally kneed me in the balls while we were tickling each other. Still, my confidence is kinda shaken.

I'm studying abroad in the UK, so the stress of being abroad is just starting to hit me simultaneously, and admittedly my sex drive overall in the past week or so has been not very high (I havent wanted to jack off at all). 

What's happening here? How can I get over this nervousness? Admittedly, I usually go for guys that are bigger than me (although I'm 6'0 so that's not always easy), but I definitely find him attractive, and like I said, I'm quite hard when I'm cuddling and wrestling with him and such.

***Disclaimer: I know the following could be disgusting. Some of you may even think I am trolling but, this is 100% true and I am desperate!***

I'll cut to the chase: I'm in a long distance relationship. Last time I saw my boyfriend was in August and we have been having unprotected sex for quite some time now (we both have been tested, no need to discuss this). Most of the time he'd cum inside me and shortly after I would 'dispose' of his...bodily fluids. Last time we had sex, he came inside me and I recall he was in quite deep.

 A week later, I got a very bad stomach ache, it was as if someone had inflated my belly. I then went to the toilet and I let out a huge amount of air and a little cum. This would happen on &amp; off every 2-3 days. Then, weeks would go by without any problems and then it would happen again. It's been 2.5 months since the last time we had sex and I'm still 'evacuating' cum. Sometimes it makes my belly hurt and sometimes it doesn't. Now, I know some of you might be thinking 'it can't be cum!'. Trust me. **IT IS**. I just know. (Plus, he cums A LOT)

So, the thing is my boyfriend is worried that it might be something else and he urges me to go see a doctor. Unfortunately, there's a set of problems: I currently live in a foreign country and I don't speak the language that well yet - even if I went to a doctor what would I tell them? ""Hey, doc. I got cum inside my rectum, can you help me?""

Has anyone else ever had that problem?

Thank you in advance!

*P.S: I apologize if I've made any mistakes*

--- **EDIT** ---

Thanks for your input everyone. I will try finding a doctor.

I apologize if anyone was disgusted by my post.
