Kyle has been trying to interest his boyfriend  by changing things up so usually Kyle always makes Jamie cum but lately Jamie has been less hands on as he use to be. They haven't had sex in a while because Jamie said that Kyle is a bad top but Kyle has open to the idea of being vers if Jamie becomes vers as well, but Jamie says no. Or he will say anything to just shut him up. He has told him time and time again that they will work on it. 


It's been a month since they had that talk. 
Nothing has changed. 

Jamie has a issue with showing emotion. His ""I love you"" are blank or meaning less sometimes. Jamie has a issue with them showing PDA  In Front of his of his roommates. (""You don't do that in front of roommates like that."") I understand that if they haven't been dating for 5 months.

Let's call him S.
They've known each other since my bf was 14. 
He once said S got the tip of his cock in my bf(he now denies ever saying that or argues with me to stop bringing it up). I believe this happened when my bf was a minor, but let's ignore the pedophilia for now, as my bf does. S likes younger, straight acting men. 

While we were broken up for awhile, he called me drunk one night to pick him up from S's. Once there, he was acting crazy. He then grabbed S and kissed him, and then repeated, ""she knows"". I took him home.

Later on I found out he gave S head that night(he had a home at this time). Said it was gross. He was playing with idea of being gay after our breakup but said guys, and cock, are gross. Said girls are crazy and wanted to try guys, due to less drama. Says he is nothing but straight now. 100% 

We got back together and months later S is in the picture again. My bf was kicked out of his house and not allowed at mine. We only had his car to sleep/hang in, which actually worked fine. We had a nice layout, foam mattress in there. I stayed with him while he was homeless because of fear of him thinking I only could date him while he was in a house, but my love went deeper I told myself. I didn't want suicidal guy to be even more down, too.


Then it started getting cold so he would stay at S's. He told me how S always hit on him. I interregated and found out my bf kissed him and would sometimes even sleep in the same bed to wake up to him being spooned and cuddled. My boyfriend said he hated it, and would get mad at me for asking about it. It was as if he was getting molested every morning, he said. I even noticed him getting beard burn...


***I allowed it to happen because he was essentially homeless and living in his car, and this really was his only option.*** Maybe that's why he allowed it. He said nothing more happened...argued about it, but he always won convincing me there wasn't anything going on he wasn't telling me.


Finally, he found a room to rent and left. He sometimes still goes to hang with S. Mind you - they've been friends for a long time. He says nothing has happened and the guy stopped hitting on him as much cus he figured nothing's going to happen anymore since he has a gf who disapproved of it(caused lots of arguments) and he has a house now. S calls and they still sometimes hang out. 


I have asked my bf if he is bi or gay. Sometimes I come at him meanly, I admit. Other times, nicely. Yet he is adamant that he is 100% straight, loves me, is attracted to me. He believes I'm being insecure, paranoid and should trust him. 

So I did trust him.  I think he stopped doing stuff with S mid November. Last 2 months our sex life has declined. I brought it up to him. Not much has changed. He blames it on us only being able to hang/have sex in the car. He blames me for not taking off my clothes, or trying. I have slept naked, worn skirts, sent sexy pix, started giving him head...and nothing. Lately he has been having problems staying hard too. 

He drinks nightly. Smokes cigarettes. Is going through depression/suicidal/stress. Got a job a month ago, and works a lot. Use to be hardcore obsessed with his ex girlfriend(prevented us dating for a year, says he is over her, still thinks about her daily, and the regrets, but ""hates"" her for what she has done). 
He still somewhat hits on me and gets horny. Watches porn(could it be too much porn). Has been with 35ish girls. 


He knows I want more sex. Knows I think he's gay/bi. Knows I think he's not attracted, cheating, ect. He has gone so far lately as to completely deny ever giving S head.

Lots more issues, but this is mainly the big problem. I'm not asking if I should leave him, because it's clear I should...but I'm not going to. I want to know how to ask if he is gay/bi. Or how to find out. Or if you guys believe he is. If he is depressed/cheating. What could cause a guy to not be that into sex? Could a straight guy really behave gay for shelter?

***
tl:dr;; Boyfriend has messed around with 40 year old gay guy in past and claims it was for shelter. Says he is 100% straight. Also use to be obsessed with his ex gf for a long time, and still might be. Or cheating. What could cause a guy to not be that into sex with his girlfriend? And most importantly, how can I find out what is the cause?***

I was on the verge of coming out and looking for new experiences and he was looking for someone to keep his bed warm, someone to date and love and to be loved in return. 

For additional info i wasnt exactly what you would call a stable person at the time. I was suffering from depression, was having trouble figuring out my own identity and had nothing going for me in terms of social status and things that guys look for. Closeted, no job, no friends, closed off personality, basically homeless, damaged emotionally and basically the last thing anyone would want to date. I wouldnt have even dated me. This is important because a lot of these things are still relevant today and also because I gave him a fair warning before dating me and told him all the broken things about me and in return he kissed me and told me that he was here for me no matter what. 

So I decided to date him. He was completely my type on the surface. Cute, independent and basically the opposite of me. Multiple jobs, his own apartment, the largest friend net ive ever seen anyone have (seriously,,, tons and tons of people who love him to death). It was exhausting at first. He would pick me up from my place about 3-4 times a week and take me out and pay for me to drink with him and his friends and just enjoy eachothers company. I felt guilty at first and hesitated but he told me that he doesnt mind spending money on things he wants and what he wanted more than anything was for me to be with him. 

So our relationship bloomed and soon I was spending more nights at his place then I was my own and would only return home when he left for work. Things were going great. I had just come out and I had someone who made me feel secure and loved, things ive never really fealt before. Then something major happened in my family which caused me to hit a wall of depression which also marked the first issue I realized between us. He was not a man of comfort. He could make a million people smile with his humor and charm but as soon as it came to the negative aspects of life he became a shell. He didnt know what to say or do as I sat there with a lit cigarette and welling eyes. He didnt touch me or hug me or tell me things were going to be ok. He just stood there, awkward and confused and just looked at me. I had known previously that he was not one who could deal with deep issues, he simply didnt know how to. He preferred talks about celebrities or the weather and should anything serious be broughten up he would just joke and laugh it off. He realized this was a problem and told me he would work on it so that he wouldnt steamroll over my feelings seeing as I was a very sensitive person but that didnt really last long. 

About 4 months into the relationship I moved in unofficially. Everyone thought it was fast but we had spent every one of those free minutes with each other so it fealt like we had been dating for years. I didnt have any friends so I didnt mind it and he didnt seem to mind tagging me along each time he went out to see his. Soon though I started to feel unwelcomed. He would just get in a mood and act cold towards me. I thought maybe it was because I spent so much time at his place but he denied it and said he wants me there. I still felt this way so I found a shitty part time to help pay for our outings and for food and rent and that seemed to be the answer for our problems for a little while. 

After I got comfortable working late hours at my new job we sort of stopped going out as much together. Pretty much completely. We would stay home together until either of us worked then he would use my late hour job as an opportunity to go out alone and drink. It hurt my feelings because I sort of got to this point with him where I didnt want to be away from him and here he was enjoying himself only when I wasnt there. 

This has happened pretty much every single week since. Sometimes when we do go out together he ignores me completely which would be fine if he didnt do the same at home. All we do together now is eat and watch netflix in silence abd its breaking my heart but at the same time im growing frustrated and resentful towards him. Every time he ignores a text I feel like breaking my phone and everytime he leaves me all alone like today to go hang out with friends it makes me really upset. 

Now heres the thing. He was my first and I love him. I really really do. I was unsure the first few months because I didnt think I could but I know I do. And just so me and you are clear reader, I know im a large part of the problem. Im needy and jealous and overthink everything and I let small things upset me to the point where they ruin my day but even with this awareness I have no idea what to do.

I made him my everything and gave him everything. My heart, time and devotion and now that doesnt seem like its enough. I feel so stupid staring at these blank walls waiting for someone whos been gone all day to come home drunk just so he can pass out next to me, too belligerent to see that i am upset and talk to me about it. 

I guess i really feel torn apart because I allowed myself to love this person moreso than he does me. I dont leave him for a second when hes drunk but I have been left multiple times, even left me behind once. I used to make sure to smile wide and kiss him deeply each day after he got home for work but now I have stopped and he doesnt even notice. I spent the better parts of Christmas by myself because he was at home sleeping with a hangover abd Valentines day because he would rather drink with friends then have dinner with me.

I just feel so sick. I feel dumb. I feel broken again. And the worse part about all of this is things will not change and still I will be here waiting in our bed for him to get home because ive forgotten how to sleep alone.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I met my bf on a dating app about 6 months ago.

We live together, but we only seem to have time for anal sex on Saturday nights.  During the week we will maybe have oral at least once.  Since we're busy, we usually masturbate separately so we can focus on work we bring home. 

Anyway, we're both versatile, but I've become more of a bottom. Our Saturday night routine usually consists of oral and other things before we lead up to anal. During this ""transition"" period, he lubes both of us up and prepares my hole.  More and more frequently, he loses his boner during this period and can't get it back.

Last night, I guess he tried to avoid this and while I went to go shower, he said he's going to look at porn. When I was done, he said ""man, I wanted to jerk off. Let's get going!"" He was rock hard too. We did our little routine, but it was shorter this time. And once again, he lost his boner. He couldn't get it back.  

He ended up getting me off, and he came with a semi-erection.

I am patient and I understand, but it is a little bit embarrassing for both of us. It makes me feel like he doesn't get turned on by me and he feels embarrassed that he can't get it up anymore. Since I love him, I want to work with him and find ways of maintaining his erection. 

One idea I was thinking about was to prep my hole before sex, since it apparently distracts him. This would cut down the time during transitioning to anal.    I also told him not to jerk off 3 days before, but I am not sure if that's feasible for him.

I'm in a bit of a predicament in identifying what I'm attracted to sexually and romantically. This may get a little long depending on how much I get into it! I'll start from the beginning!

I don't have the *greatest* father in the world - from as long as I remember he abused me, my siblings, and my mother. I won't go into any details about this, but he's been getting better for a few years and although is a little crazy and very bad-tempered, he tries to be a better person, although honestly I don't think I'd ever be able to forgive him.
Because of this I don't think I ever got the chance to really identify with or feel like I had a caring father, or do things you would usually do with your father.

For a few years now, I've known that I'm both gay and sexually attracted to older men. I never thought anything more of it, although recently I've been questioning things a little.
I have a theory that maybe I'm attracted to older guys because of the absence of a caring father, and I'm unconsciously looking for a substitute to fill some kind of void inside me (very Freudian, this!). Because of this, I feel like maybe if I was to get into a relationship with an older guy it'd be very selfish of me and perhaps a little creepy! Bear in mind I have no incestual thoughts - although a little roleplay doesn't bother me the idea of real incest doesn't sit too well!

I feel like I would love a caring relationship with an older guy, and despite this I'm still attracted to almost exclusively older guys' bodies. Not much about younger guys turn me on (mainly hairier/chubbier guys), and as far as I can tell I have no sexual attraction for women!

This was a fairly poor explanation, I apologise - very patchy in areas, but hopefully you get the gist! I'm just confused at whether this would just be a stage, or if I'll be like this forever, or what!
Part of what sparked this is that I've been having thoughts about what would happen if I ever did come out, and although I feel like I could handle coming out as gay, telling someone I'm into older guys sounds like pretty damn intimidating, and I have a feeling people would be far less accepting of it! 
I'd rather not get into any specifics but I'm still fairly young and I have a long way to go in life, to find myself, but this is just something I've been wanting to get off my chest for a while. I'm having thoughts that maybe I'm straight, not gay, and this is just a stage I'll need to surpass due to my lack of a *real* father to get back on the intended course. I don't know. It's probably just black and white and I'm over-thinking it.

I should probably also identify my idea of an older man - I'd say 35 to 60 is my main type range, with 35 pushing it a little!

Boy I've rambled on a lot. Sorry.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello! I&amp;#39;m in a bit of a predicament in identifying what I&amp;#39;m attracted to sexually and romantically. This may get a little long depending on how much I get into it! I&amp;#39;ll start from the beginning!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t have the &lt;em&gt;greatest&lt;/em&gt; father in the world - from as long as I remember he abused me, my siblings, and my mother. I won&amp;#39;t go into any details about this, but he&amp;#39;s been getting better for a few years and although is a little crazy and very bad-tempered, he tries to be a better person, although honestly I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;d ever be able to forgive him.
Because of this I don&amp;#39;t think I ever got the chance to really identify with or feel like I had a caring father, or do things you would usually do with your father.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a few years now, I&amp;#39;ve known that I&amp;#39;m both gay and sexually attracted to older men. I never thought anything more of it, although recently I&amp;#39;ve been questioning things a little.
I have a theory that maybe I&amp;#39;m attracted to older guys because of the absence of a caring father, and I&amp;#39;m unconsciously looking for a substitute to fill some kind of void inside me (very Freudian, this!). Because of this, I feel like maybe if I was to get into a relationship with an older guy it&amp;#39;d be very selfish of me and perhaps a little creepy! Bear in mind I have no incestual thoughts - although a little roleplay doesn&amp;#39;t bother me the idea of real incest doesn&amp;#39;t sit too well!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like I would love a caring relationship with an older guy, and despite this I&amp;#39;m still attracted to almost exclusively older guys&amp;#39; bodies. Not much about younger guys turn me on (mainly hairier/chubbier guys), and as far as I can tell I have no sexual attraction for women!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a fairly poor explanation, I apologise - very patchy in areas, but hopefully you get the gist! I&amp;#39;m just confused at whether this would just be a stage, or if I&amp;#39;ll be like this forever, or what!
Part of what sparked this is that I&amp;#39;ve been having thoughts about what would happen if I ever did come out, and although I feel like I could handle coming out as gay, telling someone I&amp;#39;m into older guys sounds like pretty damn intimidating, and I have a feeling people would be far less accepting of it! 
I&amp;#39;d rather not get into any specifics but I&amp;#39;m still fairly young and I have a long way to go in life, to find myself, but this is just something I&amp;#39;ve been wanting to get off my chest for a while. I&amp;#39;m having thoughts that maybe I&amp;#39;m straight, not gay, and this is just a stage I&amp;#39;ll need to surpass due to my lack of a &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; father to get back on the intended course. I don&amp;#39;t know. It&amp;#39;s probably just black and white and I&amp;#39;m over-thinking it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should probably also identify my idea of an older man - I&amp;#39;d say 35 to 60 is my main type range, with 35 pushing it a little!
I&amp;#39;ve probably missed a few things out unintentionally, so if you have any questions I&amp;#39;ll try to answer!

I was blowing him as he was kneeling on the bed, and he politely let me know that I needed to get it a little wetter...well before I could even do anything about it, he drops a wad of his own spit on his dick and winks at me, so i kept sucking him but with his own spit mixed in, and I *almost* blew my load right away just from hot it was.

But I think he could tell how much I liked it, so he said ""look up at me"" so I looked up and then he spit right into my mouth (I know I've seen this before in porn, but it's usually in a very aggressive/dominant manner, and this was more just playful), and I was barely even touching myself, but that put me over the edge and I came hard.

I am 21 years old, and I have started doubting my sexuality 2 years ago. This is the deal:

I am an only child, and I grew up in a christian family, with my parents, where I was always the center of attention. My mother worries too much, and my parents are pretty strict, so I didn't get that much social intertaction with my peers when I was a little. Hell, I didn't even go to kindergarten. This meant that I wasn't really socialy evolved by the time I started elementary school, so I was always ""the quiet kid"". I would often get picked on, and I didn't have many friends, maybe one or two at most. I didn't know how to act around people, either. Anyway, there had been a big turning point in my life, after which I decided to start being more social and start going out and freaking living my life. This meant a lot of trouble with my parents, but I struggled through it and survived. Anyway, this was when I was 18 years old, and at that time I started hanging out with a new group of friends. One of them was my neighbour, and with time we became extremely close. So close, that I felt like I fell in love with him. I questioned my feeling many times, but I realised that it was genuine. Now, I have always liked men in a weird, different way, never was really attracted to girls other than thinking that they're just pretty. But, whenever I would be attracted to a man, I would dismiss the feeling, because I was raised to be deeply religious. My religiousness and my parents were pretty much the reason I never gave the gay thing any chance. Anyways, one evening I came home high af, and all of a sudden I started having gay fantasies while I was in bed. I became hard in an instant and had the best orgasm of my life. Since then, I started having more and more gay fantasies, reading gay erotic stories and even started masturbating to gay porn. All of that makes me extremely aroused.

You wouldnt believe how much this kid can pester me about invariably futile conclusions.  I try to explain to him that behaviors have potentials and Im going to do what Im going to do.  Bitching to me is just a way to guarantee the function of A to B is an ugly one.  Anyways I go to the grocery store because Im hungry.  

I got a little high this morning, so what.  Well I park my car and its a girl I swear I know from high school.  You all know her as so-and-so.  She was at all the parties, she never dated really, what was her name again?  So i wait in my car until shes gone out - takes her a while though.

At this point I need help from you guys.  Is this something gay people do or just people do?  Ive always felt especially bad with names, but also equally can jump to confirmation bias when it comes to faces.  I mean, that bitch knows me but she doesnt *know* me.

But back to the story, when I walk into the store theres a lone boy standing in the eaves of the exits that I know.  I know him.  This time my mind is a total blank, I dont know what ethereal force-behind-the-curtain is telling me that.  Which gives way to me *recognizing* but not remembering him.  I make a bee line for any aisle, its hopeless if he turns now - theres no cover in sight.  And im a pretty commandingly large figure in any room.

He looks at me, big blue eyes, and smiles.  Says my name.  

I opened my mouth and walked toward him, nothing came out and i felt my hands doing the Ricky Bobby as I grasped for anything from the air in front of me.  That was it, when I felt it.  It was like a shot passing through me, like the feeling of being shot.  Ive never been shot but i work construction so i know the feeling of something penetrating and obliterating your flesh and tissues with explosive force.  I felt physical pain, right in the pit of my chest!  I swear to god I dont want to leave it out of the story and i wish it kind of didnt happen as im typing it out but I know for a fact I was hunched over slightly and clutching my heart with my right hand.  I tried to conceal the hand gestures with a tug and pull of my shirt.  I dont think it was my voice when I was talking to him.  I dont know what I said, some total word vomit garbage.  

And then he asked about the kid everyone knew i was notoriously gay for in high school.  I told him we werent friends as much, in so so so many words.  I think he was offended that I had the air of wanting to pull away form that conversation but i was DROWNING!  God i just wanted to come up for air but no.  Of course im thinking the whole time i wish he would admit he was gay and then ask me to fuck him in the backseat of his car in this parking lot.

Then as a compromise I actually allow myself to think its ok to hope that he's gonna try to contact me and be gay and want me to kiss him and let me play with his cock.

Either being gay is fucked up or I am or its both but idk, I certainly didnt get any cause to ever want to go out into public again after today.  I mean I dont know where to begin to be ok.  Regardless of who it is one of the very first things that flashes into my conscious awareness of my interactions with people is being afraid they will perceive me as gay.  Like I look for it, in their eyes, when they are thinking about my sexuality in the present scenario.

So instead of dealing with the anxiety the theme of my life has been to live on the edge, to be poised to make my escape, first and undetected.  Some people think its sneaky, and want to impose themselves by the minutes into my daily affairs.  Some people think its sexy and mysterious.

Youngest by only a few minutes-- the doctor decided to pull my brother out of our mother's womb a few minutes before me. My parents are proud to remind my brother and me that we are Reagan babies, just narrowly avoiding the cutoff.

And so, seven pounds and four ounces of me was yanked into this world yelling and screaming, not knowing what would await me. It wasn't long before I learned about Jesus, God, and the Pope. The ultimate sacrifice that Jesus paid to atone for my sins. One sin in particular would come to haunt my middle school altar boy mind: how hot I found other boys to be and how little I noticed any girls.

And thus I was plagued with guilt about my homosexuality. I knew I could never tell anyone, not even my twin brother. He didn't think highly of fags. No one in my all-male Catholic high school did. I lived in Tennessee after all.

I kept my secret so well, or so I thought. Spring of my junior year, my parents called me home one Friday night when I was out with my brother and friends. When I walked inside the doorway and my parents made mention of knowing my secret, I went weak in the knees and fell against the wall. My life was over.

No it wasn't, said my parents. We love you and want only the best for you. We will help you overcome homosexuality and become the straight man that God made you to be. This will be the ultimate battle of your life, but Jesus is on your side. The stakes are so high-- your life in eternity is on the line. 

I was so relieved. It was a weight off my shoulder to no longer be hiding this secret from my parents. And I was finally going to be able to rid myself of homosexuality, something I had dreamed of doing for years. That weekend I entered therapy sessions with a recovered homosexual. He was going to share with me the secrets of becoming straight.

I quit watching porn like he told me. I quit masturbating as he demanded. I read the Bible, prayed every morning and night, and filled myself with the Spirit. I read books by ex-homosexual Christians and books about homosexuality by Christian psychologists. I did everything he said I needed to do, and I felt so good about myself... at first.

At first I was so optimistic, assured that my seventeen-year-old self would become heterosexual in short order. But time gradually passed and nothing really changed. Junior year ended, summer passed and senior year started, I turned 18, and before long senior year began to wane.

I grew increasingly despondent. I slipped up on occasion: I sometimes masturbated. The ex-gay counselor told me that if things weren't improving for me, it was due to my failings. Masturbating was especially egregious. The counselor informed me that God was not happy with me, and I was flirting will Hell. When he said those words to me, I felt awful for a moment. But then, my eyes blinked and all the sudden I realized that I was living in some kind of a bizzaro world. 

Everything was backwards from what they were telling me: I wasn't the one who was fucked up; rather, everyone who was trying to make me straight was. God wasn't using this ex-gay counselor to help guide me on the path towards righteousness; in contrast, it was this ex-gay counselor who was using God as a weapon to force his wacko ideology on me. I continued this train of thought one step further and realized that in fact, God did not create man, man created God. For me, God was dead.

Despite this realization, any self-esteem I had ever had was long since gone. My parents had made it clear that a homo would not be welcome in the family. Fags were constantly derided at school. Gays had been thoroughly demonized in the battle for a constitutional amendment banning marriage equality in Tennessee. It seemed like family, friends, and society at large were all against me. I would never be welcome at the table.

College was unremarkable. I was on my own living a few hours away from any family member. I was free from ex-gay therapy and oppressive parents, somewhat. I was more or less out of the closet, but I lived in a small town with no gay scene. There was one straight club with a “gay corner” on the dance floor. There were very few guys active on gay websites. Even if there had been opportunities to associate with other gay guys, I rarely socialized at all due to the poor state of my mental health.

In my sophomore year of college, my parents found out that I identify as gay because of my participation in a rally for gay rights. They were despondent. My father told me he felt like a failure as a father. He also threatened me saying that he and my mother would have to decide whether they were willing to financially support someone who goes against their values and morals.

My level of self-esteem was below zero. My dad's words filled me with fear, and I decided to avoid doing anything that would cause my parents to cut me off financially. I wanted to do whatever it took to be able to earn my degree.

In his anger, my father imparted one additional piece of advice: be more like your brother.

My brother... my twin. The straight one, taller and more muscular. The “good looking one”, as I've been told. The self-confident one who wasn't raised to hate himself. The golden child. Yeah, just be more like him. Thanks, Dad.

...

Well I finally graduated and found a pretty good full-time job. I live on my own in the suburbs of a large metropolitan area of the East coast. Been here three years now. It gets better, right? I thought it would, but I really wouldn't say that my situation has improved that much. My scars run so deep. I'm pretty lonely, and I've never been in a relationship.

I've started seeing a therapist recently, so hopefully I can begin to dislike the world a little less. I've got a lot of years left in me, so I may as well try to learn how to enjoy life a bit.

So I know it's been a while, but OP has delivered an update. [Here is the original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/2l0g29/my_straight_friend_gave_me_a_therapeutic_massage/). The TL;DR for that was ""My best firefighter friend offered to do a leg massage, but led to a 2 hour long massage and pseudo fondling and sexually arousing ordeal around my package that was said to be just a therapeutic massage between two really good and trusting friends. I'm not out to him yet and I don't know who he really bats for.""

Since then we still talk a lot, but we haven't had our shifts line up and I finally had a shift with him Friday. What I learned before this time is that my firefighter buddy actually jerked off one of our mutual friends and I was floored. So clearly he isn't straight...

Fast forward to this Friday, and we were doing a rig check when I flat out asked him if he knew I wasn't straight. Just like that, out of the blue. He was taken aback, but then asked about my ""friend"" from last summer and I told him we were more than that. I then went on explaining how I was just scared to come out to the station due to the culture; yet I wanted to be honest and value the camaraderie I have with my brothers. He was very surprised, but I knew by his responses that he was nervous...

After talking about how I came out to other people and my escapades...I asked him if that massage was really just a massage. At this point he broke down and said he is so confused. He hated himself for having these ""feelings"" and he cited how religious his family is. It sounded like he had a really hard time accepting his sexuality and still is. He never really came out but just admitted that he was not straight. I told him not to worry about our little massage incident and that I'll always  be there as his friend especially if he needs to talk to me about anything. 

Clearly he is so deeply closeted he found Narnia...and might have some internalized homophobia. I gave him some space and we will talk later when he feels more comfortable. Sorry if I disappointed you guys that there was no hot sex scene involving fire hoses or make out sessions on fire engines like the movie Backdraft.
