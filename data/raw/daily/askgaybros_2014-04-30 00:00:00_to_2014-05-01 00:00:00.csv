I have a problem and maybe you guys can help.

I'm 19 and at college. I came out almost two years ago, and pretty much all the sex I've ever had has been bad. The problem is this: I have never been able to really get or stay hard with another guy, no matter how cute I find him, how much he plays with my dick, etc. Consequently I've never been able come for another dude.

Recently I met a guy that I quite like (who I am praying doesn't read this shit), we've been dating and that kind of thing, but last night things got ~sexy~ and we ended up naked on his bed. Even while we were making out, getting handsy, all that stuff–my dick was just tragically soft, and his was definitely not. To make a long story short, he ended up coming, and I didn't.

While I've basically gotten used to this pattern, I think it obviously leaves the other party uncomfortable. I'm pretty neurotic by nature, so things like last night make me really scared that I'll never have a normal sex life. Maybe I need to get out of my own head during sex-time, but that's really hard for me (pun intended) to do. Am I a total Freudian headcase? What now?

Firstly, I would like to acknowledge that this can be boiled down to me complaining about my life, which I imagine most people don't give a fuck about. Also, I come from the UK, where most people accept different sexualities. I have it MUCH easier than the people from strong conservative backgrounds where they risk being essentially abandoned by their family and friends.

However,

I have pretty much come to terms with the fact that I am gay, and will not live the cookie cutter life we were all promised.

I have an urge to fully understand who I am, and become open about my 'true self', i.e. Come out. But, I don't feel like I have anyone to come out to.

My 'best' friend, I have discovered, is fairly insensitive and emotionally void. If I came out to him, he would say something like ""I knew it you bitch,"". ""So you really do want the D."" I shall go no further. He is my only close friend. I only consider myself to have one other option. (I am not that close to my family at this level.)

My only other friend seems to have a lack of interest in talking to me. I have found over time that I almost always will initiate conversation (Instant messaging), and I will yield fairly brief replies. However, occasionally we will have 2 hour long conversations about stuff. Recently I have not spoken to him, and have waited for him to show interest. He has subtly tried to find out if I am gay in the past, and I think he has realised. 

Should I share something of this nature with him? I feel like you should come out to someone with whom you are very close. Would you agree? Should I not care how much he cares about me, and just do it?

So alone.
So bitter.

I just want it to stop. I know that I am gay, I've come out of the closet to friends, I've tried dating guys, I'd have sex with guys. Why haven't I accepted that i'm gay? Why am I so furious with myself and everyone around me?

Every night on my drive home I run through dozens of scenarios in my head of coming out my family. EVERY. DAY. For the past 3 years, without fail, I run through these scenarios. Every scenario hurts. This is my life.

I'm not close with my parents at all anymore. Everything they say to me just annoys me, I don't want to be around them. I'll come home late and leave early so I can avoid seeing them. I love them but why am I so angry at them? They always say they miss me and call me a lot to come to dinner but I don't. I ignore it. I haven't spent time with my family is nearly a year I fear they think I hate them but I don't at all. But it keeps getting worse. Even my friends just anger me most of the time. Why did I even come out to them? I've never felt more afraid and lonely in my life.

I still feel weird talking about it. I still tell lies about where I am when I'm on a date. When i'm out with my friends I feel like I want to burst out and start talking about being gay. But at the same time, I resent them. I resent how carefree they are about their relationships. Their identity. They will never know the life I know and it infuriates me. I hate straight dudes at time. I hate them so much. I walk around my campus and I am full of scorn as I watch the others play frisbee. Fly kites. Play soccer with their friends and just enjoy the sun. I wish pain on all of them out of spite.

So many days I come home from either school, drinking, smoking tons of weed, etc. and just look up bad coming out stories because I feel like that's what it will be for me. I'm a black dude in a terrible neighborhood whose family is always teetering on being poor. I'm in college but I'm such an idiot to think someone like me ever has a chance to compete with my classmates. I am a pariah. I pretend to be social. I pretend to smile. 

My outlook on life is dark. All I ever do anymore is pretend I know everything and be a bitter asshole to everyone around me. I read about existentialism and nihilism day in and day out because it resonates with this worldview I have. I'm going to fail out of college and end up trapped in this slice of existence until I die. 

I can see it painfully clear. My family will be on the street and they will find out i'm gay and everything will fall apart. Why did I come out to people at all? Why did I even fool myself into thinking I was going to actually make it at this University and get out of all this? It's all fear. It's all anger. It's all confusion. It's all darkness. 

I really don't know if it's even worth it anymore.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m so angry.

At this point, while it was obviously weird to be so aggressive about contacting me, I still felt a bit guilty because I suppose I was acting a bit over-affectionate for a hookup (which is just kind of how I always am) and maybe led him on a bit to think I was interested in something more, so I was formulating something to say to let him down as nicely as possible and get him off my back.

&lt;p&gt;I guess I&amp;#39;ll just have to take this as a &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t stick your dick in crazy&amp;quot; lesson, and be more cautious about sleeping with guys who just don&amp;#39;t seem normal for whatever reason.

I am a confused young'n. Firstly I would like to preface this by saying that I am ignorant and inexperienced, and I am talking about something I have little knowledge of. Please forgive me for anything I have said that is stupid.

Edit: Already gaining a downvote makes me think that this will not be received very well. 

I was wondering how the roles of a relationship translate into gay relationships. 

This is what I have been thinking: Two guys 'fall in love' and develop a relationship. When it comes to sex however, they realise they are both tops. 

* Is one forced to bottom, and experience unpleasant sex for the other? Could they swap each time? Do they have to end the relationship?

* Are tops commonly attracted to bottoms? Is it always obvious?
Do people who identify as these roles have certain characteristics?


And my second thought:

I can look at some people and think about topping them, but also look others and get aroused by the thought of them topping me. 

* Does everyone have this two way arousal? Or will tops not be aroused by the thought of being topped. Is knowing which you are down to experimentation and experience? 

Finally I would like to say that the idea of bottoming to me feels like the bottom is emasculated, and that being 'dominated' by the top makes the 'power' in the relationship uneven. I don't know how to phrase this in a question.

Additional edit: If any of the original commenters return, I would like to thank them all for sharing their knowledge and experience.

I'm still in the closet so he doesn't know but I have hinted towards being gay. For example, there was a time where we were talking about girls and I jokingly said I'm not into females. He simply ignored me. Another thing that makes me think he is gay or at least bi is that when we both sit down on a couch, he always touches my leg with his leg even when I move my legs away (and theres a lot of space on the couch). Also, there was a time where we stared into each other eyes for literally 10 seconds. He mentioned that it was gay and i replied that it is a two way street meaning he could had stop staring. When that happened I really felt like kissing him. Lastly, I have changed in front of him when he is in my room and he looks at my boxer briefs area for a few seconds. And he is kinda shy but he also changes in front of me. I never seen him change in front of other friends. 

Is he attracted to guys? Should I stop fantasying about him and look for other guys? Should I try to make the movies plan happen and then make a move there?
