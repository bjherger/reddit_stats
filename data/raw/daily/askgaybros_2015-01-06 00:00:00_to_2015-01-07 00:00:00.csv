Feel free to skip to the end for the tl;dr

I moved to a new city a few months ago and started to network and try and get to know and date gays in the area. I ended up meeting this one guy, we can call him Kyle. At first Kyle seemed great, friendly and knew everyone. He was eager to show me around and emphasized a lot of the same values I had. And he knew everyone in the city, he was the center of a few groups of gays. 

We started to hook up a bit but he maintained that we were just friends and wanted to see where it went and wanted to see other people. I made it clear that I liked him, but I saw his reasoning. Some weird hypocritical stuff starts to happen: (him talking about his dates but him flipping out when he found out I had one). He was quick to anger and jealousy and had many expectations of me that I would reserve for a serious relationship. 

Eventually he says it isn't working and wants to be friends, then I agree and say that is best. Later he freaks out and says that I am shitty friend (for not coming to hang out when he wants) and says he doesn't think we would make good friends. Again, my sentiments were ""I don't think we need to text all the time but if that is what you need, then that is fine. Feel free to say hi if we run into each other"". He yells at me at a bar for being dramatic and then leaves. 

Later he starts texting me again about this new guy he has been seeing, I start to recognize that I want to let this die slowly so I just play along responding and listening to the issues they are having. When they start to break up he starts begging me to come meet up with him. I say no and he  flipps out saying I'm not of the standard he expects from people in his life and that he has given up on me. 

The problem: he has started to talk smack about me and in fact has ruined my interaction with at least two other guys and will probably make it harder for me to make friends with the people he knows. How do I handle this? Clearly he is at minimum very dramatic, but I also don't want him to keep bad mouthing me. I honestly have no idea how to handle someone so delusional who has so much potential to make my new life here harder.

I'm in Madrid if that adds context to it.

The first time it happened I was walking with a friend towards the food and drink area after one of my favorite bands played and these guys came up to me, and I thought they wanted me to take a picture of them so I went along with it. As the title says, I ended up taking a picture with them instead. They asked me if I wanted a picture solo, but I declined. They said bye to me and hugged me (one of them lingered a bit and I think he kissed my neck). They'd probably been drinking a bit too much.

The second time it happened I was dancing at a club with some friends and these group guys next to us tapped me on the shoulder and shook my hand and stuff. One of them pointed at another guy, and I didn't know what they were trying to say, so I just shook my head and turned away because I wasn't really into them. Later on when I was going to the bathroom, the same group of guys were calling me like ""Hey macho"" and whatnot and tapped me on the shoulder again and asked me to take a picture with another guy. He was kinda cute so I almost considered it just to talk to him more, but I was a bit weirded out and was thinking about other things anyway so I said no. A guy pulled out his phone and was about to take a picture anyway, but I turned away and went to the bathroom.

I'm asking on here because I want to know if that's really a thing. Was that their way of trying to hit on me or something? I'm kind of new to the scene, so I don't know too much about these kind of peculiarities. The fact that it happened on two separate occasions is what's making think it's not so uncommon. I'm just confused about it because I don't really see the point of it. Why would they want pictures of/with some random guy? The first time it happened, they didn't really try to do anything after (other than get a bit friendly saying bye), so they weren't trying to take me with them or something.

After failing similarly for an entire year, I'm left wondering what I'm doing wrong. Can anyone please help me figure out what I'm doing wrong?

My physical description: above average height, skinny/twink-ish build (abs not visible, but flat stomach), smooth upper body, short-trimmed stubble, blond hair, pale white skin, hairy butt/legs.

I'm a bottom, and I'm interested in mainly guys who have some scruff/stubble/beard, skinny to muscular and muscular daddies.

At the circuit-style parties, I tried wearing a shirt, being shirtless, dancing, appearing happy, smiling, dancing near guys who I liked while trying to make eye contact. None of it worked, and none of the guys who I was interested in even gave me a look.

One instance I remember is of a guy who was a bit shorter and fairly muscular. I was checking him out and dancing in his vision, trying to make eye contact, but he didn't look, or if he looked, he would just instantly look away in disinterest. I assumed that he just didn't like non-muscular guys and stopped trying to pursue. Later, I saw a twink-ish guy go up to him and somehow started making out and dancing with him. The differences - that guy was shorter than the top guy I was interested in, had dark hair, and also had somewhat-visible abs, but he wasn't *that* cute. He had a typical circuit-twink look. It made me sad, knowing that it was clear that I was just too ugly for that guy.

I feel like no one really likes blond twinks. All of the guys who were dancing with others had brown hair and/or dark facial hair. Or, the guys who I was interested in who happened to like twinks were only into Asian guys (I was surprised to find *so* many people who were exclusively into Asian guys with absolutely no exceptions - something that you don't hear about as much as people complaining about guys who are only into white guys).

At the bar, there were a TON of dark hair, scruffy guys. Most were skinny or athletic build. Again, I tried making eye contact with guy after guy who I was interested in, but none of them looked at me. I felt invisible. They were all in groups of dark hair scruffy guys, talking with other similar-looking dark hair scruffy guys, dancing with dark hair scruffy guys.

It really seems like all of these guys just want to be with someone who looks like them (so not me, as a blond guy). Unfortunately, that's my type - dark hair, scruffy guys. I don't think that's very picky at all. It's just two physical traits. Yet this seems to be what everyone's type is, and the dark hair scruffy guys don't seem to like blond twinks.

These three events recently were just the final straw. I've tried for the past year to go out and meet guys at bars and clubs, but I haven't succeeded once. My friends tell me that I should be able to find guys, and they're surprised when they find that I never have. Is it possible that I'm just a weird combo of traits that happen to be a turn-off for most men? Is it that I'm smooth on my upper body, but quite hairy on my lower half, so people who want smooth don't like me and people who want hairy don't like me (no chest hair) Is it that I'm just the only one who likes guys who are different from me? Is it that I have a feminine voice (although I doubt this is it because I don't even get to the point where I'm talking with guys, they reject me by not even looking at me).

I don't know how I'm going to get through another quarter of this. I got so stressed between classes and work, I seriously thought about excusing myself from work and going home and ending it all.

I'm intimidated by all these people who seem to be so well-adjusted. Everybody's got their social circle of friends in class, they seem to be thriving in the college, and goddamn are most of the guys hot. Everytime I see them, I'm reminded of how pathetic I am in comparison to them. Like I get really sad for the rest of the day. I want to be like them. I wish I could also just be normal friends with some people, but most people can smell unhappiness, and it makes conversations awkward. Ever heard of the ""I can't get a job because I don't have experience because I can't get a job because I don't have experience ...etc""? It's kind of like that, except I can't keep friends because I'm unhappy because I'm lonely because I'm unhappy because I'm lonely.

You know what's strange? I think I only feel this way (so worked up and depressed) when I think about the guys I see in college. I think about how well dressed they look, how confident they look, how happy they look. I noticed I don't really feel this way about girls in general. In fact I don't really think about them at all, and I'm rather unaffected. So maybe I feel this way so strongly because I want to be loved so strongly, but I know I'm nowhere near that in my current state of mind.

I don't know if this seems silly, but the pressure is really kind of intense when you're surrounded by thousands of people who just physically seem to have progressed so much further than you. You just can't help but think of yourself in comparison to them. And when you feel alone too, that's when it's a real kicker. Nobody to really turn to or talk to about this.

Hey bros.

I'm a 23yo guy and I've been battling depression since my very early teens.
In the past 4 years I've had to deal with alot of shit that noone this young should have to deal with our have lumped on them. Essentially ice been my families leaning post/shoulder to cry on/punching bag/doormat etc etc.

Long story made as short as possible: 1. Mum's dad died, mum becomes super depressed and stays drinking.  

2. 6mths later my parents who ran their own company hired a ""friend"" to help them out in the accounting side, supposed friend stole upwards 500k, never paid any bills he was supposed to etc etc, family and parents were about to lose everything.

3. I went into debt to try and save the family home and business with proviso that they give me every bit of help and support to make it successful. I got enough to save the business or at least the assets of it but not the house.

4. Parents blame me for not being able to save house or at least it feels that way. 

5. Parents buried head in the sand and I've been slowly drowning ever since in a deep black hole. 

6. Mum was involved in a fatal car accident and is now being charged with essentially vehicular manslaughter, which is a far cry from what she should be charged with.

7. We've spent 24 months in Magistrates court to only be told it has to now go to district court and will cost untold thousands at this time to fight it. 

8. Mum has become quite unstable and has been in and out of psych facilities since the accident. 

9. Dad doesn't cope well. He stresses and takes it out on me. 

10. I've been attempting law school for three years and have failed each time because I've got to attend to family matters or just simply can't cope. Then I'm accused by family of wasting time and money. 

11. My family and i struggle financially. Dad works for another company but didn't earn much and barely makes ends meet. I'm working full time and trying to start my life as an independent man but have to help prop up my family when they get short on cash - dad works casual so doesn't get paid sick or holiday pay or when there's a short shortage of work. 

12. I've battled depression since my early teens. Got help once in my late teens. But have pretty much self medicated/sucked it up and dealt with it because I'm an idiot.

13. I've been dating a guy for the past 13 months. They've been the happiest I've been in years. He made me able to bear or forget about the other shit (for the most part except on two extreme circumstances 1. When my mum tried committing suicide and 2. When she tried it the second time).

But lately things haven't been so good. He's almost cheated on me twice in the past 4 months. But he's stopped himself both times because he realised he was only going to do it because I'd hurt him (it was after the two suicide attempts by my mum, i lost it at him big time over nothing and i hadn't told him about mum because i was too ashamed) and he was going to do it out of spite and to get back at me by doing what i incorrectly accused him of doing. He says he couldn't go through with either because he loved me too much and felt like shit for even thinking about it. I forgave him because i know nothing happened. 

But since finding out I've been overly suspicious of who he hangs with and what he's doing to the point i demand to know where he is and who he is every few hrs (i know this is unhealthy and wrong and i want to change it FAST), very clingy, very easily angered (my depression manifests as anger rather than crying and weeping), I've been almost trying to find reasons to be upset with him, I've been actually burring up at my dad's attempts to cause arguments and fights when i usual just ignored it (I've come close to decking him but have had my little sister jump in the middle of us).

Throughout all this I've had to deal with my mum, be her support person, be my sisters support, my brothers, I've been their rock, I've been dads venting outlet for his anger and frustration, I've been their atm, their on call therapist. 

Noone has really stopped to ask how I'm going, how I'm feeling, how in dealing, if I'm coping. They just assume I'm OK. That I'll be able to carry this all. I don't say anything because the one time i did i was given the guilt trip of a lifetime and berated with the good old ""you think you've got it bad, you don't have to deal with etc etc). it makes me so fucking angry at how selfish everyone in my life is.  

I want to stop being like this and to be happy again. I want my Pup to no longer feel worried or scared in going to snap at him. I just want to be normal and stop hurting inside and stop being everyone's sounding board/doormat. 

I have to call my dr at lunch at with today to sort out an appointment to get a referral to a psychologist because i refuse to use antidepressants again. 

I don't know why i posted. I'm not looking for sympathy. I think i just needed to vent and let it out. Maybe see if anyone can relate?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;***** UPDATE - &lt;/p&gt;

Background:



So, Ive been with a few guys in one night stands now which is awesome! But I have major body issues and its pretty much entirely because I have a hairy ass &gt;_&lt; I hate it!! All these times I actually planned in advance and got myself waxed, it was somewhat torturous but it gave me a *massive* confidence boost!! My hair isn't crazy thick, but like the consistency it is on my legs carries on up my ass and ends in a little fluffy patch on my lower back. So now I want to see about getting a boyfriend or trying some sort of relationship, but the thought of my hairy ass and guys being put off is making me panic!! :(


The Question:


How can I deal with my ass hair long term?? Are there any methods that are better for consistent results or consistent use? Have you ever been in a relationship where you and/or you partner do anything about it? I'm worried putting someone off, especially if it grows back and scares them off!

I personally never thought sex addiction existed and was all a ploy to kill all the fun out of casual sex...something made up by crazy christian preachers. 

But now after a few years of being out and having had a lot (and I mean a lot) of hookups (nightclub tricks, grindr, sex clubs etc) I think I definitely have a problem. I can't seem to stop seeking out sex and it follows all the classic addiction symptoms.

I've been dealing with this off and on for a few years, but when it would flair up in the past I thought it was just an simple ingrown hair, and they always went away.

It too went away then, so by the time I was considering seeing a doctor, there was no point. Well it's back and just as painful as it was last time, if not a little more so. Unfortunately, I don't have health insurance since I was laid off from my job, and I live in one of those douchebag states that didn't accept ACA. On the bright side, I might be getting a new job soon, so hopefully I can wait for my next round of health insurance to get it completely fixed.


Anyways, I was reading up, and I'm assuming I have a very bad... not the worst possible, but bad case of it considering just how many ""holes"" I have.

So as it usually goes I met this guy in one of my courses ( I'm at uni) and I quite like him. He's gay, we started talking and actually went for a burger and beer and had a good time ( we talked for so long that we were the last remaining in the pub when it was closing). That happened before the christmas break. He also told me that he's not looking for anything more than a friend right now and that he met someone back home and he can't wait to meet him again during christmas. We are both studying far away from home. 

So basically what I'm asking is what should I do? Was he just polite when he was saying that he's not looking for anyone or is he not attracted to me? Also I'm the one who starts conversations on fcb. I would like to be more than friends with him because he's really cute and nice.

However, I can't help but feel super weird about him.

Some background...

I am currently in my last year of college out of town. The majority of my friends stayed for college in my hometown. I see most of them every break when I go back. I came out to two very good female friends while in high school. They took it very well and were very supportive. However, I hadn't come out to anyone in my hometown since then.

 Until  I told my male best friend last week. We were a little drunk and I decided that fuck it, it is finally time for me to be happy. I thought that coming out might be a good first step. He took it really well and said that we will always be friends. However, now I feel extremely ambivalent about him. One moment I am super thankful and want to hang out with him and chat around. Other times I just can't stand him and don't want to see his face or talk to him ever again. The very next day I told him he kept texting to me  like we usually do to show that everything was normal. But I felt it was a little forced. During our drunk conversation I also told him how I wasn't able to look my female friend in the eye nor talk to her the first time I came out. He said that I ""better don't do that to him."" Which I thought was a little sweet. 

Since then I've been feeling a pain in my chest that I cannot quite name. I thought that maybe by talking to him and telling him how I felt would help to ease the pain a little bit. However, when I tried to bring it up yesterday he just brushed it off. I expected it from him because he is not the kind that likes to talk about his feelings or emotions in general. 

What should I do? I know I should be thankful because he is supportive. I know I am being a baby by complaining about this and believe me, no one knows my faults better than me. I wouldn't have come here if I didn't know what to do. I just want to know if this is normal and if any of  you experienced a similar phase. I also just wanted to tell this to someone who might understand a little bit how I feel. I love him to death but I also don't want to speak to him again...

The last 12-24 months have been a whirlwind of emotions (good and bad), social awkwardness and personal development. I want to share some thoughts on ugly duckling issues and see what challenges you experienced and how you dealt with it. (For info on the ugly duckling idea, see: http://www.khaleejtimes.com/kt-article-display-1.asp?xfile=data/opinion/2014/December/opinion_December32.xml&amp;section=opinion)  

Here are a few of my thoughts and experiences:

Me: 30 y/o white guy from the Midwest. I’ve always considered myself a player gaybro, no qualms about it and no judgment…going out, flirting and meeting guys I’m attracted to is one of the most rewarding past times I can think of. I have plenty of interests and personal successes, but there’s nothing more fun to me than shy courting that turns into flirty, mutually entertaining conversation (that usually ends with a few texts and a good acquaintance) with a guy I’m attracted to. Even considering this, however, I’ve always known and accepted the rules of the game; which first and foremost is playing within your own league. Granted, there are always exceptions, but it’s nothing but clear that 10s want a 10, and where you fall on landing a guy in the lower spectrums depends on your game (social abilities essentially) and your own range of attractiveness. I’m not being shallow, I fully recognize there is any number of potential scales of attractiveness, but, as a gaybro, my scale of attractive is based on the athletic gaybro types. I’m glad I accepted this fact early on, because it has helped me avoid much embarrassment, let down and bitterness with failed attempts to date, hookup or simply socialize. That being said, up to about two years ago I was a solid 6, nothing wrong with that at all..in my book. Being a 6, I comfortably, happily and to much enjoyment was glad to play in the 5-8 range.

Due to a series of fortunate events (30th bday goals, work/travel time, access to gyms, healthier eating) I went from 18% body fat to 6-8%. I have abs, muscle definition and look totally different. For comparison, I’ve never had a bicep or ab muscle until now. Essentially, I went through the ugly duckling experience much later in life. I suppose I was very comfortable in my previous state, sure…the likelihood that a ripped guy in the 8-10 range would look at me twice was approx. 0-5% depending on the light (Ha.). Now that I can play in the 8-9.5 range on a regular basis…well, it fucked up all concepts of gaming/socializing that I thought I had. There are a few things I’ve really noticed and had to put into perspective from my ugly duckling experience.

Straight guys: Straight guys that bat in the 8-10 range check out other guys, constantly. This is so disturbing to me, at first I was excited that maybe these guys were gay all along, but no, through many discussions, lots of gym time and straighbro friends it is clear to me that straight guys are almost always sizing up other guys. I 100% think they double take on any muscle definition for self-comparison. My response to this fact initially was to become totally awkward, did I have snot hanging out of my nose? Was he judging how thin my hair is getting? As you imagine, the negative thoughts could be never-ending. I now respond to this with a simple nod, slight smile type whatnot and don’t think about it anymore. Whatever insecurities the straight guys are sizing me up for can remain his own. It took this ugly duckling a while to figure out these straight guy glances, but, I’m glad I did because it is saving me lots of awkwardness these days.

Gaybros: I knew this before, but now experience it. I previously had no chance with gaybros in the 8-10 range, but now, and not mad about it, I can score a solid 8-9.5 in most settings. I generally find a 10 too intimidating, so no need to even play in that field. What I have learned is that these gaybros ARE NOT initially interested in anything but what is under your shirt. Everything beyond that is a bonus. It took me a while to figure this out and understand what the big deal is/was..if my face got me by in the 5-7/8 range, why will my body get the 9/10s? An important point here is that these guys are just as nice, fun and entertaining as guys I used to talk to. This threw me off at first, I expected them to be Adonis-disorder a**holes with no personality. But, thankfully that was an incorrect assumption. So, now that these 8-10 guys talk to me, what’s wrong with me still talking to the 5-8 range as prospective buds, hookups, etc? I learned that the 5-8 guys were just as much fun as I remember them being, but after several bad experiences, I knew that my taste in guys had changed as much as my own looks had changed. This is going to sound totally ridiculous, but those hot faces that I was always attracted to couldn’t overcome the sort of grossness or dislike I felt when a guy would take his shirt off and be overweight (by overweight I mean no discernable muscle definition). This is how I used to look, so I pass no judgment. Several experiences I came away with the same thought, even though it bothered me. The feel of body fat pressed against my muscles felt/feels really, really bad.   I by no means think that low body fat equals attractiveness, so this issue did bother me. But, I’ve had to accept that I feel different and other people now feel different to me, our bodies change over time, tightness of skin, definition, and tons of other factors play in to these feelings. I sum it up as follows: If you have a six pack, let’s talk some more to see if we are sexually compatible. If you don’t have a six pack, I’m not a dick by not flirting, I will talk to you and hope that we can be friends, but I’m saving you and me a lot of awkwardness by not sleeping with you. (Note: I’m not shallow six pack chaser; there are plenty of muscle-defined guys that don’t have six packs, probably more than the number of guys with six packs. But, the lack of muscle definition is my point). Thus, if I am interested in sleeping with a guy I now implement the rule of nothing matters initially but what is under the guy’s shirt. It’s sort of the gatekeeper in the 8-10 range.

Gaybars/saunas/gym/etc and touching: I live in and have lived in several crowded cities…public transportation, elevators, terribly close restaurant tables, etc., I’m used to it. Random touching, passing by, or otherwise having limited personal space is common to me. But, never before have I had someone touch me in a sexual way in which the experience was not mutual, or even potentially mutual. Granted, if these touches were coming from someone I was attracted to it would be a totally different experience. But, it is all too common for me to meet a random acquaintance of friends, friends of friends or random strangers in which there is no expectation of hooking up, but almost every time I’m in one of these settings someone will take the opportunity to rub their hand down my stomach, grab my arm, or some other touch/grab. It makes me feel completely gross. I would NEVER rub my hand down this person’s stomach and grab a handful of whatever is pouching out over his belt, it would make him feel bad and I wouldn’t enjoy it, but yet some random person is completely comfortable grabbing me? This was incredibly uncomfortable to me at first, in the sense of being sexually objectified and, well, an experience I did not want to have. Granted, I’m no prude and enjoy being social more often than I should, but these types of micro-aggressive sexual advances are not acceptable to me. If I wanted this person to touch me, in my mind, they would know it. Thus, now I am quick to brush off any of these touches and perfectly happy to give a WTF? look that makes it clear a boundary has been crossed. It took me a year of feeling shitty from several experiences to realize this. 

I fully recognize that this post seems narcissistic. I promise I’m not, but this ugly duckling experience is real and exposed me to some very real challenges. I’d like to know what other gaybros have done / experienced in their ugly duckling transition!

If you don’t have a six pack, I’m not a dick by not flirting, I will talk to you and hope that we can be friends, but I’m saving you and me a lot of awkwardness by not sleeping with you. (Note: I’m not shallow six pack chaser; there are plenty of muscle-defined guys that don’t have six packs, probably more than the number of guys with six packs. But, the lack of muscle definition is my point). Thus, if I am interested in sleeping with a guy I now implement the rule of nothing matters initially but what is under the guy’s shirt. It’s sort of the gatekeeper in the 8-10 range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gaybars/saunas/gym/etc and touching: I live in and have lived in several crowded cities…public transportation, elevators, terribly close restaurant tables, etc., I’m used to it. Random touching, passing by, or otherwise having limited personal space is common to me. But, never before have I had someone touch me in a sexual way in which the experience was not mutual, or even potentially mutual. Granted, if these touches were coming from someone I was attracted to it would be a totally different experience. But, it is all too common for me to meet a random acquaintance of friends, friends of friends or random strangers in which there is no expectation of hooking up, but almost every time I’m in one of these settings someone will take the opportunity to rub their hand down my stomach, grab my arm, or some other touch/grab. It makes me feel completely gross. I would NEVER rub my hand down this person’s stomach and grab a handful of whatever is pouching out over his belt, it would make him feel bad and I wouldn’t enjoy it, but yet some random person is completely comfortable grabbing me? This was incredibly uncomfortable to me at first, in the sense of being sexually objectified and, well, an experience I did not want to have. Granted, I’m no prude and enjoy being social more often than I should, but these types of micro-aggressive sexual advances are not acceptable to me. If I wanted this person to touch me, in my mind, they would know it. Thus, now I am quick to brush off any of these touches and perfectly happy to give a WTF? look that makes it clear a boundary has been crossed. It took me a year of feeling shitty from several experiences to realize this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fully recognize that this post seems narcissistic. I promise I’m not, but this ugly duckling experience is real and exposed me to some very real challenges. I’d like to know what other gaybros have done / experienced in their ugly duckling transition!&lt;/p&gt;

We both have seriously discussed getting married.  

I'm out to most of my family but haven't come out to my very conservative grandmother yet.  I've been putting it off as long as possible, because even though I expected she'd probably be ok with it, it's still going to be an awkward situation.

I talked this over with my mom, and she agreed we better tell her so she gets ""used to"" the idea that I have a serious boyfriend, especially now that we live together and will probably start going to holidays/family events together more often.

I told her with my mom, and she had a range of emotions.  First it was ""What do you mean you're gay?  You're not gay!""  And I assured her I am, and then she kept saying ""It's like I don't even know you anymore!""  I kept telling her I'm the same person, and the only difference is who I love.  The conversation ended with her saying, ""You're not gay.  You don't act like one of the gays.  This is just a phase."" etc. etc.  My mom and I agreed she didn't take it *awesomely* but she's still in shock and needs some time to adjust.

Since then, it's been a downhill slope.  She's called my mom three times now, bawling her eyes out and saying, ""What did we do wrong?  What happened to that boy?""  She refuses to understand no one ""made"" this - it was just the way I was born.  She told my mom she's been crying herself to sleep at night.

A few times now she's just started crying when I'm around or talking to her.  She still says ""I love you"" and kisses me hello/goodbye and stuff, but it's breaking my heart to see her, because I can tell it's eating her up inside.  I straight up told her (paraphrased) that she means a lot to me, I love her very much, and that it's no one's ""fault"" I'm gay.  It's who I am, and it doesn't change the kind of person I am.

Long time follower, but I recently had to change my username because of I didn't know how to internet a few years ago...  Anyways....

Ill keep the specific area and bar name private just because they didn't ask me to come here.  New Years Eve I attended a New Year party at a gay bar in Southwest Louisiana.  My boyfriend was working the door and I was hanging out in the area.  The owners of the bar came in.  The actual owner of the bar is up in age and has health issues, so his partner Gary is making all the business decisions.  My boyfriend introduced me to Gary.  Gary told me I was cute and asked where I was from and what I did.  I told him I graduated with a degree in Advertising and Media focusing on Branding building, Advertisements, and Social Media.  So he said that he was looking for someone to help with the bar.  Since the area is the bar is in is slowly getting a vibrant younger gay crowd, they are more into going to the clubs instead of a small cruising bars.  They are gradually loosing money because people are ""pre-gaming"" at their bar, then leaving to go to the clubs.  The stroke of midnight comes and the bar goes from roughly 70 people to about 20.  Drag shows are twice a month and once they are over, the crowd leaves.

Gary asked me if I knew of any way to keep the younger crowd here, even if its just for that one extra drink.  So this is where I come to you...

1) Do you guys frequent gay clubs more or gay bars more?  Why?

2) What is something this bar could offer to you personally that would make you choose to stay longer, or choose to leave another location to come to this bar?

Im not expecting to solve all the problems in this post, but right now, I need a little more insight from other GayBros to at least get started and maybe even start a think tank group with a few of you to help!  Anything is appreciated!

I'm 23 and came out about a year ago, it was the first time I'd seen him in a while, and he'd only found out a few weeks ago (I did wonder if this is more than a coincidence).

It was a boozy evening that went on until about 5 or 6 in the morning, and my friend was quite drunk and said he wanted to go to bed, so I dumped him in my bed as he lived too far to get back by bus. I stayed downstairs till the bitter end, came back up an hour later.

Well you can see where this is going... Before I knew it he was kissing me, and I went along with it. I guess I had always maybe fancied him a bit, and he's always been one of those guys that you might think was at least heteroflexible. Always was a bit touchy feely with guys, and in fact had tried to kiss me once when we were much younger and I batted him off because I was scared. But I didn't think too much of it at the time, thought it was just drunk fooling around. He always had a girlfriend and they seemed to have a normal sex life, indeed he made a very strong pass at my best friend at the party - she thought he was nice but wasn't interested.

In fact, two of my female housemates assumed he was gay (not sure why, he's not really camp or anything) until I corrected them. 

Well things progressed very quickly, I was sucking him off, and he wanted me to fuck him, I said ""are you sure"" etc. and could't quite believe what was happening - but well I was also drunk and horny and wasn't going to say no! We both topped and bottomed and then went to sleep, it was actually great. Really great. Perhaps too great - I did wonder whether he'd done this before, it seemed a little too good to be true, though he's never discussed anything like it with me.

I think it's probably fine. We didn't really discuss it in the morning though it wasn't especially awkward either. He texted me asking me to keep it between us, and I said that of course I would, and then I asked him whether he wanted to talk about it. He said not to worry, everything was fine and that he just sometimes did crazy things when he was drunk - to which I replied, don't we all!

I trust him not to be the kind to make it really awkward, and will probably see him in a few weeks for his birthday so we'll see. I don't want to force anything, his sexuality is his issue. I sort of think he's a very horny bisexual guy who's not ready to admit that yet, and that's his business. I don't get especially easily attached and am fine with casual sex, so I don't see myself suddenly falling for him or anything like that. 

But it's still a slightly weird situation and I did want to vent a bit and ask a couple of questions - 

Did I take advantage of him? He clearly wanted to at the time but perhaps I should have been more sensible and said I didn't think it was a good idea. I was particularly taken aback that he wanted to bottom first and I feel like if he was exploring this side of himself, this probably wasn't the best context. I don't even really know how much he enjoyed it, but he didn't tell me to stop even though I said he should say if he wasn't enjoying it.

Have any of you had things like this happen? How did it work out? Were you able to get on with life and chalk it up as a fun but probably unwise drunken indiscretion not to be repeated? Or did it permanently mar your friendship?

He texted me asking me to keep it between us, and I said that of course I would, and then I asked him whether he wanted to talk about it. He said not to worry, everything was fine and that he just sometimes did crazy things when he was drunk - to which I replied, don&amp;#39;t we all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I trust him not to be the kind to make it really awkward, and will probably see him in a few weeks for his birthday so we&amp;#39;ll see. I don&amp;#39;t want to force anything, his sexuality is his issue. I sort of think he&amp;#39;s a very horny bisexual guy who&amp;#39;s not ready to admit that yet, and that&amp;#39;s his business. I don&amp;#39;t get especially easily attached and am fine with casual sex, so I don&amp;#39;t see myself suddenly falling for him or anything like that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s still a slightly weird situation and I did want to vent a bit and ask a couple of questions - &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did I take advantage of him? He clearly wanted to at the time but perhaps I should have been more sensible and said I didn&amp;#39;t think it was a good idea. I was particularly taken aback that he wanted to bottom first and I feel like if he was exploring this side of himself, this probably wasn&amp;#39;t the best context. I don&amp;#39;t even really know how much he enjoyed it, but he didn&amp;#39;t tell me to stop even though I said he should say if he wasn&amp;#39;t enjoying it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have any of you had things like this happen? How did it work out? Were you able to get on with life and chalk it up as a fun but probably unwise drunken indiscretion not to be repeated? Or did it permanently mar your friendship?&lt;/p&gt;

I've never cuddled with anyone before. I don't have a social life, and I didn't know what I did not have. I used to tell myself that I was ""alone, but not lonely."" However, it turns out that I am starved for intimacy. We talked, and I turned quiet after a while. When he asked me what I was thinking, I told him that I felt like we were like an old couple. This was someone I had only met one time prior. Looking back on it now, I realize that the word I was looking for was ""content."" For the first time ever, I was content to be with someone. I've experienced contentment on my own, but this was the first time I experienced contentment in the company of another. 

He was very nice and made it clear that while he was looking for a relationship in future, I should not be offended if he went on other dates. I told him that I too would be wary of someone who expected a monopoly on my time after just one date, and that it was fine. I wish I could go back and delete that ""old couple"" comment. But what's done is done. 

I don't know how to handle this. All my life prior to now suddenly seems lacking because I did not share it with another person. And now I know I'm lonely, I don't want to be lonely anymore. I worry that my obvious loneliness will make me desperate and drive guys away. 

God, my life used to be so simple. 

**EDIT:** Some things might not be coming across properly in this post. I'm fine if nothing serious develops with him. I just don't like this newfound awareness of my loneliness.
