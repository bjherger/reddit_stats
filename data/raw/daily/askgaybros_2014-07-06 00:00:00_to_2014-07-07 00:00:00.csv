I'm a long time reader, but first time poster.  The reason I'm posting now is basically because I don't have a lot of people in my life to go to for advice like this... so here I am!

So back in April, I met a guy via Tinder (of course) and we hooked up the first weekend we started talking.  But after the hookup, we continued talking a lot and hanging out.  I live about 70 miles from him, but I would go and visit when I could. When we were together, it was great. I met all of his friends, everyone seemed to like me, I liked everyone else. We would meet up for extended weekends, of course have sex, go out, lounge around, whatever.  But when I would go home, it would be a little bit of a different story. Communication was almost nonexistent. I felt like if I did not text him to say hi every once in a while, we would go days or more without any communication. This kind of led me to believe that he didn't see whatever we had as anything very serious.  So I tried to approach it as such.  I didn't set my expectations too high. I tried to go into it with the approach of having fun, but not setting myself up to be hurt down the road.

The problem was that we never had a talk about what we were or what we both wanted. I just made assumptions about what he thought it was, and I guess he did the same about what I thought.

Fast forward to last weekend (Pride weekend).  I spent all day with his friends on Sunday.  But like halfway through the day, he started acting extremely weird and would not talk to me and acted like I was getting on his nerves.  I was drunk (like everyone else), but I didn't think I was being obnoxious, but regardless, I gave him his space and I kind of kept my distance.  That night, I went to a bar with him and his friends.  I had been drinking all day.  I was fairly intoxicated and still kind of pissed off at him for not talking to me.  I started talking to this other guy at the bar.  I proceeded to get very drunk.  I then made out with said guy at the bar.  I didn't think Tinder guy saw me, but he did.  He didn't say anything to me that night. But 2 days later, he texted me saying ""After this weekend, I think it's best if we don't hang out anymore.  Wish you the best.""  Then silence.

I, of course, sent him a few texts begging him to talk to me and explaining how I felt.  No response.  I then sent him an email laying all of my feelings out.  Finally, a day later, he sends a text.  Basically he says ""We never had a talk about what we were, but I think we both knew we were more than just friends.  When I saw you making out with someone at the bar, it caught me off guard and made me rethink everything.""  That is the last communication he has had with me.  I have texted him asking him to just talk to me about it, I asked him to get coffee with me, etc.  No response.

The fact that he was thinking we had something serious was the last thing that I was expecting.  He has shown no indication of this being the case. Regardless of whether we were serious or casual, making out with the guy at the bar was of course stupid.  Since this has happened I have been a mess.  I can't function throughout the day without thinking about him and about what I did.  I'm embarrassed, mad at myself, and sad that he won't even talk to me about it.

Is there anything I can do to try to convince him that I'm sorry and to just get him to talk to me about what happened?

Here are some of the anxieties/depressive thoughts that go through my mind, crippling me from taking the next step:

- I don't have anything to offer in terms of being sexy, so it's hard for me to feel sexy enough to be the object of someone's pleasure. I have an average size penis (5.5, not thick), my skin is covered in hundreds of large moles, I'm inexperienced at sex, so I'm not going to be sexy in the moment (I don't know how to be 'vocal' in a sexy way, don't know how to do things to maximize a guy's pleasure, etc.), and the list goes on. No one is going to be like ""I love your dick"" and want to suck it. When they look at/feel my skin, they'll notice all of the disgusting moles and be grossed out.
- I get nervous about if they'll still like me with my clothes off. Again, the moles. I wonder if my butt will be too hairy for their liking, if my legs are too hairy.
- Being a bottom, I get extremely nervous about being perfectly clean down there. What if I haven't pooped recently? If I haven't I'll sit on the toilet trying to force myself because I can't do anal unless I've emptied it out. It just feels like bottoming takes SO much prep work that it's almost not even worth it ever (but I still want to do it mentally).
- If it's just for oral, again my size makes me depressed (they won't enjoy giving me head). The penis is such a central point of sexual encounters that I can't just ignore the fact that mine isn't something that guys will be lusting for.

So I am a 22 year old male college graduate who is starting professional school in the fall. For about two and a half years I have watched predominantly gay porn when having some alone time. But about 6 months ago I made a grinder account and hooked up with someone who actually cared enough to be gentle and slow with me. 

The problem is we ended up exchanging phone numbers and my mother saw some of the texts. (They weren't nsfw, but I changed his name to the female version in my phone)

She eventually confronted me about who this person was, she looked through my phone, and eventually to make her happy I broke contact with him since I live at home and will have to for the next three years. 

Recently I have hooked up twice and have come to terms with being either gay or bi (I've had girlfriends but sex with only one) but I talked to her agin and she told me I was confusing myself some I haven't had a girlfriend for a long time. 

But now I've met someone who I actually would like to get to know more, as a potential boyfriend, but he is uncomfortable dating someone who is not out. I like him a lot but our communication is also being strained since we have to kik instead of just text or whatever. 

I'm worried about everything and it's having a mental effect on me, I just haven't felt that happy and whenever someone brings up dating I feel a little down about myself. Especially since my mom said that my stepdad (who I'm very close with) can't stand gay people, and I've heard him say some slight negative comments. 

Ideally I planned on not coming out until I finished school and moved out, but that's at least 3 years. 

Can you guys help me? What should I do? ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry in advance for any errors, I&amp;#39;m on my phone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I am a 22 year old male college graduate who is starting professional school in the fall. For about two and a half years I have watched predominantly gay porn when having some alone time. But about 6 months ago I made a grinder account and hooked up with someone who actually cared enough to be gentle and slow with me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is we ended up exchanging phone numbers and my mother saw some of the texts. (They weren&amp;#39;t nsfw, but I changed his name to the female version in my phone)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She eventually confronted me about who this person was, she looked through my phone, and eventually to make her happy I broke contact with him since I live at home and will have to for the next three years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I have hooked up twice and have come to terms with being either gay or bi (I&amp;#39;ve had girlfriends but sex with only one) but I talked to her agin and she told me I was confusing myself some I haven&amp;#39;t had a girlfriend for a long time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now I&amp;#39;ve met someone who I actually would like to get to know more, as a potential boyfriend, but he is uncomfortable dating someone who is not out. I like him a lot but our communication is also being strained since we have to kik instead of just text or whatever. &lt;/p&gt;

With nothing to distract myself, I got into thinking mode and reminded of this guy I could have gone out with and here's the story.

It was my physics class last year, there was this hot guy who caught my eye but I didn't act on it because I pretty much just thought he's just another hot straight guy and I have never been a functioning human being who knows how to start a conversation. Eventually we started talking when it's practical/experimental time in the class and I got to know him better. What I remember the most about this guy is that one night, after getting out the class, we talked on the way to our cars and when we got there (my car was close to his), the guy just took off his shirt to change to his bartender t-shirt right next to his car, and I was like 0.o and didn't do anything but just drove my way out of the parking lot and kept saying ""God damnit!"". A few weeks later, I was the only one student who did well in the first exam and the guy approached me personally asking for tutoring. With me never tutoring anyone in my life and a few other reasons such as it would be such a hassle to meet up at one place and it would be also very distracting for me to focus because of his handsome face and muscular arms so I declined and told him that I couldn't but I would do the homework that the professor gave us and write in details of how to solve the problems and give it to him the week after to study on it. Surprisingly, he accepted that and asked if there was anything he could do to compensate, I said nothing because I would do the homework anyway and it just took a little more effort to write down the explanation for him. The guy still insisted and said he'd do anything: taking me out for dinner, taking me to a shooting range, recommendation for a part-time job, basically, anything. Still, I didn't want anything from him so he just kept on reminding me about his offer. However, the week after came and he suddenly decided to drop the class. I wasn't falling for him or anything but I did regret not trying harder to get to know and help the guy and especially, I regretted not accepting that dinner offer. It's not a boyfriend I wanted him to be but I could have got myself a friend (which I haven't had any since my sophomore year of highschool) if I had tried getting out of my comfort zone.

I'm posting this from a throwaway account for obvious reasons.

A little background, I'm mostly a top and gradually getting more and more dominant in the bedroom.  I have recently met a guy and we're getting on nicely.  He's really into being 'used' and 'abused' and in generally pretty keen to be my sub/slave.  

I don't have too much experience in the whole sub/dom, master/slave scene and I want to learn to be a less awkward master/dom - mostly because I'm inexperienced I guess.  My confidence is growing, however, and I think if I had some more tips and advice I could really get into it.

So, any other master/doms out there have any tips or hints or advice for someone just starting out?  Any slaves/subs out there want to chime in with some good advice too?

**TL;DR** (and I don't blame you, because I ramble quite a bit): I'm uncertain of career prospects and I feel shitty about this because I don't want to be wasting more time out of my life without actively furthering it in a meaningful way. I'm mostly interested in health sciences, but I'm also very good with hard numbers and financial concepts. Advice or simply personal experiences would be appreciated.

So my question is: what do you guys do, is it what you planned to do and how did you get there? How did you make these decisions after leaving school and before starting your career? Are there any useful resources / subreddits out there for just this kind of post?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So for a bit of context, I'm 18 and am currently on a (completely uneventful and perhaps wasteful) gap year after high school and before uni. I got a pretty good final mark (ATAR of 92.65) I was mostly happy with, and got into the course I was 'after' by a large margin. So next year I'm off to Melbourne to do a Bachelor of Science at Monash Uni. 

Problem is, I'm not sure at all what I want to do with my life. And I know, I know, I'm still young and most people don't know for sure either and early plans almost never work out as they're intended. But still. I'm the type of person the obsesses over details and am generally well-founded in my views. But in this utterly huge area, I'm pulling a blank. I picked a Bachelor of Science because I'm interested in health sciences primarily, because it was easily achievable for me and because it was a general degree with lots of room for maneuvering. But it's so hard to know what comes after, and what the options are - and as the person who plans a heap, I am not at all enthused by the notion of making it up as I go along, or seeing what's out there after I finish - especially considering I'll be moving to to Melbourne from my current town, which is by no means an easy or cheap option. And I've already wasted a year doing nothing, so I can't really 'afford' to push back my career much more, if you know what I mean.

The second problem is that (I've heard) such general degrees aren't really highly valued in an of themselves, and that I'd either _need_ to do Masters or Postgrad work to even be considered for the lowliest of jobs in the science field. Which provides even more variability and indecision. I was planning on switching courses to Biomedical Science as soon as possible (missed the prereqs for it in high school), which is sacrificing diversity for a more useful degree (I think).

I was originally thinking I could aim for Medicine - but it's an incredibly high-level course (naturally) that is hard to get into even if you _have_ all the necessary pre-requisites (which I didn't). At best it would take me 7 to 8 years to get through Undergrad and Postgrad study, and considering how uncertain I am, I don't know if I want to devote such a significant amount of time, energy and money into it. And that's not even considering the amount of time it'd take to specialise. Also, being a shy person with social anxiety, I'm not sure it's the best career path for me. A lecturer at Melbourne Uni (who I thought to be quite an asshole, really) made the point specifically for people like me to not even consider Medicine or Medical Research (which I was also considering). As much as I hated such a broad and absolute statement from someone who seemed to be lacking in the social skill department himself, it didn't exactly do wonders for my self-confidence.

I was also mildly considering a tangential health science like radiography or something - mainly because the course was short and there was a clinic in my town that offered very generous incentives for prospective interns. But I'm pretty sure that consideration was only being made because it was an easy way out of a hard decision.

It's just frustrating to have all this information available (yet little of the actual pathway information I need) and all these options in front of me, only to have made very little progress in my deliberations over the past 6 months. 

Thanks in advance.

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just frustrating to have all this information available (yet little of the actual pathway information I need) and all these options in front of me, only to have made very little progress in my deliberations over the past 6 months. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

There's drug addiction, prostitution, smoking, gang-banging, and being sexually active without protection. Yet all of these don't cause parents to disown their children instantly, but having same sex attractions and simple same-sex relationships (without sex) cause it.

Why?

Is it that they want all children when grown to marry, have sex, and have babies?

Are there any other lifestyles that are actually worse than being gay that I'm not aware of?

I don't know if this is a common thing or not, but that's why I've turned to you guys for answers. 

Before I get to my question I figured I'd say that I've dated and had sex with women, but not with men.

I find women to be very attractive. I'm just attracted to the feminine physique. On the other hand, I'm not particularly attracted to the male physique. I do find some men attractive, but I just done like the body of most men. 

Now for the question. Even though I don't really find most me. Attractive, the idea of having sex with a man (especially bottoming for a man) is incredibly arousing. I don't find the male body arousing, but the sexual organs are another thing altogether. My question is, is this fairly common to your knowledge? Pretty rare? Am I a freak of nature, or is this just something that some people deal with?

I'm open for questions and comments, but I am just on a break at work, so I won't be able to answer questions for 5 or so hours, unless I get a slow time of day.

I'm a bro. I hunt, I fish, I prefer whiskey. Most straight guys who're uncomfortable with gay people seem to befriend me. I take pride in that. I help people better understand the world around them and shatter stereotypes. 

With this comes some guys who randomly get comfortable enough to experiment. It's never bothered me before, helping someone figure or how to better define themselves. I'm not predatory. In fact I think that using my perceptivity and others confort in me constitutes taking advantage of someone. I refuse to make the first move. I refuse to go along with any sexual acrivity until I'm sure they know what their doing. 

I have a straight best friend and roommate.  Now, I've been really close with him for about 5 years. I call him my brother. I love him, and am sorta in love with him but know that it's inappropriate so I don't ever let that cross my mind. I recoil at the thought that I'd lose him as my friend and keep my feelings restrained and distant. Anywho, we've randomly joked about me liking him and I've been honest when I've told him I'll only ever allow myself to be his friend, no matter what. If he came out I'd help him find a boyfriend lol. But I think I broke that promise the other night.

Two nights ago after sharing a six pack we went to bed. Having just relocated from across the country we're sharing a bed since we couldn't bring much furniture with us. I woke up to him holding me. Cuddling. I readjusted my position and his breathing changed. He had one arm around my shoulders and with his free arm he unbuttoned his jeans. I noticed some pressure on my shoulders and he moved the hand towards my neck pushing towards his groin. 

I left my inhibition behind and went with it. His cock was rock hard, covered in precum, and he moved me towards it. I ended up giving him head. He was gasping and grabbed the sides of my head to regulate my rhythm before crying out as he came. 

The next morning he didn't say anything. Me, wanting to make sure he was fine waited on him to make his own decisions about what had happened. Two days later and he still hasn't said anything. He's acting completely normal. I'm the only one a bit uncomfortable now. 

Should I talk to him and force a convo about it? Should I leave it alone? Should I just try and forget it even though that seems impossible? I'm more confused than I think any of the previous men I've been with probably were. Help. Please help.

Tl:dr my straight best friend got head from me one night and I'm not sure whats going on.

Edit: I think he doesn't remember through the haze of sleep and the light buzz he may have had considering he only drank 3-5 beers... that makes it worse. 


FINAL EDIT: UPDATE! We talked. I couldn't sleep and he got up to ise the bathroom so I just said ""We need to talk..."" he said when he woke up je thought he just had an erotic dream and didn't think anything of it. He wasn't mad. He said he needed to process it and 20 minutes later said it was cool. We were both drunk and it happened. He apologized that I struggled and he reminded me that we're friends, I should feel comfortable telling him anything. He said it was our secret. I left it at that. He'll process and either it'll happen again or it won't.  Either way we're good.

So, if you hook up with guys online: 1) What are red flags that should tell you that you should NOT meet this person? 2) If you meet up with guys you've never met in real space before, what precautions do you take? 3) What strategies would you use or have you used to get out of uncomfortable situations? 

For me, if there was any indication that a guy was into barebacking or crystal meth, that was a no-go. I also have a good instinct for recognizing when someone seems mentally unbalanced--not sure how to turn that into advice, though. 

When I had a roommate (gay), we had an understanding that I would leave any contact information about the person I was going to meet on my desk (name, address, phone number) just in case. I'd also observe standard bar protocols, i.e., don't drink anything you didn't open, etc...

Only in one instance did I genuinely feel threatened. It was when a guy tried to coerce me into a bondage/domination scene, and my gut instinct was to get the hell out of there. He tried to keep me there by hiding my glasses that I needed to drive. He had a nice house and nice stuff, so I grabbed an expensive lamp and told him that I was going to start by smashing it and was going to keep breaking things unless he gave me my glasses back immediately. He complied, and I got out. Of course, I'm 5'11"" and 180lbs., so I probably don't seem like an easy target for physical intimidation.
