I'll do my best to keep things logical, but it might get confusing trying to follow my wacky mind.

Just recently, I've started to come to terms with being pretty much gay (26 y/o). I've come out to two friends, but still unsure when/how to come out to my family. I'm starting to come out of my shell, but have some mental blocks that I am trying to sort through.

On Saturday, I met a guy, I'll call him G, from online (he's 50). We met about a year ago and just recently started chatting again. When we met, we started talking about expectations and he opened up about his feelings for me. He also opened up about how he wants to have a relationship, but understands needing to take it slow for my sake. He also understands that it may never progress to a relationship. He's very caring and I could tell he'd be a great boyfriend.

Now here's the kicker, I have been wanting to meet someone with the possibility of it becoming a relationship. However, I wasn't expecting to have that deep conversation with G. While I do find him attractive, I have a slew of doubts and mental blocks.

First, the age difference is kind of a factor for me. I feel guilty for having such a selfish and superficial doubt, but this is the biggest resounding issue I am battling with. I brought that up to G, but he mentioned the age difference should not be a factor and that he's dated guys his age, older, and younger. He also mentioned it should be about the connection, not the number of years separating us. This confuses me to no end.

Second, if I do start dating G, I would essentially be lying to my family about my personal activities and ""study"" habits. Don't get me wrong, I do spend quite a bit of time studying at the library, but it would be a huge issue if they found out I had a boyfriend without being out to them and lying about my whereabouts. I already have a questionable past with my parents, so I don't want to disappoint them any more or put either of us in a difficult and painful situation.

Last, but not least, I am not sure I really can handle a relationship. I know I mentioned I want one, but actually being in one is a whole different ballgame. When G and I talked, I mentioned that I'm scared. I'm scared of lying to my family. I'm scared of getting hurt. I'm scared of hurting him. Scared of how to handle school, work, and a relationship. I'm just...scared.

Okay, I'm sure I've rambled needlessly. I don't know if I just need a swift kick in the rear or the help of a therapist. I turn to you bros because the community has seemed to be very helpful, understanding, and accepting of most difficult situations anyone faces. Any advice would be great.

He has super sensitive nipples and I can almost get him off just from licking them. Anyways, so we were messing around and I was kissing his chest and then I saw it. Not gonna lie, it was a shock and totally pulled me out of the moment. I literally stopped what I was doing, sat up, and turned on a light to get a better look.

So it's about an inch directly below his ""regular"" left nipple. It looks just like his other nipples. While the other two are super sensitive, he says that touching the third one is actually kind of painful (he describes it as the same sensation of digging your finger deep into your belly button).

He said that he's always been really self-conscious about it and he never takes his shirt off in public because of it. I still find him sexy as hell in general, but tbh, whenever I do see it, it pulls me out of the moment briefly and is kind of a turn-off. But the moment is short and I can get back into.

I told him that I don't care about it or think any differently and that I still find him very attractive (which I do). I'm afraid to say anything to him about it because I know he is so self-conscious about it.

I guess I don't know what my question is for you guys, I just wanted to get that off my chest and hear your thoughts.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I was fooling around with my boyfriend a couple weeks ago and got his shirt off.

I'll try to keep it succinct since I know long posts can get tedious. 

First and foremost I have come to realize in the years after coming out that I am not a nice person. I am capable of *being* nice when I feel like it but, overall, I have a tendency to be downright wicked when I feel like I've been used or taken advantage of. 

Normally people equate being mean to being unhappy but I don't feel unhappy. I have melancholy days like anyone but in the grand scheme of things I feel like my life is going well. I think my jadedness comes from a myriad of bad experiences with men that I can't seem to shake. 

I know I'm not alone in having been on shitty dates, having men disappear, lose interest, act really disrespectful etc. but unlike other people I feel like each of those experiences pushes me further and further into myself to the point where I am almost always on guard around men even when it doesn't seem like I am. 

I no longer trust most of what men say and, given my natural ability to read people coupled with my now ever present alertness, I find I can sense their motivations easily 9/10. I can tell when a guy is feeding me lines and I find it insulting that they don't think people can pick up on it or perhaps they don't care. 

I get that most men in their 20s aren't really ready to settle down and they have a fear of missing out but I've never really been able to understand that either. I've heard all the sex-positive reasons people give for engaging in the hookup culture but I can't separate that behavior as being inexplicably linked to low self-esteem, lack of willpower (in terms of not being able to say no to your sexual urges even when you should) and insecurity. 

I'm sure there are people out there who are able to hookup with others without feeling guilty about it after but I find the fact that they're usually unwilling to analyze why they chose to do it to be telling. 

Despite getting offers (which have become much more frequent as I've gotten older and shaped myself into the type of person I want to be) I've never been able to engage in any of them because I know I'd feel absolutely disgusting afterwards. I can't have sex with a man knowing it's not going to lead anywhere. 

I need to know he's emotionally invested before I lay down so that if he decides to disappear or pull some other dick move I know he'll hurt a little at least. I dislike that I feel this way and I recognize and am aware of all the negative feelings I have like this and where they come from thanks to my near constant introspection. 

I suppose what I'm writing to seek insight on is how to learn to let go of all of this. I never would have imagined when I was a bright eyed 16 year old first stepping out of the closet that I would ever end up so jaded and vengeful and yet I am. 

I can turn them off on occasion when I feel comfortable with a man but it's rare and I'm never truly surprised when the ax falls. I'm sure reading this makes it sound like I'd be an absolute nightmare to date or spend time with but I'm actually quite ""normal"" and keep these thoughts mostly to myself. 

I dated my last boyfriend for a year and a half and we never argued or had any major problems beyond the fact that he struggled with substance abuse. I'm very good at putting my best foot forward and making sure the face I show the world is the one I want them to see. I've never been physically violent or dangerous, just in case anyone is wondering, I just keep myself on a very short emotional leash these days and it's wearing on me. 

It's almost as if I can feel my heart hardening and it's scary. When my ex and I separated he cried, threw himself into rebounds and did all the self-destructive, sad things people usually do when they're heart-sore. I cried for roughly 3 minutes the very first time I went to pick up my stuff, have had no rebounds (just dates that go nowhere) and have thrown the rest of my energy into my upcoming move for graduate school and making sure everything is taken care of on that front.

Part of me would love to take the next attractive man who's interested in bedding me up on his offer but I know I'd hate myself afterward. It's a control thing and I despise feeling vulnerable to anyone. I'd rather be sexless. 

I'd like to find a way to relax and let life just *happen* as it's meant too instead of constantly trying to control it and keep myself safe from getting hurt. At least if I got hurt I'd feel something as opposed to not feeling anything at all when it comes to men. 

This is the most personal post I've ever done and will likely ever do. If you wanna call me out in the comments go for it, since it'd likely be justified. I just want more insight.

I've had one idea, but I wanted to see what the popular consensus is. My son has asked me 3 times already this year if he could get his ears pierced, and each time I said no.
