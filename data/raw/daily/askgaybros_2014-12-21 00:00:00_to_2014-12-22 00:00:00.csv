now some signs that I've seen, when we talk we have like super long conversations, sometimes we glare at each other for a while, and whenever he goes on a break he almost always comes to my area and talk to me.

the only thing that makes me have doubts is that i don't know if hes gay, we're friends on facebook and that's it. i don't know what he does for fun that much (that is for like outdoors life) and, i'm also not out. he also gives of this impression that hes into women but i doesn't seem real. he only once gave me that impression.

&lt;p&gt;i want to know if this guy is into me. basically i just turned 19 and this guy i work with is 26. anyways, it was a long time ago when i first noticed him. but as soon as i did, i knew i wanted to get to know this guy. hes super hot and doesn&amp;#39;t even act like he&amp;#39;s 26. so i got to know him and learned a little bit more about him. we have the same interests, and almost the same types of anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;now some signs that I&amp;#39;ve seen, when we talk we have like super long conversations, sometimes we glare at each other for a while, and whenever he goes on a break he almost always comes to my area and talk to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the only thing that makes me have doubts is that i don&amp;#39;t know if hes gay, we&amp;#39;re friends on facebook and that&amp;#39;s it. i don&amp;#39;t know what he does for fun that much (that is for like outdoors life) and, i&amp;#39;m also not out. he also gives of this impression that hes into women but i doesn&amp;#39;t seem real. he only once gave me that impression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so please, what do you bros think?&lt;/p&gt;

Here is a link to my original post: http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/2p39lp/advice_question_for_my_gay_brothers/

tl;dr my best friend and I have been experimenting with each other, and I am a bit confused (sorry thats a terrible tldr, but Im not good at simplifying)

Anyways, the biggest feedback I got from last time is that I should let my friend sort himself out- that I should stop mentioning things to him and asking him to masturbate together, and that I should let him come to me with such requests.

Well, this advice worked AMAZINGLY (at first). Ironically, about 3 days after I posted, he called me and was talking about getting a fleshlight for himself. I told him I thought they didnt work so well, etc, but he insisted he wanted to get one since hes been thinking about doing so for a while. After we hung up, he texts me asking if I had ever used one, I said no, he asks if Id like to try it with him when I visit next, I say yeah that sounds fun, and he says we should help each other out and try to do so as much as we can during the one night we have alone before another friend (who is also visiting) arrives. At this point Im ecstatic. I think that he is finally more comfortable with doing that stuff with me, and that it might even lead to something more. 

It gets better, we keep talking that night about how horny we are, and we basically text each other as we are jacking off- as in ""what are you watching"" ""nothing really is good tonight"" ""just finished the first time, gonna go for 2"" ""man that fleshlight is gonna feel good"" ""haha im getting a boner just thinking about it"" ""wow that felt awesome, just finished again"", etc etc. Stuff that I have DEFINITELY never heard from a friend. The talk progresses, and it gets to be a bit of a contest about who can finish the most. We go to bed. 

The next day, we get back to the contest talk- the previous night it was a joke, but today it gets a bit more serious. I don't mean to sound biased or something, but it was like we were flirting- playfully goading each other into this contest. Then we decide we are going to bet on who can finish twice the quickest. I (remembering what you all said) say that there is no way to prove that we are finishing, its a silly idea. He says we could skype (hesitently) as denoted by saying ""we could skype, but eh"". We get back to talking about the bet, and he insists that I choose something (all I can think of is sexual stuff and I dont want to say it for fear of pressuring him). I tell him to help me out deciding, and he says ""im horny, I wont judge anything you come up with, go ahead and say something"". ""okay, whats your limit then, just so I dont say something off the wall"" I say. ""youre my best friend, whatever"" he replies. At this point, im excited and say screw it- ""winner gets a bj?"" ""sure"". I make it clear that it would be a trial thing and either of us could say no (neither of us has ever given a bj before). Then I ask if he's sure he doesnt want to skype tonight. he says maybe, if I want to. I say itd be fun, but if he needs to get up early we should skip it. Then I ask if the bet we made applies to this competition or the one when I visit. He says ""how about both"" as in 2 bjs. 

Now, Id much rather him give me a BJ, so I make sure to win. We skype and masturbate together while watching straight porn (as far as I know). I can only speak for myself but I was definitely watching him and the porn. As I said, I finish, and he almost seems embarrassed or something. He hangs up on skype after a minute and says that he couldnt finish under pressure. Then he says that he didnt really like skyping and he doesnt want to do it again. In all honesty, I didnt really like it either- it was impersonal and felt like I was doing it with a random guy on the internet, but I DEFINITELY would not have said anything about it. I certainly wouldnt mind doing it again.

So this was the high for me. Im feeling great- thinking that finally there might be something here. Flash forward to today. I feel a bit bad about the bet, so I tell him that if we want to try bjs, it should be mutual like everything else we do, that I dont want him to feel like we arent in the same boat. Later today he texts me saying he agrees, but that he is ""kinda meh on it overall now"" (btw I have no idea if he meant BJs or the entire night we had planned). Then he quickly changes the subject (I guess) to work. As in, he sends me the text about being meh about the whole thing followed by two other quick texts about how hard work was today. I take this as a signal that he doesnt want to talk about it.

So my question is this. Firstly, what the heck? I feel like he is jerking me around a bit (as some of you have said he is) and I cant tell if he really wants to do this stuff with me and is repressed or if he really is just a horny guy (never heard of a horny guy offering a bj to someone...). Not to mention that we jerked off at least 5 times over 2 days, so i dont see how he is still ""horny"". Secondly, I really want to send him something to the effect of ""hey, what changed your mind?"" to call him out and make him talk a bit, but, at the same time, I'm really worried that this is pressuring him. Also, for those of you that dont know, I told him over the summer that I was developing feelings for him, and I dont really want to open that conversation up again unless Im sure that he has feelings too. Would this be an appropriate question? Am I justified in asking it?

Thank you all so much- and for those of you wondering, this is a throwaway account because Im really not 100% comfortable with my own sexuality yet, and this whole thing is causing me a ridiculous amount of confusion and frustration. Thanks again, as I said before, I really do value you guys' input on this stuff.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all, Im back because I got great feedback from you all last time, and Im really hoping that I can get some more advice.

Today, he contacts my mom saying he wants to come over and hang out with her and then asks if I&amp;#39;ll be there. Drama follows him everywhere he goes and I&amp;#39;m 100% sure he&amp;#39;s going to confront me about being gay/on Grindr. Just need some insight and guidance on what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

I've never been romantically/emotionally attracted to a man nor do I desire to have sex with a man.  Whereas the opposite is true with women.

With that said, when I'm horny/fapping I enjoy seeing attractive, muscular, and masculine men.  I find straight porn so much hotter if the guy has a nice body and I pay attention to his pleasure as much as the girl's.  I've also recently started watching male solo masturbation vids.  I am not into gay porn, though.

I don't have a problem with this but for whatever reason I felt the need to post here and get it off my chest.  I just think there's something inherently sexy about a really defined male physique.  Does this make me bi?  Is this a gateway to male-male experiences in real life?
