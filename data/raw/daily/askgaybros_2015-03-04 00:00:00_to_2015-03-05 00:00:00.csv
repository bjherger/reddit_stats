This is my first post on reddit. I have decided to ask you for opinions
because i see that many of you are much more experienced in this than me. 5 years ago
i have had an very painful experience of having mad crush on my best straight 
friend. I have tried to hide it at first but after some period i decided to tell him.

He reacted very badly, ignoring it at first like he couldn't process that atm, and later
he was torn between disgust of his bff having a gay crush on him (my country is a bit conservative, 
and he comes from conservative background) and possibility of losing only person he can confide in
(i was his shoulder to cry on). He decided to have me around, and this status quo lasted for almost
a year. Once while drunk, we almost started making out, but it was stopped by his parents coming home.
I couldn't be his friend anymore, so i have decided to finish that weird relationship we had, because 
he had a GF that he was in love with, and she made him both miserable and happy at the same time, and
i was both jealous of her and torn to see him suffer, that i started getting really confused about what
is happening.

After ending that ""thing"", i was really hurt, but my friends helped me to get out of it. I haven't 
had a crush since then and every other relationship was purely sexual. I realized then that i still
haven't gotten over him.

Now, a month ago, he suddenly enters in my life. He finished his painful relationship with his GF, 
and he is trying to leave impression like something has changed. I felt like im relapsing to old feelings
i have suppressed. We haven't talked about what happened when we stopped talking, but he is trying to
convince me that he is a different person now (what ever that means).

Im pretty confused right now, because i have tried to let him go but he is back, after i have explicitly
told him i will always have difficulties being friend with him. 

Can you draw from you past experiences and hint about possible outcomes of situations like this?

So, I realized that I was bi last fall and have now finally come around to the idea of exploring the gay dating scene. So, I switched my ""looking for"" status to both men and women on Tinder. Within a day, I had around 30 matches (many more than I could ever hope for with the womenfolk). It felt like every time I swiped right on a dude, it was a match, which was pretty surprising and different.

However, there are a few things about me that I imagine would be huge turn-offs for many guys...

1) I'm bi. I know this alone can be a dealbreaker for women and men alike.

2) I'm still closeted for the time being. Like I said, I just realized this about myself fairly recently. My best friend (and now some random dudes on Tinder, lol) is the only one who knows. I wouldn't really mind coming out but I don't see what benefit that has for me at the time being, and it's definitely going to be a while before any family hears about it.

3) I'm a virgin with very little experience sexually. It's a religious thing. It's not that I haven't had the opportunity (I consider myself to be at least decently attractive), but I've always turned away sex offers to keep my promise to God. I'm not sure I want to wait until marriage anymore given that I'd like to give sex with both men and women a go, but I know that no matter the circumstances, many people won't date virgins.

4) This sort of goes right along with #3, but I'm obviously not looking for quick hook-ups or anything very sexual early on.

So yeah, it kind of seems like I'm the perfect storm.

My question is, how and when do I break all this stuff to any potential guys I'm talking to? To me, it seems like the earlier I let them know, the better. That way there can be no misunderstandings and disappointment, and they can move on without any serious consequence. and little to no wasted time and effort. However, I don't want to destroy any chances I have by being *too* upfront too quickly, if that makes any sense.

What do you guys all think?

I will preface this by saying I am bisexual and this post may be more appropriate elsewhere but this was the best place I found to put it. And before anyone asks, I am definitely bisexual and not gay so please don’t try to convince me otherwise. 

Anyway I have this friend and we are both early 20s. I have known him for almost 5 years and never really got any vibe he might be into guys until pretty recently, but then thinking back there may have been signs. He is definitely the best friend I have had throughout college and probably my whole life but he doesn’t know I am bi since I haven’t told anyone. I like to keep my sex life private and it’s just easier to let people think I’m straight since I do in fact have sex with women. I spend almost every day with this friend and crash at his place all the time. In the first year I knew him he asked me once if I was gay but I brushed it off and convinced him I wasn’t (at the time I didn’t even know I was bi and hadn’t been with any guys). Our freshman year he didn’t really get along with other guys on the hall so he would come to my room a lot and we would get high and he would play his guitar (often shirtless and singing to me for some reason, not that I was complaining). I didn’t think much of it and he got a girlfriend sophomore year and we lived on different sides of campus so we hung out less and he was pretty wrapped up with his GF (whom he is still with now but in long-distance relationship). 

Things were pretty normal until senior year. He had always asked me about what porn sites I liked and I gave B.S. answers to get him off my back. But suddenly he started asking pretty frequently like he was expecting the answer to change, and not just about what sites I went to but also what kind of stuff I was into and this made me a little uncomfortable (by this time I knew I was bi and didn’t want to admit I watched a lot of gay and transsexual stuff). When we were hanging out and bored he would ask if I wanted to watch porn with him and I basically shut him down and told him I thought that was really creepy but he would still occasionally ask. Whenever we watched something together he would ask if he could lay in bed with me, which I didn’t think was too weird because it was a king and had plenty of room. But he would lie unnecessarily close to me and I had a comfortable chair in the room he could have used. He would also offer to let me lay in his bed at his place but I always said no because it was small and seemed a little weird. 

Then an incident happened when my roommate came back from winter break early while I was in the apartment having sex with a guy. I heard him come in and jumped to shut my bedroom door so he only saw me shirtless but he knew someone was in there with me. I snuck the guy out after my roommate went to his room so I have no way of confirming if he knew what I was doing because we never talked about it but if he did he probably would have told my friend. Since then my friend has progressively gotten more forward. He often walks around in only boxers around me. He goes to the bathroom with the door open, knowing that there is a huge mirror by the toilet and if I happen to be near the bathroom he asks me if I am looking at his dick. At the gym when he spots me at the bench he basically stands right over my face so I can see up his shorts and asks if am looking. He always wants to wrestle and he occasionally will kind of jokingly ask if I want to watch porn with him and masturbate together. A few times when I crashed at his place after getting drunk he asked if I wanted to sleep in the bed with him but I politely told him I am uncomfortable with that and it’s never going to happen (he sleeps in boxers). 
So I really can’t tell if he is hitting on me and has some suspicion that I am into guys or if he is just messing around like guys do and feels comfortable joking like this because he thinks I’m straight. The last few times we got drunk together he has wanted to talk about really personal stuff and has confided in my a lot, which is fine because we are best friends but it also seems like he is trying to coax something out of me like he knows I like guys. He has a long-distance GF he sees a couple times a month. So if he knows I’m bi, I don’t know if he is doing this stuff because he wants to hook up (since he has told me he cheated before with a girl) or if he is just trying to test my response and confirm any suspicions about my sexuality. I’ve been thinking recently I should just tell him I’m bi since it’s a little ridiculous I haven’t yet given how close we are. But I don’t want him to change around me or respond negatively and I sure as hell don’t want to have sex with him because he is like a brother to me and I don’t think of him sexually at all, even though he has an incredible body. So basically I don’t know what to do because it seems I’m just S.O.L. and our relationship will change regardless of what I do unless I just continue to lie to him about this part of my life and pretend not to notice these things he is doing. Any advice would be appreciated.

But suddenly he started asking pretty frequently like he was expecting the answer to change, and not just about what sites I went to but also what kind of stuff I was into and this made me a little uncomfortable (by this time I knew I was bi and didn’t want to admit I watched a lot of gay and transsexual stuff). When we were hanging out and bored he would ask if I wanted to watch porn with him and I basically shut him down and told him I thought that was really creepy but he would still occasionally ask. Whenever we watched something together he would ask if he could lay in bed with me, which I didn’t think was too weird because it was a king and had plenty of room. But he would lie unnecessarily close to me and I had a comfortable chair in the room he could have used. He would also offer to let me lay in his bed at his place but I always said no because it was small and seemed a little weird. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then an incident happened when my roommate came back from winter break early while I was in the apartment having sex with a guy. I heard him come in and jumped to shut my bedroom door so he only saw me shirtless but he knew someone was in there with me. I snuck the guy out after my roommate went to his room so I have no way of confirming if he knew what I was doing because we never talked about it but if he did he probably would have told my friend. Since then my friend has progressively gotten more forward. He often walks around in only boxers around me. He goes to the bathroom with the door open, knowing that there is a huge mirror by the toilet and if I happen to be near the bathroom he asks me if I am looking at his dick. At the gym when he spots me at the bench he basically stands right over my face so I can see up his shorts and asks if am looking. He always wants to wrestle and he occasionally will kind of jokingly ask if I want to watch porn with him and masturbate together. A few times when I crashed at his place after getting drunk he asked if I wanted to sleep in the bed with him but I politely told him I am uncomfortable with that and it’s never going to happen (he sleeps in boxers). 
So I really can’t tell if he is hitting on me and has some suspicion that I am into guys or if he is just messing around like guys do and feels comfortable joking like this because he thinks I’m straight. The last few times we got drunk together he has wanted to talk about really personal stuff and has confided in my a lot, which is fine because we are best friends but it also seems like he is trying to coax something out of me like he knows I like guys. He has a long-distance GF he sees a couple times a month. So if he knows I’m bi, I don’t know if he is doing this stuff because he wants to hook up (since he has told me he cheated before with a girl) or if he is just trying to test my response and confirm any suspicions about my sexuality. I’ve been thinking recently I should just tell him I’m bi since it’s a little ridiculous I haven’t yet given how close we are. But I don’t want him to change around me or respond negatively and I sure as hell don’t want to have sex with him because he is like a brother to me and I don’t think of him sexually at all, even though he has an incredible body. So basically I don’t know what to do because it seems I’m just S.O.L. and our relationship will change regardless of what I do unless I just continue to lie to him about this part of my life and pretend not to notice these things he is doing. Any advice would be appreciated. &lt;/p&gt;

So, a week later, he finally messaged me back and apologized how he's been a mess. It's not that they got back together, it's more about him wallowing about it. So, I figured I'd give him another chance as friends, but clearly the whole leading on still continued. Giving the benefit of the doubt, you know.

Yesterday, he messaged me about how he's going to see his ex because he wanted to talk and I was curious what happened. I told him, don't make bad decisions and let me know what's up if he needs to talk. Apparently it did not go so well to the point he wanted to hook up with me, and was at a low point. He kept on saying things like:

&gt; I'll never be happy again.

...and so on. But before that, I saw him add one of my friends on Facebook and they're apparently talking. My friend also apparently got out of a relationship too.

I thought to myself, just do it and make him come to me so I can face him and express my issues with him. Just to let it all out of my chest. I know I might be luring him for nothing, but I hope he'll understand. So we went for a drive again and just talked about it and I saw him texting my friend. I didn't want to be nosy about it, but I called him out on flirting with everyone. He admitted to it, to my surprise. I just told him not to hurt my friend. He accused me of *you're gonna tell him bad things about me*, but why would I? That's none of my concern anyways, they're both adults and whatever they do is their choice. 

I told him how he was flirted with me to the point where it led me on and let everything out of my chest. I really didn't want to make him feel bad, considering how he's emotionally vulnerable already. But I needed to do that — for me. 

He asked me why I didn't do it through text, but I thought to myself as someone with a bit more standards to uphold, I want to be able to say things to him face to face. He tried to sweet talk me, hug me, but I pushed away. 

Until he said:

&gt; I like you, but you're just not my type.

That stung, a little bit. Actually maybe *a lot*. Maybe because everything happened in my head. But because I feel stupid for not seeing through it. The signs were there, you guys pointed it out.

Bottomline, I didn't wanna show myself as weak and he wanted to drive me back home, *but I walked out of his car with my dignity, walked back home sobbing.

I have a very difficult decision to make, and I don't even know how to start. I was in a relationship with my ex (46M) for 3 years, and about 2 months ago he finally broke up with me after deliberating for 2 months prior, because we live 800km apart. I'm 20 years old, and I started dating him when I was 17 (1st year of university). After the first year, he had to move away because he lost his job and there was no work for him here. I couldn't move away with him because I'm enrolled in (Hons) Forensic Chemistry, and there are only 4 or 5 universities in Canada offering Forensic Science programs. Even though I positively knew that I loved him, I asked him if he wanted to break up because of the distance and he told me that he wanted to stay together. So for the next 2 years, I was only able to see him twice a year for maybe 1-2 weeks at a time (due to cost and my schedule). In November, around my birthday, he told me that he was considering breaking up with me because of the distance. He finally broke up with me in January. I still loved him, but while he was deliberating I told him to do what he thinks is best for him, since I was 100% willing to deal with the distance. I even gave it more than a month after we broke up in case he changed his mind, and to try and start the healing process.

A few weeks ago, I started seeing someone else (25M). I used to have sex with him in the past before I met my boyfriend, and that's exactly what we did again twice. But this Friday we had planned to slow down and go on an actual date for once. I know for a fact that he has strong feelings for me, and I have strong feelings for him as well.

This is the part that's really fucky. Tonight, maybe 2 hours ago, my ex sent me a message telling me that he really regrets his decision. I asked him if he wanted to talk about it and he told me that he is madly in love with me and that he broke up with me because he was afraid. Knowing him, he was literally afraid of falling for another man because I was his first real relationship with a man - and he's closeted to everyone but his closest friend who is a military psychiatrist (and in my opinion, a bad one at that but that's another story). At this point I was very honest with him, and I told him that I tried giving him as much time as I possibly could so that he could decide what he wanted, and that there came a time when it was time for me to start healing once he had made his decision and during that time I started seeing a guy exactly twice. Part of me feels like a horrible human being for this, but I honestly thought that it was over for good with my ex.

I'm sure that my brain is like soup right now. I'm not exactly sure what I'm looking for on here since it's going to have to be my decision, but basically with either choice I end up hurting someone and that is the *last* thing that I want to do. I almost forgot to mention.. My ex is planning on coming to visit me soon (which would easily cost $400). I am so scared because I don't know what to do at this point. I actually *have* to make a decision within the next month and basically I have to pick who I want to hurt, which is not fair because I don't want to hurt either of these beautiful guys ever....","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warning: possible wall of text. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a very difficult decision to make, and I don&amp;#39;t even know how to start. I was in a relationship with my ex (46M) for 3 years, and about 2 months ago he finally broke up with me after deliberating for 2 months prior, because we live 800km apart. I&amp;#39;m 20 years old, and I started dating him when I was 17 (1st year of university). After the first year, he had to move away because he lost his job and there was no work for him here. I couldn&amp;#39;t move away with him because I&amp;#39;m enrolled in (Hons) Forensic Chemistry, and there are only 4 or 5 universities in Canada offering Forensic Science programs. Even though I positively knew that I loved him, I asked him if he wanted to break up because of the distance and he told me that he wanted to stay together. So for the next 2 years, I was only able to see him twice a year for maybe 1-2 weeks at a time (due to cost and my schedule). In November, around my birthday, he told me that he was considering breaking up with me because of the distance. He finally broke up with me in January. I still loved him, but while he was deliberating I told him to do what he thinks is best for him, since I was 100% willing to deal with the distance. I even gave it more than a month after we broke up in case he changed his mind, and to try and start the healing process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, I started seeing someone else (25M). I used to have sex with him in the past before I met my boyfriend, and that&amp;#39;s exactly what we did again twice. But this Friday we had planned to slow down and go on an actual date for once. I know for a fact that he has strong feelings for me, and I have strong feelings for him as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the part that&amp;#39;s really fucky. Tonight, maybe 2 hours ago, my ex sent me a message telling me that he really regrets his decision. I asked him if he wanted to talk about it and he told me that he is madly in love with me and that he broke up with me because he was afraid. Knowing him, he was literally afraid of falling for another man because I was his first real relationship with a man - and he&amp;#39;s closeted to everyone but his closest friend who is a military psychiatrist (and in my opinion, a bad one at that but that&amp;#39;s another story).

I use the term 'boyfriend' very loosely because although we have been seeing each other for over a year and used to refer to each other as boyfriends, we have had arguments in the past that have put us in a bit of an ambiguous situation as of lately.


Anyways, when we first met a little over a year ago (I was 18, he was 20), I honestly thought he was perfect. We had so much in common, he was affectionate, he was funny, sexually compatible, etc. His passion also happens to be the hospitality industry. He went to a top culinary school, works at a renown restaurant owned by a famous chef, has an extensive resumé full of hospitality-related experiences and he wants to one day one his own restaurant. 


I personally love that he's ambitious and has a plan for his life. The problem is, however, that he doesn't really have a lot of free time to spend with me. He works a lot (50-60 hours per week). We probably see each other once a week, maybe twice if we're lucky, and for less than 24 hours each time. I have problems with depression and anxiety and it's nice to have someone around to cheer me up when I get lonely, but lately we haven't gotten to see much of each other. My birthday was last week and he spent about 6 hours (awake) with me that whole week. He took me out to dinner the night before my birthday, and slept over, but left early in the morning (why I said we really only spent about 6 hours together). That made me a bit upset because I thought he would have requested my birthday off from work, just like I did for his birthday, but frankly, I feel like he's so busy that had completely forgotten about it until he checked Facebook right before dinner. 


A few days ago he texted me saying that he felt as if we had grown apart, and he wishes he could do something about, but I don't see much for us to be able to do to fix this distance. He already lives about an hour away, and he oftentimes doesn't get out of work until 1 or 2 in the morning. Considering that we're both also full-time students, it's hard to coordinate time to spend together. Although I want to talk to him about this issue, his grandfather just died yesterday and I have no clue how/when to bring it up, although it probably won't be anytime soon. I have never lost a loved one, so I don't know how to comfort him, especially considering that he's in a completely different state right now and hardly wants to talk to me because he's grieving. 


Although I love him, and things were fantastic over the summer, I just don't know what to do. If circumstances were different, I could see myself being with this guy for a very very very long time, and he says the same to me. We've already planned and paid for multiple trips we're taking together later this year, and I just want us to be happy again by then. When I'm with him, I feel like I'm on cloud nine, but sometimes we end up arguing because he's tired and annoyed from having worked long hours, and wants no social interaction, but puts up with me because he misses me. I don't want to break up with him, but there are certain factors that I feel aren't being fulfilled and are taking a toll on me. For one, the distance and not being able to see him. Living an hour away is hard enough, I can't imagine what actual long-distance couples must go through. Next, is the sex. We have probably have had sex a total of about 5 times in the past three months. Like I said, I just turned 20. This is a problem for me, and whenever I try to bring it up, I just end up feeling like an ass or coming off as inconsiderate of the fact that he's tired/sleepy/annoyed, etc. Although I would never cheat on him, I can't help but feel like I'm missing out on fun times and getting to experiment (I've only ever had 2 sexual partners, while he's had 20+). Not to mention, just the fact that we care about one another, but can't be happy because of current circumstances.


I guess what I'm trying to say is: for people who are/have been in long-distance relationships or relationships where one partner is a lot busier than the other, how do you keep that initial spark going? Is it worth moving on if I really care about him, but feel like I'm limiting myself in some ways? Is it worth waiting things out until the summer when he'll have more free time and we'll be traveling all over together?


TL;DR: Boyfriend is too busy and we don't spend as much time as we would like together. We are growing apart and getting on each other's nerves because we are on different pages because our schedules don't add up. I am suffering from the lack of affection and sex, however, things will probably be fine once summertime comes along because he'll be less busy. Can't talk to him about problems right now because his grandfather died and he is grieving. What options do I have?

&lt;p&gt;My husband and I have always thought this could be a fun thing and we are willing to try it out. But I don&amp;#39;t want to get scammed. I would like to find a trustworthy site or method that we could use for some additional income.&lt;/p&gt;

I didn't have to work today so when he left for his office I stayed at his place and slept in. 

I woke up with a headache and looked in his night stand to see if he had advil. I found a bottle of STRIBILD that was recently prescribed to him. I did not know what the meds were for so I went about my day.

I got home a bit ago and remembered to look it up and it turns out it's medicine to treat HIV.

I don't even know where to begin. Bottom line is that I have been sleeping with this guy for the last eight months and we bareback all the time. I also ejaculate inside of him. He is probably undetectable but still, he should have told me about his status. To be honest, we never asked each other that question and I obviously assumed he was neg. I don't think I am infected, I got tested a few weeks back and was still neg. I also want to stay neg and stay wit my bf, but I don't know how to get past him not telling me about his status for this long. He knows I would not judge him for it, but I would have taken precautions to stay neg (read: PrEP)

I know I need to have this convo with him ASAP. But honestly right now I am still processing this fact and don't want to see him at all, much less reply to his texts. I know I am pushing him away but I feel sad and down about all of this. 

I love the guy, we have even traveled together abroad and shared many special moments together. I feel betrayed in a way but also understand he did not want to feel judged and stigmatized.

My little brother's gay, I'm not. It's cool for me  because he's my best friend, but my parents are rough about it. My brother came out a year before he entered high school. However, my parents sent him to different camps, different therapists, made him swallow different medicines, but nothing's ""working."" They were very disappointed. I tried my best to chill them out about everything, but they didn't even listen to me. From then, they kept on ostracizing my brother, and acted as if I was the only child they have. I felt bad about this, and I felt I'm partly responsible for not doing all the things I could have done to protect him. Then he started being rebellious. He started talking back to my parents, they always quarrel, and he'd get bruises everywhere. He started acting really weird, going to almost every parties, getting wasted and taking drugs. At this point I gave up, I tried every chance to talk to him but he closes his door to me, but the concern and love were always there. I got good grades, and he's failed them. Dad always told him he failed his grades for hooking up with random guys, or ""acting gay"" and all those stuff. He'd just stare and play the guitar, but I knew and felt the sadness and emptiness he felt. I wanted to hug him and to tell it's okay and I'll always support him, but everytime I walked in, he walked out. My parents always compared me to him, so that must answer why he hates me

Fast forward, university, my parents forced him to go to the same uni I was already studying in that time, in hopes he ""might just become like his older brother"". We moved into the same apartment but it felt like I was living alone. He doesn't talk to me, and doesn't even look at me. He hates me.

Fast forward a year, I confirmed he's hooking up with guys. Cool, no worries, fuck all you want. But I feel bad for all the guys he's playing with. He's become a monster I never expected for him to become something into. Then he's been hitting me, yelling at me, and cursing at me. I'm way bigger than him, but I refuse to fight back because I love my brother so much, so I just shut up.

One day he left his e-mail account logged in in his computer. I know it's rude to sneak, but I just wanted to know whether my brother's still safe or not. I was dumbfounded when I read series of e-mails about unsafe sex, breeding, barebacking, no condoms, and more. I talk to him about this but he hit me and told me to stay the fuck out of his business. I would feel bad if my buddy gets HIV or AIDS. I know it's treatable nowadays, but life is so much better if you haven't contracted any of those at all. I told him to stop hooking up with random guys, yet he accused me of homophobia.

How do I tell him to stop his unsafe sex trip that doesn't have to offend him in any way? More so, how can I get back my brother? I miss him so much, and there's no way I'll just sit back and let some wall build between us day by day. I want to tell him I love him so much and that I'll always support him no matter what. How can I get him to listen to me? How can I win him back? Is it rude to let him know that his unhealthy lifestyle is tearing us apart without putting the blame on his sexual orientation? I don't want him to think everything happened because he's gay, because it's not about being gay anymore.

When Sam first started he seemed very quiet and shy and no one really took any notice of him. I decided to go over and introduce myself and we started talking about different workouts and how often we train, he only does two sessions whereas I do three. I said that the other session is really good and that he should come to it to which he replied ""Oh I might have to then."" I didn't really think anything of it but then at the next session guess who showed up?


Not going to lie I was a little excited and we spoke some more and the conversation was pretty much the same as last time. I have an inkling that he might be gay too - he has certain mannerisms you know? I'm going to assume he's straight until proven otherwise though because I know how bad my gaydar is. I also feel like we kept making eye contact at times so maybe he's into me too?


So my question is really just how can I improve conversation and what would be the appropriate amount of time to wait before I ask him to hang out outside of the gym? Plus I have no idea what to do or where to go with him?

I can't really ask to do something right after the sessions either as they are during the evening and everyone goes straight home after.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey bros, so this new guy (let&amp;#39;s call him Sam) joined my gym recently and I was wondering how to get to know him more?&lt;/p&gt;

Alright, so I talked with him about two days ago and I didn't get the time to respond til now. 

We met up at a restaurant and enjoyed each other's company. About halfway through the meal, this is how the conversation went:

Me: Hey Otter, I'm confused about what happened the other night.

Him: What's up pup?

M: Well, I know from the start that you weren't looking for anything in particular, but the other day you said that you love me. When I tell someone I love you, it means I deeply care about this person and that this person makes me happy and I want to make him happy in return.

H: Pup, I don't understand what you're confused about. I don't just say I love you to anyone either. I feel the same. I care a lot for you and I love making you smile and laugh and being with you and making love with you. I meant what I said.

I enjoyed the rest of the date with him before we had to part. He texted me this "" I think you are adorable sweet sexy kind interesting sexy cute smart talented funny sexy a bit wild yet conservative polite appreciative respectful. Don't think too much about it Pup. I love you and I'm here for you."" 

I've come to realize a couple of things thanks to the responses. I know he's a busy guy because I've seen how crazy his work gets and know how far his family loves apart from eachother, but he makes time to spend it with me whenever he has it. And that's sweet of him. As for being exclusive, I'm not too sure. Stop over thinking. I'm just going to go with the flow of things. If something happens along our path, then it'll either be we'll be together or we won't.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/2xcw3w/he_said_he_loves_me_but_were_not_a_couple/""&gt;Original Post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

(Forgive me for this being so long!)


I have been successful in my educational career and have obtained a Master's degree. However, I always bottom out in my professional career because of my hatred towards self. My hatred leads to substance abuse, which has presented itself as a problem in my profession. As a result of my substance abuse issues, I’ve lost my professional job and had to move back in with my parents. I’m 25 and this is absolutely humiliating. And while my parents love me- they are very, very, very upset with me for being gay. They don't approve and have no idea how hard this is for me internally. (They sent me to gay-straight camp when I graduated with my undergrad in 2012).


Given these circumstances, I've learned that I will never be successful until I come to terms with who I am. As a result, I need to learn how to be comfortable in my own skin and accept myself as gay. This has proved easier said than done. Sure, I'll act out and have sex with men on occasion but I'm still not okay with being gay internally. I don't want my life to consist of one hook up after another to ease my hatred of myself. I really want to get to a place where I'm okay being gay. I really wish someone could teach me how to be gay and be okay.


-How did you learn to accept yourself? 

-How did you handle your religious convictions, if you had any? 

-Do you know of any literature on this topic that would be helpful in the coming out process.


I had been a part of an addiction recovery church group to manage my substance abuse issues. However, as I've started to vocalize my need for self-acceptance, I have been strongly urged against it. Upon sharing that I was watching pornography to feel better about my gay identity- I was kicked out. -Is it possible to be gay and also hold a strong faith in God? I feel so torn. I don't want to have to sacrifice my strong belief in God in order to feel okay in my own skin.


-Has anyone else had this struggle? 

-How did you handle it?


All of my old friends no longer live here and I fear I've run off many of my gay friends from college due to my continual struggle for acceptance. My church group has denied me, my parents don’t support my identity and I can’t seem to find another professional job. I am in serious need of a support network as my previous support has literally rejected me.


-So. . . other than attending bars and hooking up with guys, how did you form a gay social network? 

-Is that possible?


Sorry for being so long-winded. I just really want some help and I'm turning to reddit as a last ditch effort.

I'm always hungry for hard sex. Now, don't get me wrong. I do want to have sex with him but I don't want him to get hurt. If we'd go with vanilla sex, it's never going to be enjoyable for both of us.
