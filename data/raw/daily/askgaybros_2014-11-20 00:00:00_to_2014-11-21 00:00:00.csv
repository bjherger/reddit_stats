I'm gonna be trying my first m2m experience and long story short, the main plan we've sorted out is to give each other blow jobs.

Until recently I've considered myself 100% straight, but now I know this guy and I'm sexually attracted to him. Neither of us has any interest in a romantic relationship, but we wanna try some experimenting.

Being completely new to this, I was just wondering first and foremost if there are any risks involved with this and how to avoid them. 

Second thing is are there any tips on how to give a good blow job, that will be pleasurable for him and pleasant for me. 

I don't know why, or if this even happens, but I have this weird image of him hitting my gag reflex and me throwing up all over his dick.

My name is Ben and I'm 22 years old. I moved from my home state of Missouri about 5 years ago to attend college. Right now I reside in Wyoming (far away from home). My dad and I have maintained a very good relationship for the most part. Things were always rocky when I lived there, but now that I'm successful(ish) and independent, we seem to get along very well. But there is one thing that I never had the nerve to tell my father - I'm gay. Even as I'm writing this, my stomach is doing flips at the thought of telling my father. Why? When I was in high school in a very small town, there was only one other gay kid. We were pretty tight (we've messed around a bit, but there was never any love interest). He was always very open about his sexuality, even though most of the school treated him horribly. One night, his father found pictures on his phone and absolutely freaked out. He was kicked out, and I believe that his father got physical (there were bruises on his sides, but he never admitted to it). A few days later, I was telling my father and step mother about what had happened and that I was worried about him. This seemed to be a very controversial subject, because it escalated into a very heated argument. They both hated the fact that I had a gay friend, and at some point my dad actually asked me if I was gay. I denied it, and from that point it was dropped. 
Moving on to my brothers,  I have known for a long time that they are incredibly homophobic. They have a gay uncle (we have different mothers), and my eldest brother told me that he hated his uncle so much that he would kill him if he ever came to town. This only pushed me further into the closet. There were a few people that I had placed misguided trust in and came out. Within a weeks time, the entire school was asking questions, and even harassing phone calls, with the unknown caller stating ""Your son is a faggot!"".  Again and again, I denied accusations. But I'm sure you can understand that, with small communities, word got to my brother. He asked me about it, and warned me that I needed to be completely honest. And again, I denied it. 

I'm 1000 miles away from them. I'm safe. I have a good life here, and I only keep going up from here. But there is one thing that eats at me whenever my dad calls. 

How do I tell him that I'm gay?

So I met a guy in my college calc class freshman year ( i was 18, think he was 21)... he was super smart, had a nice smile and we would spend most of the time attempting to flirt. On the day of the final exam he finally asked for my phone number, and to be honest i'm not sure how the conversation went but it left me feeling good.

I went back home for the summer and didn't really think much of it, he never called/texted. So, I went ahead and added him on Facebook, didn't send him a message or anything, we would like each other status' and all of that jazz.. So that spring semester i kind of started seeing some guys, and i decided that i would defriend this old flame on fb bc you know? this guy was kind of my ultimate crush, didn't really go anywhere and had no huge meaning to me as a friend.... and i like to keep a small circle

So anyway, he adds me again the next day which was kind of a bold move and i accept because i think, well maybe he will make a move or something. He starts sending me messages &amp; it kind of dies off again, comments on my photos with some flirty messages. and I'm feeling it but when i send him a message on fb he takes a long time to respond or doesn't.

Flash forward this year studying abroad and i was just like fuck it, I'm gonna ask this dude out, So while I'm abroad i get the balls to send him a message, asking him if he wants to grab a beer with me, and he's like yeah! 

So, here i am as a gay 21 year old and i haven't held out for him or anything.

We talked everyday after he left and we both expressed to each other how much we liked each other but given the situation (being in different states) we had to be realistic and not do long distance.

When I started studying here a couple of months ago, I quickly made friends with a guy who also happened to be gay. We both left our home towns coming to a bigger place where we didn't know anybody from before. So we quickly got really close and he is probably one of my closest friends. 

Naturally, I have no problem what so ever with him being gay - I'm a dedicated feminist and have within the political party in which I'm active tried to actualize many important LGBT issues about discrimination, human rights, etc. May not be relevant, just really trying to emphasize my non-homophobicness. 

Anyhow, I've been really open about his sexuality and actually told him that I really don't have a problem with it. Often we engage in typical guy-to-guy-talk about sex and stuff like that, and I treat him no different than I would treat a straight friend - talking about sexual preferences, engaging in the oh so ever typical stereotypical objectification of other people (women AND men of course), well, you know what I mean. 

So yeah, I'm treating this guy like a would treat any of my friends and I'm not letting his sexuality get in the way at all. Something happened a couple of days ago though which potentially may have ruined our friendship though. 

I invited him over for dinner (which we often share, both alone and with other friends) and after dinner, we felt tired but decided to watch a movie (which we've done before many times). By the way, he gave me a really long and pretty intimate hug when he arrived. It was longer and more intimate than I've ever been hugged a guy (including him) before. No biggie I thought and moved on with dinner. Anyhow, it all starts when he tells me in the middle of a conversation at the beginning of the movie, that he likes to have sex with his friends because he feels like it strengthens their friendship. Not a controversial statement at all (and not the first time he's said it), but I felt it was inappropriate because of the fact that I never would have said something like that to a female friend. I was quickly ashamed of feeling sort of uncomfortable by it since I wouldn't have had it been a straight friend. So I didn't really respond to it but just moved on with the movie. During the movie, all sorts of things happen: 
-At first, he starts like caressing my face and pointing out that my non-existent beard is starting to show. He does this for maybe 30 seconds and I felt like it was just too intrusive. 
-He then starts trying to feed me food. He held some cheese and pretty much shoved it in my face, wanting me to eat out of his hand, you know what I mean. The first time he did it, I took it from his hand and ate it. The second time he did it, I wasn't ready and accidentally ate it from his hand!
-He then continues to move closer and closer to me until our faces are just maybe 20 centimeters apart. I moved back slowly but surely, and he followed subtly but very noticeable. 
-He starting massaging my hair slowly and passionately, like I know I sometimes do with girls. 
-He keeps giving me compliments about my looks and personality. At first, it was nice, but then just got too much. 
-Just basically acting flirty.

Once the movie was over, he left and I sat there just choked really. I left town for my parent's place and text him when I got there and told him about how I felt and that I thought it was really just too much. At first, I had to in detail had to tell him which of his actions I found inappropriate, he then understood and said he was sorry and that it didn't mean anything. We met today again at my place with another friend and it was kind of awkward and it's obvious it's not like before. 

Okay so, what are you initial thoughts about what happened? Did I interpret his actions correctly? Did I respond correctly? How should I relate to everything regarding him in the future? I'm not sure I'm that comfortable being friends with him if I know that he also would like to have sex with me, whether in the context of a romantic relationship or a sort of friends-with-benefits-relationship? Am I being homophobic reacting this way? How can I decide how I want to go on with this friendship, should I? If I should, how do I make sure it's not awkward again? If I shouldn't, well why? 

Just help please give me some help with this gaybros. I'm a guy who feels strongly about things. When I get dumped, I cry a lot. When I get happy, I'm super excited: When I may have hurt a friend, I get really down. When I may be facing the end of a good friendship, I feel just plain awful. 

Thank you!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi, so, I&amp;#39;m a straight guy around 20 years old studying in a bigger city in Europe. When I started studying here a couple of months ago, I quickly made friends with a guy who also happened to be gay. We both left our home towns coming to a bigger place where we didn&amp;#39;t know anybody from before. So we quickly got really close and he is probably one of my closest friends. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally, I have no problem what so ever with him being gay - I&amp;#39;m a dedicated feminist and have within the political party in which I&amp;#39;m active tried to actualize many important LGBT issues about discrimination, human rights, etc. May not be relevant, just really trying to emphasize my non-homophobicness. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, I&amp;#39;ve been really open about his sexuality and actually told him that I really don&amp;#39;t have a problem with it. Often we engage in typical guy-to-guy-talk about sex and stuff like that, and I treat him no different than I would treat a straight friend - talking about sexual preferences, engaging in the oh so ever typical stereotypical objectification of other people (women AND men of course), well, you know what I mean. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah, I&amp;#39;m treating this guy like a would treat any of my friends and I&amp;#39;m not letting his sexuality get in the way at all. Something happened a couple of days ago though which potentially may have ruined our friendship though. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I invited him over for dinner (which we often share, both alone and with other friends) and after dinner, we felt tired but decided to watch a movie (which we&amp;#39;ve done before many times). By the way, he gave me a really long and pretty intimate hug when he arrived. It was longer and more intimate than I&amp;#39;ve ever been hugged a guy (including him) before. No biggie I thought and moved on with dinner. Anyhow, it all starts when he tells me in the middle of a conversation at the beginning of the movie, that he likes to have sex with his friends because he feels like it strengthens their friendship. Not a controversial statement at all (and not the first time he&amp;#39;s said it), but I felt it was inappropriate because of the fact that I never would have said something like that to a female friend. I was quickly ashamed of feeling sort of uncomfortable by it since I wouldn&amp;#39;t have had it been a straight friend. So I didn&amp;#39;t really respond to it but just moved on with the movie. During the movie, all sorts of things happen: 
-At first, he starts like caressing my face and pointing out that my non-existent beard is starting to show. He does this for maybe 30 seconds and I felt like it was just too intrusive. 
-He then starts trying to feed me food. He held some cheese and pretty much shoved it in my face, wanting me to eat out of his hand, you know what I mean. The first time he did it, I took it from his hand and ate it. The second time he did it, I wasn&amp;#39;t ready and accidentally ate it from his hand!
-He then continues to move closer and closer to me until our faces are just maybe 20 centimeters apart. I moved back slowly but surely, and he followed subtly but very noticeable. 
-He starting massaging my hair slowly and passionately, like I know I sometimes do with girls. 
-He keeps giving me compliments about my looks and personality. At first, it was nice, but then just got too much. 
-Just basically acting flirty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the movie was over, he left and I sat there just choked really. I left town for my parent&amp;#39;s place and text him when I got there and told him about how I felt and that I thought it was really just too much. At first, I had to in detail had to tell him which of his actions I found inappropriate, he then understood and said he was sorry and that it didn&amp;#39;t mean anything. We met today again at my place with another friend and it was kind of awkward and it&amp;#39;s obvious it&amp;#39;s not like before. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay so, what are you initial thoughts about what happened? Did I interpret his actions correctly? Did I respond correctly? How should I relate to everything regarding him in the future? I&amp;#39;m not sure I&amp;#39;m that comfortable being friends with him if I know that he also would like to have sex with me, whether in the context of a romantic relationship or a sort of friends-with-benefits-relationship? Am I being homophobic reacting this way? How can I decide how I want to go on with this friendship, should I? If I should, how do I make sure it&amp;#39;s not awkward again? If I shouldn&amp;#39;t, well why? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just help please give me some help with this gaybros. I&amp;#39;m a guy who feels strongly about things. When I get dumped, I cry a lot. When I get happy, I&amp;#39;m super excited: When I may have hurt a friend, I get really down. When I may be facing the end of a good friendship, I feel just plain awful. &lt;/p&gt;

lots of sexy time. naked fun but not actual sex. Wrote a song for me. Turns out he's actually pretty scared of sex. Want to have sex eventually but not yet. A about 2 weeks ago he said he was finally ready to have sex, but he was drunk and I didn't want our first time to be when he was drunk.

he said he was tired of feeling like our relationship wasn't legitimate unless we have sex. I reassured him that sex doesn't legitimize our relationship. Our feelings do that. I also told him I love him. Still, he finally wants to have sex but we still haven't gotten around to it. Mainly my choice. 

But I told him that what I'm tired of is not know what we are. Someone asked me if he was my boyfriend and I didn't know what to say. Still... he was just quiet.
