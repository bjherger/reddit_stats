I'm ready to do it and I'm tired of dealing with it. 

Second, has anyone had this done as an adult (I'm 35), and if so, what was the ballpark of the cost? (in the US)

For those curious as to why I'd want to do this, here's why:
I've had really tight foreskin growing up. I never stretched it out when I was younger, and just left it alone. This has let me figure out that I can hump the bed, pillow or whatever to jack off. I haven't used my hand to jack off in a decade or so. 

Whenever I meet someone, I'm afraid of their reaction when they see my cock. Instead of being freaked out, everyone seems intrigued or fascinated by it. I get things like ""I've never seen one like that before"" or ""Wow, that looks so cool."" But when guys try to suck me, I feel nothing, and if they try to pull the foreskin back, I have to stop them because it hurts. That's one of the main reasons I want to get rid of it.

Another is cleaning and care (and not to mention the god damn drippage that comes out 10 minutes after I pee).

I'm a 20 year old dude and got into a relationship two weeks ago and few days back my boyfriend broke up with me. This was my first ever relationship. 

We've known each other for over a year and we study at the same Uni but different courses. We meet now and then during parties and stuff and text each other fairly frequently. He asked me out on New Years and I agreed. On that day he asked me If I'll be his boyfriend, I agreed. 

One night we were texting each other and one thing led to another we ended up sexting. The next day he messaged me saying he wanted me to stop talking about sex to him, in his own words ""right now you know how my dick looks like rather than my favourite place to eat"" 

I was dumbfounded and told him how stupid that sounds to me and told him, to me sex is important just as much how having his favorite food at his favorite restaurant is important to him.

Then after awhile he said 'it feels more like lust rather than love so we better off on our own'. 

So my question to you bros, did I go overboard? Is talking about sex at early stage of a relationship is too bad? or was he overreacting?  ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi bros. I&amp;#39;m a 20 year old dude and got into a relationship two weeks ago and few days back my boyfriend broke up with me. This was my first ever relationship. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve known each other for over a year and we study at the same Uni but different courses. We meet now and then during parties and stuff and text each other fairly frequently. He asked me out on New Years and I agreed. On that day he asked me If I&amp;#39;ll be his boyfriend, I agreed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One night we were texting each other and one thing led to another we ended up sexting. The next day he messaged me saying he wanted me to stop talking about sex to him, in his own words &amp;quot;right now you know how my dick looks like rather than my favourite place to eat&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was dumbfounded and told him how stupid that sounds to me and told him, to me sex is important just as much how having his favorite food at his favorite restaurant is important to him.&lt;/p&gt;

I've lurked in your subreddits for years. You  may have seen me post a few times. I could use some relationship/sex/culture advice from some problems I've been having—mainly if my thoughts and actions are shallow. 

I guess the first problem is that I cannot seem to ""finish"" sex. This isn't just an orgasm thing. I often stop to think about things  (how I ended up in such a situation, my partner, etc.) which completely kills my mood.  Just tonight, I completely stopped with a guy because I found the situation uncomfortable. This is the second time I have done this. There have been times where I loved the other guy, but I had trouble getting off. I may get checked out for impotency, but I think this is a little more  psychological than that. Is this normal?

I think my second problem is that I am having trouble with ""gay culture"" if there is such a thing. This problem is the reason I'm posting on gaybros and not r/gay or something similar. If you have seen any of my previous posts, I mentioned that I left the Air Force just over a year ago. While the experience wasn't horrible, and I made some lifelong friends, I don't look back on my years in with much enthusiasm. I remember a lot of insults saying I was extremely effeminate, stupid, weak, or some other nonsense. I did try to ignore it and just do my job anyway. It's the military. Also, my AFSC is famous for heckling people. 

Getting out, I decided to move to NYC for college. I spent freshman year in Brooklyn. Now I commute from New Jersey to the city. For the most part I love it, but I feel extremely distant from other gay men here. To this day I still don't understand the masculine/feminine thing. I meet a lot of gay men here who insist they are masculine. They'll have really big muscles. Then hang out at Gym sportsbar. I'll meet them on Scruff. But to me they come off as effeminate. I mean that in the best way possible. I've met feminine guys who are badasses. There are also a lot of things I personally do that are stereotypically feminine. But these guys seem to be pretending to be something they're not. Is this just an nyc thing? Am I even justified in thinking this?

I think I'm also a little uncomfortable with being ""hot."" People keep insisting I'm extremely sexy, but I don't see myself as such. I feel like guys I'm just not attracted to throw themselves at me, and that the guys I am attracted to won't give me a second glance. I'm also really insecure with my looks and intelligence. I'll blow off a guy if I feel he's out of my league. Is this normal too? I know I can exercise more for my body issues, but a lot of that still feels shallow. I want to be the guy who does moderate exercise for health reasons, and not be the approval obsessed gym rat.

Thank you for listening to my rant. Really this is a rumination over a bad hookup. I met a guy over Scruff who seemed extremely hot from his photos, but was a total let down when I met him. I hate shallow people though, and strive to be a gentleman. I want to know if my thoughts and actions here are wrong and if I can work on myself.

TL;DR Is it shallow to view gay culture's (really nyc gay culture's) ideas of masculinity and femininity as opaque—coming from a military background? Are my problems with sex (ending the encounter based on discomfort/considering myself attractive) normal?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey gaybros.

I honestly just can't fucking get over him, I feel so shitty. We've been seeing eachotehr on and off the past 6 months and I've been going to therapy, and working out, and just bettering myself in hopes of showing him that I'm not as depressed as he feels.

I'm super depressed, and just have problems wtih a bunch of stuff in my life, financial, family, career....everything.

I'm just having a problem with being alone, I live near Toronto, but I'm still in the country, and theres no one here.

I dont know haha, I'm just having a huge fucking problem dealing with life right now, I just really don't wanna be alone anymore, but have such shitty confidence that I can't put myself out there.

I think I'm good looking, and sometimes I think I'm ugly than a dog's ass, my nose is slightly bent, andI can get acne sometimes.

http://www.realjock.com/tealsock

link to my lame ass dating profile. 

I just find everyone to be incredibly attractive, and I have partial skin problems, and am not the greatest looking guy. My self confidence fluctuates hourly almost.

Sometimes I look in the mirror and like it, most of the time I don't.

Anyway, all of this partially drove my boyfriend crazy and the fact I got jealous if I caught him looking at other guys profiles, and a bunch of shit.

I know it all seems like I'm being juvenile, and that life can be tougher, but I am pretty poor, make min wage, am 24, and just starting out figuring what school and education Im going to get(was severely depressed since I was 16-22). 

My dad has leukemia that seems to not be aggressive so it most likely won't kill him, my mother has a blood clot, my sister is 27 and pregnant with a second child and works at a coffee shop and is dating a 52 year old. 

So I do have reasons to be upset, I also get severe neck burn from shaving my neck so it's hard for me to keep a super clean look going.

All of this was just too overwhelming for my previous boyfriend, and I am just worried I'm never gonna be attractive or at least mentally healthy enough for anyone.

I have tons of confidence in my personality, cause I know I'm a great person, sometimes I just don't feel thats good enough.

Don't even think this is asking you guys anything, more just venting and asking what you guys think about my mess.

&lt;p&gt;I know it all seems like I&amp;#39;m being juvenile, and that life can be tougher, but I am pretty poor, make min wage, am 24, and just starting out figuring what school and education Im going to get(was severely depressed since I was 16-22). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My dad has leukemia that seems to not be aggressive so it most likely won&amp;#39;t kill him, my mother has a blood clot, my sister is 27 and pregnant with a second child and works at a coffee shop and is dating a 52 year old. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I do have reasons to be upset, I also get severe neck burn from shaving my neck so it&amp;#39;s hard for me to keep a super clean look going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this was just too overwhelming for my previous boyfriend, and I am just worried I&amp;#39;m never gonna be attractive or at least mentally healthy enough for anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have tons of confidence in my personality, cause I know I&amp;#39;m a great person, sometimes I just don&amp;#39;t feel thats good enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t even think this is asking you guys anything, more just venting and asking what you guys think about my mess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am I just a first world problem meme, or am I that dancing African toddler just trying to cope?&lt;/p&gt;

So, I did something really bad today. I got onto my boyfriend’s Ipad and discovered he had lied to me about attending a networking event and instead met some guy in a bar. 

Now before you pull out your pitchforks, I know getting onto someone’s device and reading their text messages is wrong. You don’t have to say it. I tried to have a serious conversation with him before I looked at the Ipad, but I could tell he was lying. I don’t know if any of the other guys here in long term relationships can back me up on this, but when you’ve lived in the same apartment with the same person for 6+ years you get pretty good at knowing when your partner is full of shit. You also get a good idea for what their pin number is (Protip: don’t use the same four numbers for literally everything in your life!)

Like I said, we’ve been in a relationship for 6+ years. We have the whole deal: a dog-child, spacious NYC apartment, small business partnerships (mainly self-publishing ebooks and art commissions) It’s been great recently. We’ve been having sex (although its seriously waned in the last year or so) both our jobs are going well, and everything’s been relatively normal. 

Except for this past Thursday. He told me he was going for a quick drink at a networking event after work. I’ve been to these kinds of events with him before, and they’re fun, so it didn’t seem like a big deal at all. 

When midnight rolled around I texted him asking what was up. He came back home and when I asked him what kept him so late he said something along the lines of “I got hung up drinking with a blogger I met through twitter”.

Okay, time out. This was a work night. This was a clear disruption of his normal routine, which is usually be home by seven or eight at the latest, have dinner, veg out for a bit, and go to bed. I was suspicious and questioned him about it. Who was this friend? What’s he blog about?  Is he gay? Did you guys go to a gay bar? Did anything happen? 

I questioned him repeatedly, clearly, and in a calm manner. Every answer was a resounding “no”. No, he’s straight. No, nothing happened we just talked about blogging. No, of COURSE he didn’t kiss me! (Yes, I asked that). 

Well, I let it go and went to bed. Last night we were supposed to meet up right after work to go to an event. My boyfriend was a good thirty minutes late. He gave some half-assed excuse about work that I didn’t believe at all. 

So, after another round of questioning, we went out, did the event, and it was fun. I woke up this morning and he left super early for more work (he works on the weekends). I’d been suspicious since Thursday so I broke and got into the ipad. 

Yup. He certainly had met up with someone off of Twitter. He’s some guy from out of town. They had been planning their rendezvous for some time – but the weird thing is that there was nothing at all sexual in any of their texts leading up to the meeting. It all seemed completely normal. 

Then I scrolled down to yesterday’s texts:

	“Your kissing was so good”.

My stomach dropped out. I was hoping that I was just crazy and obsessing about nothing. 

They talked about how much they had made out at the bar (at the bar! In public! So it must have been a gay bar…) and then sent each other cock pictures. My boyfriend invited him to suck his cock (where? I don’t know where. His work? The other guy’s hotel?) The other guy explained he was in a relationship too but definitely wanted to meet up at a bar again (probably for more kisses, just like that slut Jenny). 

Here’s the kicker- my boyfriend was planning to take THIS guy to the event we went to last night, but didn’t realize I had been invited too! So I don’t know what he thought when I texted as I was leaving work, operating under the assumption that we were going to go to the event together. 

There were a series of texts that night from 6pm to 9pm repeatedly asking where the event was taking place and what time he should be there. They all went unanswered. 

Now my mind is reeling out of control. There were work friends at this event. Cheating is one thing, but why is he inviting his Twitter hookup out to an event with work friends?? Do the people he works with know he’s cheating? Did I just spend a whole night in the middle of this weird cheating group conspiracy without knowing? If they didn’t know, what was his explanation going to be for having this rando guy there instead of his boyfriend of 6+ years?

So here’s what I’m going to do: he’s at work for another three hours or so. I’m planning on taking him out to dinner tonight, were I will calmly give him a chance to own up about this. We’ve had some fun yelling matches in our apartment and I don’t want to repeat that, so I think having this conversation in a semi-public place where he can’t freak out is the best idea. If he owns up to it and tells me the truth, I will forgive him. If we still want to continue a relationship together, we will have to talk about it. Does he want an open relationship? What is he not satisfied with? What can we change to make it better? He absolutely hates talking about his feelings, so I think getting anything out of him on that subject is going to be very hard work. 

If he continues to lie, lie, lie, then I’m out. It sucks because I’m in a job transition (full time to freelance) so money’s tight. And I’ll probably have to give up the dog, who I love. Not to mention the 6 years of my life spent developing a partnership that’s probably gonna completely melt down tonight… 

Sorry this has become a book. It feels a lot better to get this all out. 

The upside is that I’m in a position of power on the housing part, at least. I’m not on the lease and the NYC squatting laws make it so he can’t just throw me out on the street or have the police remove me. So I have plenty of time, if I choose to, to find a new place to live. The idea of living by myself terrifies me. The thought of being single in NYC terrifies me even more. I don’t know if I could even get by here without the support I get from him. But I know I can’t live in this web of lies anymore. 

What is he doing? Is he being safe? We’re not big on penetrative sex so I’m not too afraid of HIV (I’m still going to get tested, and I have been tested a few times in advance so let’s leave the “getting tested” lectures at the door too, please) but what about infections? HPV? Anything transmitted through kissing and blowjobs?

If he can’t be honest with me then he doesn’t deserve a relationship with me and he certainly doesn’t deserve to take away my health. NYC has just about one of the highest STD rates in the world. I’m just horrified about the possible implications. 

What should I do? What should I say? How do you get someone to tell you the truth if they are dead set on not telling you? Does he still love me? How could we have been together for so long if he never loved me? What happens to the dog? What happens to all the trips and travel we have planned? 

I’m going to update this post later tonight and let you guys know how this goes. And if anyone’s got a free room in NYC hit me up. I might need it. 

**TL;DR: Found out my boyfriend is cheating and I'm going to confront him at dinner tonight. Will update later.**

We were best friends throughout high school and literally did NOTHING.  No kissing, cuddling, anything.  Both of us were just really focused on school, and sex wasn't that big of a deal to us.  He actually remained a virgin throughout college and is still one now.  

I was dumb and tried to see if I wasn't gay.  I had a couple of experiences of thrusting my semi-hard penis into a few girls' vaginas (lol), apologizing that I couldn't get hard, and then talking and becoming their new best friend for a few hours.  I've never been with a guy though.

I'm a little more experienced than him because of this, and I feel weird having sex with him.  I don't want to hurt him because I really care about him.  I am attracted to him but don't really think about him when I'm horny.  Is it because he's inexperienced?  What should I do?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So my best friend and I are both gay.  We recently came out to each other.  He&amp;#39;s 21 and I&amp;#39;m 22.
