A few months ago this guy talked to me on Grindr with a photo from the internet. After a bit of prodding I got him to tell me who he was (he has a twin that I knew), and it was a guy I already vaguely knew. He tells me no one knows he's gay, that his brother doesn't even know etc. 
He was coming on to me and being sexual, but I wasn't interested so we quickly stopped talking (although he persisted).

Fast forward to yesterday, another guy talks to me. He asks if I'm from a certain town, I say I am. He tells me that I know him and long story short it's the other guy's brother.

In May 2012, I realized I was gay, but was part of a community that I didn't felt would accept this. Now, I have different friends and am part of a far more open-minded, generous, tolerant, loving community. I had originally planned to just go from fully closeted to fully public in one fell swoop, but this changed. I first came out to a friend this past August who was totally supportive. In late October, I told another friend who acted the same. I've told about 10 or 15 more people (including my dad and his girlfriend as well as our family therapist, who were all wonderful about it) since then, and they've all acted the same as well. Our friendships have only gotten stronger, if anything, since i told them, and i feel more like myself around them than ever before.

Yet despite this, I just can't bring myself to tell everyone that I want to tell. Why can't I do it? I denied being gay to myself for so long because of my homophobic background, but the friends I've told know the people I want to tell quite well and assure me they'll be fully supportive. Not even all my housemates know because I can't muster the strength to do this. Is it because I was exposed to so much homophobia when I was young and impressionable that I can't shake the shame? Am I afraid of rejection? I know I'm worrying about something of no consequence, yet whenever a moment arises that I could potentially come out, my heartbeat accelerates and I freeze the fuck up. I imagine irrational scenarios of negative reactions, especially from my housemates. I absolutely know that all my friends would support me, but I just can't fucking do it and I need that to change. If you have anything at all to say or do that can help me, please do. But don't just tell me to man up because that isn't the issue and it's just superficial and immature - I'm confident and stoic in all other aspects of my life, just somehow this one thing has me fucking shaking. And I worry it'll affect my job search (I'm young) even though my career field is known to be very accepting, open-minded, and non-discriminatory.

I'm being vague and dodgy in the description of my situation so as not to identify myself, which is in itself a testament of how stupidly unwilling I've been to come out. I imagine better advice would be offered if I were more specific, but fuck me for not truly realizing everything about myself (not just my sexual orientation) until August 2013 (so yeah, even more revelations after admitting to myself that I'm gay). Anyway apologies for the histrionics and the blatantly pathetic nature of this post but thank you for letting me vent and I'd love to hear any advice you have for me.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s another post about coming out (sorry in advance for the 10000th one on this subreddit).

I'm seeing someone new and just few hours ago he told me on the phone that he was married and he has a child. He explained why he got married and stuff, he got married because he couldn't come out as a gay man and kind of forced to marry a girl to escape his abusive father.

All I did while he explained this on the phone is saying ""yes, ok"". Then he said he understands if I don't wanna continue the thing we have, and how sorry he is not telling me early. I said ok I'll have to go now. Then I hung up.

Now I don't know how to feel, I'm genuinely shocked. I like what's going on between us and I like the guy very much. At the same time, I don't know how to feel since now I know he has a child.

I am 26 and for various reasons that I've been working on I am still a virgin. Long story short, I've been working on the reasons and met up with a nice guy who said he was only interested in cuddling ""platonically"". He was attractive enough and prob the only reason I was willing was because cuddling seemed so safe to me with no expectations...even if I was mad curious if he actually really did just want to cuddle.

So, i invite him over and we pick a movie and start cuddling and it's great. I am doing my best to not give up myself as a horny teenager that gets turned on by every little thing (I still do because of my inexperience I'm sure). Finally, movie finishes and we're talking and then start kissing and it goes from there.

I only kissed one other guy and it was on vacation this past summer at a gay bar. It came naturally to me and I enjoyed kissing him even if looking back the guy wasn't really attractive to me much at all. But this guy...I'm liking that I can now feel him up and he's not AMAZING, but he is cute, but I just didn't seem to feel all that much kissing him. I felt like I was having to think about what I was doing and it just wasn't going well...but no idea if he felt the same.

Anyway, we move the bedroom and continue kissing. I take off his pants and start sucking a bit on his dick through his underwear. I take it off and I feel horrible for saying it...but he was kinda small and idk it just didn't do much for me. I guess I was a little disappointed? I don't consider myself a size queen at all and maybe I just have bad expectations, but I think he was below 5 for sure.

Anyway I suck him a bit, but he doesn't really do much but then pulls me up to kiss him and then he takes my pants off. This is where I get worried because he started sucking me (although I really don't feel anything at all?) and jerking me but I can't stay hard. I am really worrying now and not understand how that is. I'm guessing he got the picture because he stops and comes back up and we just resume kissing.

I played around a bit more from that rolling around the bed, trying 69 a little bit and whatever. That usually got my at least a little hard again, but idk once his hand or mouth was involved and I wasn't doing anything I couldn't seem to be too enthused :(.

I ended up jerking him off at the end and then I used my own hand for me while he kissed me.

Guys, I'm really worried. What if I've watched too much porn and stuff and won't be able to get off except with my own hand and thoughts instead of what's actually going on in real life? I never have trouble getting off myself even several times a day. I am constantly horny...too horny really. But then I get a real guy and can't perform?

I'm trying to placate myself in that he didn't really communicate much or moan or anything which I think I'd love. Didn't seem too interested in blowing me or anything, but i just don't know if that's the reason or not.

he seemed like a nice enough guy, I liked his body mostly (except his dick :( ) and was turned on when cuddling and stuff but idk. grinding out bodies together or him using his hand or mouth did nothing for me. 

What do you guys think? Btw, this is a throwaway account in case you couldn't tell.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all, I&amp;#39;m sure you get a lot of these, but I need some advice or hopefully something to calm my nerves.&lt;/p&gt;

I've heard fleshlights are awesome, but a pain in the ass to clean regularly. Worth it?

A bigger dildo seems like it could be fun, but I feel like I want something more exciting, so I thought the prostate massager. Any thoughts on that?

I find comfort in this subreddit so I hope it's okay to take this here.

**Where I'm at religiously:** 

I consider myself a gay Christian. I believe in God, more especially in Jesus, and believe in the word in Jesus. Belivening in Jesus gives me a great deal of confort, especially since I suffer from depression and anxiety. I try and pray every night, and I believe that God has helped me stay alive up to this point (especially when I was contemplating suicide earlier in my life). I know this can sound like BS at times, but I feel like God has answered my prayers. When I first came out, I prayed to him to guide me in any direction to help me out. I stumbled upon this subreddit the next day. I'm lonely and I used to pray to God to give me a friend, especially one that I can connect with. Well, I just made a friend and we click, and have a lot of the same interests. I'm completely aware that this sounds like BS, but I believe it.

**Coming out is my mother:**

It's just my mom and I. Other family has either died (like my dad) or lives too far away. 
When I told her I like guys, she took it very hard. She cried, stated she has no family, and said I was going to hell. I tried to ignore it, and I've distanced myself from her a lot this past week. I can't be open to her. And financially, I'm unable to move out at the time.

So today, she sat by me on the couch, and asked me if I saw the music video to 'Take me to Church'. I havent, but she told me what it always about. I told her I thought it was sad, and it's wrong that happened in it. We then got into how society views gay people, and she said, ""Why do you think gays have their own community? Oh, it's becaue society has distanced their self from gay people? Well, what does that tell you? It's wrong and unnatural. It's wrong.""

She then mentioned the bible, and I reminded her that Jesus was the law and he didn't talk about any of that kind of stuff. She then said, ""it's still wrong and you know it. I bet you can't resite the 10 commandments, so quit trying to act like you know so much about the subject."" 

After having a small argument with her by telling her she was rude and she ws wrong for judging me, she said, ""I'm not judging you. It's just my view point. And if it's not such a big deal, then why don't you tell your grandparents? Why don't you tell other family?"" I told her it was none of their business, and then she said that I'm evil. 

I went to my room and I'm now in tears. This is the first time she's insulted me or my sexuality, and I don't know what to do. She doesn't want to be logical about anything. The only person I have left in my life is using God against me, and it's killing me. I feel worthless, and I've been thinking about suicide. No one would miss me, and it seems a lot easier.

&lt;p&gt;I went to my room and I&amp;#39;m now in tears. This is the first time she&amp;#39;s insulted me or my sexuality, and I don&amp;#39;t know what to do. She doesn&amp;#39;t want to be logical about anything. The only person I have left in my life is using God against me, and it&amp;#39;s killing me. I feel worthless, and I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about suicide. No one would miss me, and it seems a lot easier.&lt;/p&gt;

So, some months ago I hooked up with a guy. He wasn't a stranger, he works in a bar that my friends and I often go to, and we'd had more than a few chats. Anyway, at one point he asks me if I'd like to meet one day and fool around a bit. He's hot and a nice guy, so I say yes. He says he's got a boyfriend but they're in an open relationship. Cool. So we meet a few times until I have to leave for college.

Now, since I'm going back home in a few days, he asks me if I'd like to meet again and he also says it'd be fun to have a threesome with his boyfriend, and I reply I'm up for it. After a few minutes, he casually slips into the conversation: ""And, by the way, my boyfriend mustn't know we had sex.""

So, right now I don't feel great. I'm angry at him for not telling me what I was getting into, I'm angry at myself for possibly being a bit naive and I feel really bad for being ""the other guy"".

What should I do now? Should I confront him? Should I tell his boyfriend, whom I've never met? Is it, at least partially, my fault? Is this even cheating? Am I overreacting? I've never been in this kind of situation before and I'm really quite confused...","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry if this post is messy / not relevant for this subreddit, but I&amp;#39;m a bit confused and don&amp;#39;t really know what to do.&lt;/p&gt;
