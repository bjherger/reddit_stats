I'm hoping to get some advice on how I can handle this situation.

Preliminary info:
Me: 22/m, college senior;
Him: 25/m, CSR for insurance company

Long story short, this guy (Fred) and I have known each other since I was still in high school, for a total of almost 6 years. In that time, we have grown close and become best friends. During those first few years, there were a few times when we would be ""about to start dating officially"", then something would happen to cause this not to happen. (Typically, one of us started dating someone else.)

The past is the past. Fast forward to September, when he and I finally decide to become ""official."" It's been great so far; our relationship is really just an extension of our friendship. However, there is one flaw.

Fred and I are having trouble starting to get physical with each other. Not necessarily just sex, but even cuddling or those small romantic gestures. We don't do any of it it, despite sleeping in the same bed two or three times a week. We give each other a peck on the lips when leaving each other, and that's about it.

I guess my question is... how does one start moving towards being physical with their significant other? The attraction is there (for me at least... though I'd imagine he's feeling similarly after 3 months as well...) I don't have much experience with relationships (in fact, these three months constitute the longest relationship I've ever had) and could just use some advice on all this. I'd be happy to answer questions and provide more info as necessary.

Thank you all!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all,

Long story short, I had a first date with the guy that I've been talking and the one that wanted to meet me for a while (I even posted a question about him), the date went fine and we've been keeping in contact since.  
  
Now, usually on Fridays-Saturdays (when we're free with tests and stuff like that), me and a couple of friends (no more than 3) usually go to a friend's house to play some party games, drink, watch a couple of movies and usually just sleep there (in the couple of times that we do sleep) and leave the next day in the morning.  
  
The question here is, I was thinking about inviting him along with me the next time we plan one of those, I spoke to my friends and they're totally fine with it and supportive of him coming along if he wanted to. So, how would you feel if I made you an invitation like that, I know this isn't properly a ""date"" but I really wanted him to come and have some fun with us, but I'm not sure it'd be too adequate, I'm sure he wouldn't feel excluded or anything like that since my friends hate that kind of stuff and I was honestly hoping he would say yes.  
  
TL;DR: I want to invite someone I've been talking to to a ""2nd date-ish"" more of a hangout with me and my close friends to play some party games, watch movies and drink a little bit.  
  
How would you react to an invitation like that?

I'm new to this subreddit, and I came seeking your advice and perhaps expertise. 

I've recently found a guy who has swept me off my feet. He's seriously a wonderful, caring person who I care deeply about. 

We have hit a small speed bump however, we've both really only topped in our past relationships. He does have some experience with being a bottom, though, and he's not opposed to being in that position occasionally. I, on the other hand, have only had two exceptionally bad experiences with being a bottom. Both of which (TMI about to happen) have ended with a small amount of blood being involved.

I have always wanted to be proficient in the bottom position, as I know many people love it. But I guess I'm just not sure what I should be doing to make it a pleasurable experience for both of us. So what sort of tips or advice would you give me in order to help me in my new adventure? 

Luckily the boy is caring and patient, so we have had a conversation about how he will need to ease me into it. But I'm just looking for ways to better prepare myself. Thanks in advance!

&lt;p&gt;I handle this by maintaining a lot of availability, but there are times when I feel like my life and times have not prepared me for dealing with the kinds of family schisms experienced by other dudes.  In this case especially, I have no idea how to address myself to a boyfriend who doubts, with good reason, that his family loves him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far I&amp;#39;ve done whatever I can to be there and make sure he&amp;#39;s not feeling like he&amp;#39;s facing her alone, spontaneous blanket and hot chocolate nights etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has anyone else approached this kind of a problem?  I can&amp;#39;t take the place of a whole family that has rejected him, but I hate watching him hurt like this.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it appropriate to confront her myself?  What can I do to at the least make her stop tormenting him like this?&lt;/p&gt;

I just wanted your thoughts on a situation I'm in.  I'm dating a guy and we have been together for about 3 months, both in early 20s.  We are both pretty newly out and everything seemed to be going extremely well.  We were very compatible, easy to talk to, etc.

One day he randomly was very ""stressed and depressed"" and did not really respond to my texts or calls.  He did not want to talk about why and basically wouldn't talk at all.  He came off extremely depressed (which I think he was suffering from beforehand as it was) and kept to himself. He said he is the type that just needs time to himself when feeling down and I can relate to that (to a certain extent).  

I assumed he was going to break up with me and just wouldn't do it for some reason, since everything had been going so well up until that point and changed with no warning.  I'm kind of a worrier that way.  After about a day of no contact he finally called me and explained that he had just been laid off and could no longer put in a bid for a house he wanted or continue to save toward starting his own business which is his dream.  Obviously he is crushed!!  We talked about it for a bit and I stressed I was there for him and his family and friends would be there for him and to not do anything rash.  After we talked about it I told him his reaction made it seem like he was going to break up with me, at which point I asked if that was what he wanted, and he replied, ""I didn't say that."" But at the same time, he wouldn't say anything like I miss you like usual when we hung up.

Since then, though, he still doesn't really answer me when I text or call him to cheer him up/check on him.  I'm ok with giving someone some space when going through a tough time, I like time to myself to reflect and calm down as well, but at a certain point it starts to feel personal.  Right now I can't tell if he's just really upset and not really talking to anyone, or if he's considering breaking things off for some reason.  I don't know how to feel or how to help him!

BTW: I just had surgery and am 3 hours away from him for a couple more days.  All of this happened from Sunday night til now (Wed)

TL;DR: Dating a guy, really like him, everything was going great, he suffered a personal tragedy and has completely distanced himself from me.  Is this normal?  Should I be concerned about our relationship?  How can I help him without being too pushy or clingy?

I understand the physically need, but I cannot wrap my head around the emotional need. 

I am not talking about your SO having other friends they hang out with. I mean them meeting other random people and essentially doing date-like things with them, alone, sometimes behind your back and sometimes just not drawing attention to it. Lots of texting. 

Can anyone describe what they would call ""the line"" when it becomes unhealthy in a relationship? Or, if it is always?

What are your experiences with this? Just trying to see this from a few perspectives.

&lt;p&gt;Has anybody else had this experience? Is this something I can just wait out and hope eventually I will be satisfied with him? I&amp;#39;m not sure what to do.. &lt;/p&gt;

So Valentine's day is exactly a month away and I decided that I want to surprise my guy with some sexy underwear. The only problem i that I know next to nothing about the topic- I wear loose boxers everyday and I'm not really the fashionable type. He told me his biggest turn on is ""tight underwear"" so I was wondering if you guys could help me out/give some suggestions. I would prefer something on the cheaper side and at least moderate coverage, but I welcome all forms of input! Also discreet packaging (lol) would be a plus, I'd have to pick it up from my college's mailroom. Thanks guys! ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey bros!

I've done some online dating in the past, but in my area (Ottawa, Canada) the dating pool of gay guys online could clearly use more chlorine. I've also noticed a lot of good-looking overtly gay guys around the city who aren't on these dating sites, which leads me to believe there must be a lot of good-looking gaybros out there who aren't using online dating either. 

So half a year ago I ditched online dating websites and tinder to instead spend more time on myself and my friends and take a break from the dating scene. Now I'm thinking about getting back on the market, and I feel like I'd much rather find guys in real life than online. And that's where the difficulty of figuring out who's interested comes into play.  

I've heard from many sources, that exchanging glances back and forth with a guy is a good way of finding out if he's interested, because gay guys will return the glances and straight guys won't give a damn, or at least won't look more than once. And first hand I've succeeded in doing this with three guys now, and it seems to work (one of them even made the effort to look back over his shoulder at me while walking to his bus). 

Although I'm very inclined to believe this works, part of me wonders if I'm just attracting the looks of straight guys who are wondering why this guy keeps looking at them. Also, any advice for getting enough nerve to actually do something in these situations? Because it doesn't seem to matter if we spend 10 whole minutes exchanging glances with one another, neither of us ever has the balls to say anything. So I'm basically going around town making missed connections.

Thoughts?

TL;DR Does exchanging glances really work at identifying who's gay in real life? From experience, I'd like to say it does. Even so, how do you get enough nerve to actually do something about it?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, so first some backstory.
