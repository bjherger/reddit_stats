I notice though that the more I think about it the more I would need someone to be a certain way in order for it to work, and it seems unlikely to find someone so specific and I imagine if I ever were to lay out my ""rules"" or criteria to a potential mate it would just turn him off as though it were a job interview or something.  Yet, it seems like best way to optimize a relationship, both sides spell everything out first so as not to be hit by surprises and deal breakers later.  I have a really long list though.

Anyone ever have success in outlining exactly what they want first?  What's the best way to go about it?

I've always been attracted to guys but never realized it was sexual. I have a foot fetish so I've always liked legs and feet guys or girls I'd get turned on.

At the same time I'm attracted to girls emotionally and physically, we the girls I do like don't like me that way and the ones who do show me any attention usually turnout lesbian or bi themselves 

The first time I was accused of being gay was 7th grade, ironically my best friends at the time were Robert and JD both who I've found out are gay. With JD I would jokingly pinch his nipples and poke him in his stomach (probably my subconscious attraction) I guess he enjoyed it. In 6th grade met the first gay guy *Tony he was in the 8th grade.

My girl crushes Mallory( lesbian) Kate (bi) Michelle (bi) Amy(lesbian) Frances (lesbian) Tiffany (lesbian) Jo (lesbian). Girls who liked me Teresa (lesbian) and Trisha (bi) they're actually dating each other.

Starting 9th grade I'm in a class with Tony he's a junior and he starts flirting with me asking if I had a girlfriend. No mostly I was too shy and a late bloomer. He'd rub my thigh and nipple so casually. Eventually he said he has a friend who'd give me a bj it was probably him through. With everything he said and did I never said no or stop.

My senior year in tech theater/video there was a really cute emo boy Luke my lab partner he was so obsessed with the fact I played football always grabbing and feeling my biceps. I even started fantasizing about worshipping his feet. Found out later he's gay. The other guy Sean a freshman kind of nerdy skinny with glasses and braces. He wore sandals to schools I loved stealing glances at his feet. Later that year my other partner Ashley told me she bi,lesbian now but she was dating Michelle. Later the year I met Mallory and Kate.

My first month of college I find out JD is gay when I was told I got the biggest hard on. I'd sneak into a corner of the library and read psychology books on homosexuality. At the job I have now there was this really cute guy Matt don't know why but I guess subconsciously I was a attracted to him and guess what he's gay too and his mom.
Another kid Trey was begging to come home and hangout with me. Saw he a few months ago definitely gay.

To make a long story short I'm fantasizing more about guys than girls sexually I really want to be with a guy, what started of with feet has moved onto the entire guy, chest, lips,penis etc.

With girls it's emotional and physical except the vagina I just find a huge turn off. But a penis gets me hot.

I've been traveling solo for a long time and this is one the ways I'm trying to fight loneliness.

I'll have a good conversation going with them, settle with them on a time and place for the next day and then, boom, they don't show up. Or get told 20 min before actual date they have something happening last minute and they can't come. Or they say we should meet for a drink, I say sure, when are you free? And then the convo dies.

Out of maybe 100 conversations, I met about 3. Not even for hook-up, just talk/drink/eat/whatever.

Is this the new normal?

Until 1 month ago I was a virgin. I used to be depressed about that for years. 

I believe there were several reasons why it took me so long to lose my virginity. No matter how many other gay guys I meet they just don't do it for me. None of them are good looking enough for me. I consider myself to be quite attractive. My only flaw is a bald spot on the back of my head. Also, I find a lot of gay guys to be quite racist towards Indians. 

One month ago I finally lost my virginity. It was a spur of the moment decision but I already regret it. I had to really lower my standards. The guy was ok looking but nothing more than that.

Lately I've really been trying to find a boyfriend but to no avail. Once again, one reason for my lack of luck could likely be the fact that a lot of gay guys are racist towards Indians.

I also don't like the idea of dating since I know that I'll be judged within the first minute of a date, and the guy won't be likely to change his opinion of me anymore after that.

Anyways, if a guy really likes me shouldn't he contact me? I don't see why I should contact other guys or people in general. They are the ones missing out after all. I've made the experience that some people can't be bothered to reply to my texts. That has to be for personal reasons. People just being busy can't be the reason. People who think that are kidding themselves. Well, when people text me I don't always get back to them anyway since they should be happy enough when I talk to them just some of the time.

This Valentine's Day I was very depressed. I wrote a few texts to my friends to punish them for not giving me the attention I deserve. They should have known I'd be depressed on Valentine's Day of all days. I love writing texts that are meant to show people my displeasure with them but aren't openly aggressive. Sometimes that puts me in a better mood but this time not even that worked.

I've really run out of ideas on how to find a boyfriend. Can anyone give me advice?

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m 19 and live in Calgary,Canada. It&amp;#39;s so hard to find gay guys around my age/generation (18-mid 20&amp;#39;s) here who don&amp;#39;t fall into the stereotype gays, I&amp;#39;m getting hopeless :/ I tried going on grindr and pof,nothing is working.There aren&amp;#39;t
any gay sports who cater to a younger crowd here as well.&lt;/p&gt;

I am not totally certain what I am looking for here - be it support, advice, random ""it will get better""s, or whatever... but here is my story.

A year and a half ago I got out of an abusive relationship. I got over all of that, grew, all that fun stuff since. 8 months ago I get back in contact with an acquaintance of mine - he is 31, I am 27 - that I had met on vacation a couple years back and we started chatting a lot. Daily phone calls, stuff like that. Turns out that he was moving to Texas at the time, something that I wanted to do. We talked and decided that I should come down to check it out. In August I made the trip after he had gotten settled down enough. I loved it in Austin! We had a great time together and I was certainly not wanting to go home. We continued talking each day and were somewhat getting to the point of flirting a relationship. I started applying for jobs in Austin and eventually landed a couple interviews in December. I flew down again for a few days for the interviews and while down here we started looking for houses to rent. I moved on December 29. We moved into this house on December 31. Three weeks later he had a friend in town for the weekend, during which he got a phone call that his dad was in the hospital in North Carolina from a heart attack and was going in to surgery. He left a day later and was gone for two weeks helping his parents. A week after he got back from North Carolina we left for a cruise that we had planned months prior. We got back a week ago today. I got violently ill the next day and was sick until Thursday. Finally returned to work Friday.

Friday night he tells me that things were not working out. He was not physically attracted to me, he was not emotionally attracted to me... and the worst part? He never was. Also... he is moving back to North Carolina as soon as he can - thank God he signed a lease before I moved down here and I had yet to sign on to it as well. He says there is no point in talking about things, working on things, or anything. I had absolutely no idea this was coming.

He says that he was hoping feelings would come. That he really wanted a life with me. All of the things that I knew I wanted. I feel hard and fast for this man. His move to NC is one of needing to be with family and something he had been thinking about for a while, so he says.

Here I am now in a new city where I hardly know any one, set up and camping out in the master bedroom (I took it... he can sleep in the guest room!) wondering where the fuck do I go from here? I basically have two options right now... pack up and move back home to Minnesota and pay my signing bonus back to work... or take that money and rent a new place, buy all new furniture (I didn't bring any down because he was able to furnish the entire house), and have no support system here.

I feel betrayed, lied to, manipulated, misled, and thoroughly disgusted by the entire situation. I think there is more going on in his head than he is saying, but honestly.. I will never know. I just want to go home to my mom and cry and cry, but that is something that I cannot do if I am going to have to spend the thousands on setting up my single life here. At the same time... I would rather go back in the dark and think that everything was fine and continue blissfully not knowing any of this and have him come in here and hug me and say it will all be okay.

I suppose I should ask: what would you do? I have a work trip next week to Salt Lake for a few days. I am getting back from there the weekend after next and will hopefully have my head on good enough to make rational decisions.

Though I've been overweight for years, I'm starting to do better thanks to self discipline and calorie apps (where were you all my life?!), although I still don't get as much exercise as I'd like. A year ago I was at 192 lbs, now I'm at 174 and slowly creeping downwards. I hope to be able to reach 165 lbs by the summer.

Like so many of us I've been trying to date through the internet, mainly through Grindr and a local gay site. Sadly, my response rate is not as high as I'd hope, which I assume is because I'm frankly not a 10 on the hotness scale, overweight or not, but I think I can go from a 3.5 to a 6 if I keep on doing stuff right. I've been living in my current area since August when I moved here for college and while I think I'm slowly but surely improving my appearance through getting thinner,* and getting better at taking selfies (what a time to be alive!), but I don't notice the response rates improving at all and almost no one except for old dudes initiates contact with me, even after I've talked to them a couple of evenings. Sadly, some of the people in my vicinity seem like they'd be really interesting and possible great matches, but they almost never respond or signal that they find me interesting.

Is it possible that I've ""scared off"" people by letting them see unfavorable pictures of me which they can use to dismiss my (hopefully) more attractive present appearance? Could things get better if I stay off dating until summer, remove my accounts and exercise like if Armageddon was imminent so I can reinvent my persona? Do I just need to keep improving my body and my pictures? Or am I doomed among those who have noticed me and didn't like what they see?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
 So I matched with this guy on Tinder in the beginning of February, he's an amazingly handsome guy, a diver that goes to a **really** good school. We chatted a bit then moved over to snapchat where we have been chatting back and forth pretty much non-stop everyday; we hit it off right away and conversations have been so natural. So we decided to go on a date and this past Friday he came to my area (we go to nearby universities in the Boston area). 
 I picked him up from the T station (subway/railcar) and we walked over to a Japanese BBQ restaurant and everything felt so natural. Again conversation was so natural and I felt so comfortable, while we were cooking our food and eating. When it came time for the check I said that I would pay for this dinner, and then he agreed that he would take me to dinner by him next.
 So we left the restaurant and went back to my apartment so I could throw on my winter boots bc he wanted me to show him around my campus and I took him on the roof of my building to look at the view of downtown Boston. He was getting over being sick and as we walked back downstairs he said something along the lines of ""pretend that was our first kiss."" 
 I showed him around campus, took him to a few interesting places, and then he saw a piano in one of the buildings and played me Clair de Lune (~~it was so sexy~~). Then we walked along the Charles River and at some point in our seamless conversation he said that this was a really great date and he was really enjoying himself.
So we kept walking and talking and flirting and joking and all that good date shit. Then when it go to the point where we were freezing beyond belief (it was around -4°F) he suggested we go back to my place and watch something. We got back to my place, I made some tea, and we decided to start watching Dexter together (romantic tv show about a serial killer ha) I gave him some sweatpants and we both got comfortable. While we were on the couch he commented on how he feels really comfortable with me (and I feel the same, we just hit it off like we knew each other). He had diving practice early the next morning but we decided to split a bottle of champagne anyway for some reason and he also asked if he could just spend the night since the T stops at 2AM and it was 12:30AM at this point. My roommate is out of town for the weekend so I offered him his bed and then we settled in and watched Dexter. We sat there cuddling all cozied up, then ended up kissing a little. Then a little more. Then the episode of Dexter ended and we got ready for bed. He walked into the bedroom and said ""I'm not sleeping in your roommates bed"" to which I agreed and then we hopped into my bed. We kissed some more and took our clothes off and kissed a lot more then cuddled and it was really nice. We both slept through his alarm, which meant he missed practice, but he said it was completely fine and that it was worth it. We got dressed and I walked him to the T station. We talked about how it might be a little while before we can get together again bc he has diving competitions the next two weekends. So we said so long and kissed then he hopped on the T. He texted me 20 minutes later saying that he ""Had a great time, thanks again man.""
 It was one of the best dates I have ever been on and I felt an instant connection with him (and he seems to feel the same). We've been talking since and all is well. *However* for whatever reason for the past two days after the date, I've felt really down and just kinda crappy and I don't know why. ~~(I cried in the library yesterday while teaching myself Arabic, wtf)~~ It also doesn't help that we pretty much can't get together for a month bc he has diving competitions for two weeks, then I'm on break for a week, and then the day before I come back he goes on break for a week. I'm not really sure what I'm hoping you gaybros can do but any advice or sharing of similar stories/experiences would be great. Thank you guys!

TL;DR Went on a really amazing date, he repeatedly said he felt the same. And now I'm sad for no reason and we won't be able to see each other for about a month. Help me stop feeling like shit.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This turned out to be much longer than I anticipated. If anyone reads it you are my hero.
