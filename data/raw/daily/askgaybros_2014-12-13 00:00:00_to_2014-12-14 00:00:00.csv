(the guy in that post apparently has [pectus excavatum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pectus_excavatum))

&amp;nbsp;

I also have that same condition. It was treated when I was a bit over 3 years old during an open heart surgery which was to fix a case of [atrial septal defect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrial_septal_defect). A congenital heart anomaly causing a weakening / hole(s) in the interatrial septum tissue which separates the two atria of the heart. I had a mid to severe case; Because of the sunken sternum my heart was twisted to the side and not capable of pumping efficiently. ASD caused oxygen-rich blood to mix with oxygen-poor blood so my body was only receiving about 60% of the oxygen it would normally have. Thanks to modern (90s) medicine all of the issues were successfully treated and fixed.

&amp;nbsp;

[This is what it looks like today, 17 years later](http://i.imgur.com/yqNDoeK.png). The scar has faded over the years but it's still very visible. Biggest issue with it is to find fitting shirts! :(

&amp;nbsp;



I've never really had any issues with guys being ""grossed"" out by it rather it's a conversation starter for me. 

&amp;nbsp;

I'd like to hear what you guys think of abnormalities, be it a missing limb or a birth defect. Would it be an issue in a relationship for you?

Have any of you read ""This Book is Gay"" by James Dawson? I've flipped through it in the bookstore and it seems like a good guide for newcomers.

I'm asking because my nine year old stepson may be gay. (He mentions how some guys are attractive to him, but I don't want to assume either way until he thinks about it for himself and tells us.)
Unfortunately, he's also painfully shy about some things, and doesn't like being thought of as 'different'. An example, we were in a souvenir store on vacation recently and there was a necklace he really liked. After ten minutes of trying to convince his dad to get it for him, he finally tried it on and decided it looked too 'girly' for him. I'm strongly against gender roles and the idea of anything being 'too girly' or 'too manly' so this just broke my heart. (I got it for him anyway and gave it to him when we got back.)

Anyways, my point is that because he is so shy and afraid of being different, I'm not sure he would tell us. And so maybe I already picked up the book. I'm deciding between just adding it to the family bookshelf and letting him discover it for himself, if he wants to, or waiting to give it to him when/if he comes out to us. (A few day later, I don't want to steal the importance of him telling us by handing him a book and going, ""Yeah, we thought you might be."")

Aaaand enough of my life story. Any advice, GayBros? Put the book on the shelf, or save it to give it to him if/when he tells us? Or other commentary/ideas for my stepparenting?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi GayBros,&lt;/p&gt;

I've worked hard to be more than just the virus, and I know plenty of people who can say the same, and it really sucks being looked at like just that one thing. Then of course there's the whole fact that it is a potentially fatal disease.

","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, I am poz and have been for the past year and a half(ish), and in that time I&amp;#39;ve had multiple big chasers contact me. I&amp;#39;ve never met with any of them, and while I try really hard not to judge anyone for their fetishes or desires (because I know sometimes you can&amp;#39;t really say what about a certain thing turns you on) this makes me incredibly uncomfortable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve worked hard to be more than just the virus, and I know plenty of people who can say the same, and it really sucks being looked at like just that one thing. Then of course there&amp;#39;s the whole fact that it is a potentially fatal disease. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess what I&amp;#39;m wondering is, has anyone else experienced something like this? Or even more, does anyone here identify as a chaser themselves? If so, I would love to hear what it is that you think about it, if you can say. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks everyone. &lt;/p&gt;

Anyways, my big and I grew extremely close extremely fast. He is hands down my best friend, and I would do absolutely anything for him. I guess I should also preface this with the fact that he is ""straight"" and I'm bi, though outwardly I identify as straight.

this is where it gets a bit complicated. About a year into our friendship, we got a little closer than friends normally do (at least in my experience). We started watching porn together, jerking each other off, etc. He graduated and moved away soon after this began, but we still see each other every month or two and sometimes that turns into jerking off together. I let him know that I was developing feelings for him, and he seemed downright surprised and apologized for leading me on etc, but let me know that it wouldn't affect our friendship at all. After that (tough) discussion, we stopped the sexual stuff for a while, but recently when he came to CA for a visit, I asked if he wanted to watch porn. He seemed hesitant at first and then into it. We did that for about 45 mins to an hour, and then went about our business. 

The next day I asked again and he said he had just finished doing that (in the shower), which was okay with me. I showered,  and when I got out he was in his towel. Part of our friendship is that we love to wrestle and butt antlers with each other. Anyways, he punched me so I punched him back (im in gym shorts at this point), and that became wrestling. 3 minutes in, his towel comes off and im on top of him still wrestling. This continues for like 30 minutes (nothing sexual). 

later that night I felt guilty for asking him to watch porn, so I told him that if it made him uncomfortable in any way I didnt want to do it anymore, and he said it didnt make him uncomfortable and he would let me know if it did, and when I asked if he wanted to stop he said no.

In addition to this, he constantly manages to relate things back to seemingly gay topics. As in, me:""you're a douche"" him:""lick my ass"" me: ""no thanks"" him:""but there are so many nerve endings"". I know for sure that he has done stuff with other guys, and despite identifying as straight, he has never had sober sex in any of his 4 sexual encounters with women. 

My question for you all is this: Am I absolutely crazy, or are these clear indications that my friend is at least bisexual. Do you all think anything could develop from this friendship or should I give up and just be happy to have such a close friend?
