I've known I was bisexual for about three years, when I was 16, it became clear that boys made me just as hard as girls did but as most teenage boys who find this out I tried to suppress it at first.

It's not too hard when you're bi because you have a whole gender left to choose from and I did alright but about a year ago I met Tom. He blew me away, so beautiful. 

It took me two months to get up the courage to make a move and it actually worked. He was my first everything with a guy, and he was okay keeping the relationship a secret and that lasted three months until he gave me an ultimatum and we broke up after I refused to come out because of homophobic family members and other reasons.

He's come back eight times over the last six months and we've hooked up. 

Three days ago he called me crying, telling me he loved me and that he didn't understand why I was doing this to him. I tried to calm him down but he was inconsolable. I later got a phone call from his mother telling me he was okay but he had been to the hospital but wouldn't tell me why, I don't think he harmed himself though.

I don't know what to do, do I stay away so he can get over me or do I go over there to talk to him and try to make him see sense? I don't know what will do the least amount of damage here.

**Edit:** Thanks for the advice guys, I really appreciate it.

So I could be wrong but I think my friendship is finally coming to and end. Ill call him J. I told him about my sexuality not to long ago, (I'll link the post when I can) but ever since things has kind of been going downhill. 

It's gotten to the point where I haven't even hung out with him at all this past week when we generally hang out like every other day. J and another friend of ours, D generally come over to my house when we chill. Last week when they were I was really pissed off at how much they just ignored me in my own damn house. That itself made me even more mad, cause I have very strong facial expressions so its easy to tell if im upset. They came over smoked my weed, popped my tabs, drank my booze and smoked up my cigs from the carton I had tucked away. Id be fine with that but the whole time they were here they just played music talked amongst themselves and played leauge of legends as If i wasn't even there. And this is only the most recent bs. J also seems to have completely lost his sense of time when it comes to dealing with me too.

Now I'm not being racist by saying this, seeing how my mother is black, but he's been running on colored people time worse than black people and he only does this with me. 
For example, it was my birthday and a few friends and I planned over 2 months before that we were going to the movies. The day of my birthday I get to his house to pick him up, and I walk in his room and he's knocked out sleeping. I go on about my plans and I get a text during the movie from him pissed off that I didn't wake him up even though he wasn't paying for the ticket.

Now I haven't talked to him in over a week so I messaged him on League today asking if he wanted to play a match and he replies back saying, ""Sure bro, just give me 5 mins."" So as I expect a whole 30 minutes passes and he messages me saying ok I'm ready. Pissed of at this point I say ""ill pass you coulda just said you had to something important to do instead of 5 minutes when you really needed 20.""
And he replies back saying this:
[7:44] wtf? 15* get your shit straight. i was on the phone when you asked to play. quit acting like a 13 year old girl. Youre a grown ass man. dont talk to me until you start acting like it.

Now, Am i just overreacting being sensitive, or has he been acting like a jerk? I'm just fed up with how he went from being a cool supportive friend when I came out to him to this. Thanks for taking the time to read this. Appreciate any opinions.

I pull up pictures of him if I&amp;#39;m alone, or I have kinky fantasies about him when I&amp;#39;m with someone else. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He and I still see each other a good amount, mutual friends and all that. I&amp;#39;m not in love with him any more, but I&amp;#39;m certainly in LUST with him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like I&amp;#39;ve orgasmically conditioned myself (we dated for quite a while) to be attracted to him, and I can&amp;#39;t break that cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any advice on moving on? I just want to be able to hookup with other people and be present with them in the moment, instead of thinking about some guy I used to have sex with.&lt;/p&gt;

I'll cut to the chase...I'm pretty sure my best friend has a crush on me. We message eachother pretty much every day, talking all the time. I've been single for years and years and in that time, he's been kind of like my 'partner' as it were, only without the sex. Kind of fufilling those needs? We talk everyday, all day pretty much. Swapping messages back and forth. I love his company. I love his personality. 

The thing is, he told me once before, when he was drunk. We were having an argument and he just blurted out that he liked me, and then ran away. I never spoke to him about it when he tried to talk to me, I felt too awkward, but he assured me that he was just directing his feelings to me because I was his closest friend. Maybe we should have had more of a dialogue...

After that he got a boyfriend, and our friendship kind of went to shit. He never told me about the boyfriend, so I pretty much severed ties with him for a bit. We gradually got to talking again and so over the years we've grown close again. Practically brothers. 

But thats what worries me. He is very sensitive. I wind him up all the time but he often gets really worked up. Like more so than if it was just a simple friendship. He's a very dramatic guy by nature, but sometimes I just get the feeling. He seems to be more involved. 

What should I do? Should I mention it to him or is it presumptious? Since he said it before, even though he said his feelings were misaligned, I feel like they could pretty easily become reestablished.

So here's the deal. I'm 26, and had been dating my first boyfriend for two months. I know that this might seem silly, and that two months doesn't seem like that long, but I really care for him. Not just because I had so many 'first' experiences with him, but because for the first time I really felt like I could be myself around somebody.

Near the beginning of our relationship he had mentioned how he had just gone through a big breakup in January, and wasn't sure how much time he was prepared to commit to us. I was fine with that, and things seemed to progress OK from there. On Friday he brought it up again, saying that he wanted us to try seeing each other only 2-3 times a week, which again I said I was fine with. He was so patient with me at the beginning so I thought I owe it to him to be just as patient with him. That night he brought me out to meet a whole bunch of his friends, and everything seemed great.

On Sunday night he seemed distant, so I asked him on Monday morning if everything was OK and he said that he 'couldn't do this'. He thought that he was ready to date people again but he was wrong, and that he just finds himself feeling angry all the time. He was very emphatic that it was nothing to do with me, and told me he thought I was great, but that he just wasn't ready. I was shocked, and told him that I'd give him any amount of time or space that he needed, but he still left.

I feel broken. I basically haven't gotten out of bed for more than an hour at a time in the last couple of days. I'm not only sad because of the end of the relationship, but I am sad that he was feeling these things and didn't tell me. I hate that he feels this way and want to help him feel better...he is such a sweet guy, it makes me want to pummel the person that did this to him.

I did tell him before he left that if he ever feels ready to give me a call, and he said that he would but told me not to wait for him as he didn't know how long it might take. Part of me says that I should just try and move on, but a larger part of me wants to give him a month or so to collect his thoughts and then just send him a message along the lines of ""Been thinking of you lately, hope you're feeling better. I'm here if you want to talk.""
