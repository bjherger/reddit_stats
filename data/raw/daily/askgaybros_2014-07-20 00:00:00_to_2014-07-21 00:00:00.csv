My dad started making some snide comments (""oh look, they must be lesbians!"") about them, so I decided to test out his opinion on non-heterosexuality. We do 'discuss' on any topics we happen to come across, so it's not like it's out of the blue for him, but what I get from him afterwards is really shocking and devastating.

First, he said something about homosexuality not being in the ""natural order of things"", so I replied well hurtling at 35,000ft above sea level in a giant metal tube isn't natural either, to which he said that it wasn't his point. His point was that the ""natural order"" of living beings is to propagate genes, and that by being homosexual they're disregarding that ""natural order"", and intentionally not contributing to humanity by removing themselves from the gene pool. I mentioned that there are instances of homosexuality in the animal kingdom, does that mean that they're ""unnatural""? And because they don't produce any offspring, then why do they still continue to exist generation after generation? So my dad says that perhaps every generation has a few of those ""chosen"" to be taken out of the gene pool, maybe aiding in population control. But then, he added, these are animals, they act out of instinct and cannot change what they are. Us humans, however, have the ability to choose not to engage in such ""activities"" and if we decide to follow that ""instinct"", then we're no better than those animals in this sense. He continues to say that we must have a ""value system"" to follow, and we must do what's ""right"" and not what's ""wrong"", and to him, homosexual acts are extremely immoral behavior. While he's not going to say anything about others who engage in such acts or take part in such a lifestyle, he ""will **NEVER** accept"" homosexual behaviors. And he ascertains that non-heterosexuality is partly caused by improper upbringing, such as lack of a father figure or instilling improper values, and says that if anyone (including us) turned out not to be straight, this means that they've failed as parents. He even went so far as to mention a talk he attended at my brother's school about 6 or 7 years ago, where an ex-gay came up to talk about how he get rid of his ""homosexual desires"", ""came clean"" and now (back then) had a wife and kids, a ""proper family unit"", and that he (the ex-gay) says that he no longer has such ""desires"" and non-heterosexuality is just immoral behavior of people. At this point, I had nothing more to say, so we just ended the discussion like that and continued on other topics/stuff. 

I really don't know what else to say at this point, so guys, is it remotely even possible to convince him from his stance on homosexuality? Bear in mind, this is from a man whom I respected and looked up to all these 20 odd years of my life, most of what he says were never too far from making sense, and being someone who doesn't have many friends irl, my parents are the only ones who've been with me throughout all these years. And what if he's right? What if we're really only freaks who don't have much use in society, that we'll forever not belong? That we're better off not being in this world in the first place, and we're only here on ""borrowed time""? And even if he's wrong, do we really have and want to be who we are, and be constantly be on the run from people whom we (used to) love and respect, like fugitives from a crime we didn't commit or even knew was a crime in the first place? I don't know anymore, I really feel like this is unfair, like a curse to me, making everyone in the world hate me for something I have no control/choice over, and even the ones who've always loved me and supported me for who I am seemed to show that they won't anymore if I ever let them know about this part of me. I feel **FUCKING TERRIBLE**! Really wished I could crawl into one corner and just die right now...

So, it started with me (19) meeting roommate A (35) on Grindr a few nights ago. I wanted a guy to cuddle and spoon me and he had a hairy chest, so I went over and spent the night at his. We talked a bit and I found out he's a lecturer at my university... thank fuck he was teaching another faculty, otherwise I would have bailed instantly. I had a good time. We kept chatting and I asked him about his roommates, he mentioned one was a guy and I asked if he was attractive, so he showed me his Grindr and yeah he was. 

Fast forward to the Saturday, I had planned on going out so I had a few (too many) drinks beforehand at dinner and started getting ready to leave. I do my regular Grindr check before leaving to see if I can arrange anything for later on. I see that his hot room mate (27) is very close to me, so I msg him without even thinking to see what he was doing. I remembered that Roommate A mentioned to me that he was not in town for the weekend and I saw this as my opportunity to meet up with roommate B. 

So we talked for a few minutes and then he asked me to come back to his for the night. At this time, I was hoping that roommate A had not mentioned or shown him my Grindr profile, and I guess he didn't because B did not recognize me. I arrived at his, we watched TV for a bit and had a few drinks before heading off to bed. I had a REALLY good time and I hardly slept that morning. For some fucking reason, I decide to show him my Grindr to see if we had been talking to the same guys etc. Let's just say that roommate A had mentioned me but didn't exactly show him my profile, but we spoke about a particular guy I was keen on for a while, and he had mentioned this roommate B because he was a mutual friend of his. Roommate B of course saw this guy on my Grindr and I said yeah I'm keen on him. 

*HE FIGURED IT OUT AND I WAS FUCKED AT THIS POINT AND WAS ABOUT TO DIE OF EMBARRASSMENT.*

Thankfully he did not mind at all, and we kind of laughed it off. 

Today I got a msg from roommate A telling me that he had returned to town. I was like hey, cool hope you had a good time. He asked me how my weekend was.. I said it was good thanks, nothing too crazy went on. Replies with a fucking winky face ;) and I knew that roommate B had told him. Turns out they're both fine with this..? and I should be too guess. 

Problem is.. they both want to keep hanging out. Roommate A even said that tonight (Sunday) is his turn to have me wtf? I told him that I am going out to dinner and I will let him know. I even jokingly said that it's his third roommates(a chick) turn with me tonight to too mask the awkwardness of what he just said.

I like B more than A for a number of reasons such as, not as big of an age difference, makes me laugh more, I find him more attractive and he isn't a member of staff at my university. But I'm scared to let them know.. I'm assuming they would not care, much like how they didn't care about me meeting up with both of them the first time, but I honestly would feel awkward every time I go over to their place and fool around with one guy while the other is in the room next to us.

Long time askgaybros reader, first time poster – I have a simple question: does anyone else in a long term relationship struggle with monogamy?  

From the outset I will point out that I have always been 100% faithful to my partner and never cheated (despite no shortage of opportunities) but it still doesn’t stop me thinking about other guys. Is anyone else like this?

A bit of background and context: I am approaching 30 and have been in a long term and monogamous relationship most of my adult life. I have been with my current partner for over six years and we have been living together for five years. We are very happy together and have a great relationship, and enjoy a fantastic material standard of living and have a network of supportive family and friends. We rarely have disagreements and we don’t get involved in drugs.

My partner is very good looking and gets hit on by guys (and girls) all the time. We are also sexually compatible (I will spare you the details but read between the lines). So, In a nutshell, I am living the ‘gay dream’ and I am sharing this not to gloat but to point out my wandering eyes are not due to some underlying dis-satisfaction with my relationship. 

In the past I had thought the problem was because my partner’s sex drive was not as high as mine but this is not the case – looking back, I felt the same way in my previous long term relationship when I was getting sex twice a day so I don’t attribute my continual perving to lack of sex.

I don’t want an open relationship and all the baggage that goes with it. Neither do I want to be single – as much as I really enjoyed my time as a single, that’s not what I’m after. Also, I travel a lot for work so get a lot of time by myself in foreign cities where I theoretically could get it on the side but never have – not because I don’t want to, but rather because I am committed to my partner. 

So, I suppose I’m wondering, do other people feel like this  - happy committed but still want to fuck other guys (and yet don’t)? 

TL:DR – I am very happy and in love with my partner but still want to stick my dick into other guys. Am I normal?

He's overweight but not horribly so and says he wants to change himself but until I see him make an effort it's all talk. I want to help him as much as I can but I've seen similar things with my room mate and I'm kinda worried. I'm not sure if I should bring this up to him at all. 

Second, he has herpes (HSV 2) that he got from his ex girlfriend. I know the risk of transmitting it is small, condoms won't protect fully against it and we have had sex without protection. I was wanting him to look into getting pills to help since I'd feel a lot more safe if he was doing that. Even though he almost never has an outbreak it still has me concerned.

I'm extremely embarrassed that I ever did think that way. 

Here I am now, out to my friends, hooked up with some guys, I know that I'm on the right track. However, I still don't feel confident in my own skin. I still get affected by people's offhand comments, I don't feel desirable by other men, I just feel more alone sometimes. I dread telling my parents because I don't know how they'll take it.
