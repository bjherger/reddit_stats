I'm just posting this to a crowd that I can relate to. Feel free to skip over it, or if you can relate, I'd love some input. Warning: wall of text ahead.

TL;DR Me and boyfriend of 2 years broke up, I met a really cool guy named Dan who has a mutual liking for me, but he has a boyfriend. I miss ex, and I can't see myself dating anyone else but him, with the exception of Dan, who I think I like more than my ex at this point...

So some background: me and my boyfriend of 2 years broke up in February. We'll call him Chris. We had been drifting apart for quite some time prior to the break up, but we had always gotten along great. We never fought, and we had many common interests, but there was no chemistry between us. We had sex about once every two weeks, if that. We never kissed because he had really bad breath and didn't take care of himself, which was a big turn off for me. Also, I have a chronic illness which I was diagnosed with back in September, and I'll be the first to admit that I wasn't the happiest person in the world around the time we broke up, but since then, I've been seeing a psychologist, and I feel my anger and frustration about the illness subsiding.

Now there is this guy named Dan who got a job at the place I'm at a few weeks before me and Chris broke up. From the moment I saw him, I was instantly attracted to him. He is so damn hot, and has a smile that could melt an iceberg. His personality is fantastic, and when we talk, we click so well. He can relate to some of the issues that I have, such as social anxiety, and we both have troubled pasts with substance abuse. I just click with him so well, and I feel like he really gets a lot of the bullshit that I've went through in the past. Anyways, when he started, he'd flirt hard core with me, but he seemed straight, so I thought he was being overly friendly for a while, until he added me on facebook and it was confirmed that he is indeed gay. So we chatted for a little bit, and he revealed to me that he already has a boyfriend who he's only been with for a few weeks. So basically I dropped him from there and that was that.

Anyways, back to after Chris and I broke up, I fell into a deep depression. I didn't eat, I lost a crap ton of weight, I was always sad and lonely; the usual post-break up situation. That lasted a few weeks, then I started pulling myself out of it and started distracting myself from thinking of Chris by hanging out with friends and exercising. Fast forward a week into April (so about 6-7 weeks after Chris and I broke up) I started talking to guys online just to go on some dates. Online I met a guy that we'll call Tanner. We started talking for a little bit, then that turned into texting, then that turned into going on a date all in a weeks time. We got along pretty well for the most part. The date went fine. I thought he was nice, decent looking, has a future. We cuddled at my house for a little while towards the end. No kissing though. The next week, we went on another date and did basically the same thing, except with a little kissing. The thing about him was that he was fresh out of the closet, so he hadn't done anything before with anyone, and he is 20. So when we first kissed, I didn't really get the spark that I did with any of my ex's. I thought it was because of his lack of experience at the time, so I just looked past it and we ended our date and that was that. That was 2 weekends ago. Last week, I had grown very irritable with him. I initially blamed it on him *constantly* wanting to text me. We'd literally text 24/7 to no end. I'd give him one worded answers to things in hopes he'd get bored or something, but instead he'd just ask me if I'm okay or if I was mad, and that would just make me even more irritable. Then I'd stop texting him, and then he'd text me even more trying to strike up another conversation. So that went on all of last week. We had set up our third date to be last Friday also. So when Friday came around, I was feeling pretty under the weather. I really didn't wanna talk to anyone, and I certainly didn't want to go on a date, so I texted him and cancelled a good 12 hours ahead of time, which he was pretty mad about, but I didn't really care. Around 6 pm, I had woken up from a nap, and I was feeling really bored and lonely, so I texted him and asked if he just wanted to come over. He said yes, and when he came over, I made it explicitly clear that it wasn't a date, which he was okay with. Long story short, we cuddled for a while, then I initiated some sexual things and I couldn't even get hard when he tried reciprocating. It was so humiliating, but I took it as a sign. Essentially I told him to leave and that we shouldn't see each other anymore, and blamed it on the fact that I still am in love with my ex (Chris). So when he left, I just lost it and started bawling, and I wrote Chris a note saying how I miss him and love him and blah blah blah and mailed it to him. So the next day, Saturday, I go to work and Dan happens to be working that day too. Being my friend, I tell him everything that had happened the previous night, and then we just get to talking about other general things. Then he invites me out to dinner, and of course I accept. On my drive there, I completely forget about my feelings for Chris and I'm so focused on Dan, that I start feeling so much better. So he finishes up his shift and we go out and talk, and we have a really good time. We ended up talking about the situation between him and I, and basically what he said is that it's obvious that we like each other both mentally and physically, but he does have a boyfriend, and had he met me a month earlier, we'd be together instead. He also told me that he is still in love with his ex, and bad mouthed his current boyfriend a bit.

So basically, I really like Dan, but he has a boyfriend. And I really miss Chris, but I don't know if I miss him, or I miss having a boyfriend. I don't know. I just feel really depressed and lonely, and I miss having someone to come home to when I'm done with my sessions to treat my illness. If you read all of this, I applaud you.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey bros. I&amp;#39;m just posting this to a crowd that I can relate to.

I went out with a wonderful guy, smart, talented, great looking. A real prince charming. We had a magical date on a roof top wine bar in Laguna beach and watched the sunset. We went down to the beach and smoked a joint, had an amazing time together. He sit up on the cliff and look out the stars and we kiss. Magic.

We go thru the awkward questions. Preferences ect. Finally he admits to me his HIV status. I hug and him give him a kiss on the cheek. I first ask him his viral load and if he's on medication. He tells me he doesn't know and isn't yet as he has been healthy.. I tell him I need to be sober before I can properly tell him what I think of it all. We continued to have an awesome evening.

Today I am feeling pretty down. I know enough not to be afraid that we made out. I did tell him I would hang out again, I just need to do some research and prepare myself mentally. 

Bros, especially who have dealt with HIV, what questions do I need to ask, and what should be my next steps...? I literally took an OraQuick test the night before the date and it came back negative for me.

Guys, I feel horrible. I have a prince charming who just wants me to keep talking to him, and part of me is petrified. Can I be intimate with someone that every time I do something with them I have to worry I am taking a risk to my own health? Do I emotionally invest in someone that I may not be able to have kids and grow old with?
