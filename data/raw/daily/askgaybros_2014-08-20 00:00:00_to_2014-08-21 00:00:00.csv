I try so hard to hide it, but I still feel these things.

I broke up with my girlfriend that I've known since kindergarten. We have been semi romantic since grade 8 and sexual since grade 12. I'm 22 now and this ended in January. Every positive memory or life moment has her in it.

The hardest part of the break up was to see how hurt she was and is. I cried every night for a month, I tried so hard to stay strong but I frequently just couldn't maintain functional an entire day.

I told my parents, there were shocked. They just kept saying how they can fix this, how they can change this, what went wrong, there must be someone I can talk to do get through this (be straight again). Might dad said he doesn't approve of this, but will 'support' me. My mom just can't believe how I can be this way. They are still nice to me, its just I can tell they baffled. And they keep trying to pin my ex-gf on me or hint how it can work, or remind me of something that 'isn't gay' that I've done.

I'm not allowed to tell my family, and I'm not allowed to tell me sister (she's 16). So to half my extended family me and my ex just broke up because it didn't work, and to the other half we are still dating.

I love them, I understand they need time to process, but I can't help just being so bitter and angry at it. I don't want to eat dinner with them, I don't want to sit with them, I don't want to be around them. But then I feel terrible and guilty since I love them.

My best friend has been extremely supportive. He's always there to talk and help me or hangout or whatever I need. My other two close friends know, and are there for me, they don't care, but I've tried not to talk to them much, only sometimes to keep them sort of a stable escape for me.

The problem I'm facing is weird and I feel terrible for it. They are all male, one side of it I'm so incredibly thankful they are there for me and still my friends, but I just get frustrated they don't fully understand.

People say things to me like 'just go meet people', 'go find some gay guys to hang out with'. I can't. I don't know where. Or how. Or anything. There isn't places full of gay men waiting for me anywhere like people seem to think.

I'm really scared of telling people, and have only told a few close friends. I feel like I'm in a box still, but I don't want to tell people because its not something that should concern them (but I feel better when they know), so I feel selfish just out of the blue telling someone 'oh I'm gay now'.

I have another close friend that I've made recently, he's friends with my other friends, that's how I met him. He knows I broke up with my girlfriend, but doesn't know I'm gay like my other friends. I always want to tell him, but never can get myself to because its so weird to say it out of the blue when it doesn't effect us. Its never come up, so I've just never said anything, but I know I'd feel better if he knew, but feel selfish to do so.

My best friend told me to just do things and hobbies I enjoy and I'll meet someone. Well, to me, this is what I've done my whole life and still do. That's how I made them as friends, and most of the time I'm just left in heartbreak for crushing on straight guys just to have to mentally end it in my mind because they are straight. Which, I've gotten really good at.

Part of me is jealous and hurt. My best friend just meets girls in his daily life, at the restaurant he works at, at school, etc. he can flirt with, and to me, I don't ever meet these people doing the things I do in my life that I love. I can't flirt with the cute guys at school I meet, its weird, and they are straight.

I hang out with my friends and they talk about the cute girls they met and flirt with, I'll go to a bar with them and I'll have fun, but I'm also hurt there's so many girls for them there. And it just gets frustrating.

I never cared before. I had a girlfriend. Now that I don't its so frustrating to me.

To me, and perhaps I'm completely immature. They have it WAY easier.

And to me, I am so hurt and loathing over the fact that I had the great life. I had the perfect girl. I could have gotten married and had kids. I had everything I wanted and I was happier then I am now.

But one thing got in the way, I happened to be gay. I've been seeing a counselor, and I've tried anti-depressants to help me get me out and about more. Nothing takes the pain and hurt I feel away though.

I want to meet other gay guys, but Grindr and Craigslist just leave my crying and frustrated. No one on there interests me, everyone just seems so superficial, and the fact that all they care about is specs hurts me, who actually won't meet you because your dick is .5"" too short for their liking. After having been in a serious relationship and having so many great friend, I can't help but not want anything to do with these guys.

Gay clubs in the area are fun for a night out and dancing with other guys, but its not my thing at all, I'm introverted and like to talk and meet people one on one. Any friend I've had I've just met going about the things I like to do.

I'm starting to hate myself because of all these petty emotions and feelings. I have a great group of supportive friends, and yet I'm still hurt and frustrated. I feel like an asshole.

I used to look at my bf's phone often if he got a text, I would just glance and see who he was messaging. He has caught me a couple times and usually brushed it off as a joking snide gesture or something. He honestly just does work or school stuff. I since stopped, but I had a couple times still. I'm sure he has too. He'll make jokes about who is texting me or stuff like that.

I glanced today and I saw he had several selfies here and there and a lot of random pictures. I got curious and wondered what, when and maybe who he takes pictures with(?) I trust him, he's a good guy but I did get curious about what pictures he takes. I feel like knowing more about him and and seeing and/or getting more pics of him. I just like him like that, I get curious and nosy. I like knowing what he does, in an endearing way. He doesn't take pictures a lot with me or at all. We used to send each other face pics a lot, but not recently since he's busy. An insecure part of me wondered if he has sent face pics to other friends, but that's just bad thinking.

Just wondering, what are you're policies or opinions on personal space with a phone or sending pictures? 

I know we are both entitled to our privacy, but I sometimes feel nosy and feel it's okay to be nosy. I won't grab his phone and look through it, but it would be fun, and disrespectful though. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My bf and are both 20 and we&amp;#39;ve been together for about one year and about five months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to look at my bf&amp;#39;s phone often if he got a text, I would just glance and see who he was messaging. He has caught me a couple times and usually brushed it off as a joking snide gesture or something. He honestly just does work or school stuff. I since stopped, but I had a couple times still. I&amp;#39;m sure he has too. He&amp;#39;ll make jokes about who is texting me or stuff like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I glanced today and I saw he had several selfies here and there and a lot of random pictures. I got curious and wondered what, when and maybe who he takes pictures with(?) I trust him, he&amp;#39;s a good guy but I did get curious about what pictures he takes. I feel like knowing more about him and and seeing and/or getting more pics of him. I just like him like that, I get curious and nosy. I like knowing what he does, in an endearing way. He doesn&amp;#39;t take pictures a lot with me or at all.

I'm quite prudish in nature, I would never consider hook-ups because I believe sex to be a very intimate and personal act, that's 100x better when you're in love.

Above all else though... I'm a guy. I get just as horny as the next dude, and since I'm not allowed any outlets in the dating world, I've resorted to sweet-talking guys on messenger apps and trading face, body and dick pics. It was something I'd told myself I'd never do, but once I started doing it, my confidence in my body skyrocketed (I used to have slight depression and low self-esteem), and now I just smile a lot more, happy that somebody out there has found me briefly attractive.

I'm not an idiot, I have set up some basic ground rules:

- No face/dick in the same shot

- Don't get too attached or meet up with anyone

- Make sure nobody would recognise the background in shots (if they knew me personally)

- Try to avoid chatting with people who are from my general area

If I'm missing something that could be compromising my safety/opening me up for blackmail, please let me know. I'm wary about sending face pics, but I'm not sure how much it could be used against me as long as I keep the rest of my body out of it. I understand that there are certain risks when sending strangers such sensitive material, but doing this has also helped me to stop hating my body. I won't have a boyfriend for a LONG time, but I would definitely stop sending pics if I was in a committed relationship. 

It's probably inevitable that one or two pics will end up on some weird Tumblr blog, but that's fine - as long as no one knows it's me, I'm starting to care less about who sees it, as long as they like it (:

I'll be 20 in 2 days. We met last year on my birthday via a dating app...

 It sounds really sleazy, but that night was the best sex of my life. After a few weeks I panicked, and wanted out. I was not ready to commit, he was hurt.

6 months later we start hooking up again as casuals, and I start to develop feelings for him. I thought we were on the same page... I was wrong.

I had the best 3 months of my life. Never was I so connected to another person. I wanted to marry him!

But then, he started giving me cold shoulders, blowing me off, and fucking dozens of other guys. 

I was hurt, and apparently it was clear that because I hurt him, we can never be more than sex buddies. 

We stopped seeing each other, I was extremely hurt, I kept wanting to change the past, to make it so I wouldn't hurt him, to get him back. I loved him. I don't care how short our time together was. He wasn't my first nor my second boyfriend. It was real.

I thought I was moving on, but every guy I dated was just... Not him. I kept thinking of him, and I would see him kissing others at parties and hate myself and him for that.

I deleted him from Facebook last Friday, and he got hurt and started getting mad at me, saying I'm a bad friend. I wrote him a huge wall of text, saying how much I care about him, and how much I'm hurt, and he just said ""whatever. It sucks that we can't be just friends.""

He makes me act like a teenage girl Taylor Swift writes songs for.

I've reached a low point, where I don't mind waiting for him to grow up and realize I'm the one for him, because we were meant for each other.

See? This is so cheesy. I can't believe I'm saying this crap. But its so true, I've been knowing it for 5 months now.

Let him go? How can I let go of the best guy I knew?

We had good times. I know how amazing he can get. 

My birthday is in 2 days, and I'm just waiting to see what he'll message me. Chances are, I won't get anything more than a ""Happy birthday :) ""

That is, if he'll even say something. But I'm still clinging to that possibility.

Isn't that sad? I think it's pretty sad. I'm pathetic.

I needed to say this.. Thanks.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey AGB,

&lt;p&gt;I was hurt, and apparently it was clear that because I hurt him, we can never be more than sex buddies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stopped seeing each other, I was extremely hurt, I kept wanting to change the past, to make it so I wouldn&amp;#39;t hurt him, to get him back. I loved him. I don&amp;#39;t care how short our time together was. He wasn&amp;#39;t my first nor my second boyfriend. It was real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought I was moving on, but every guy I dated was just... Not him. I kept thinking of him, and I would see him kissing others at parties and hate myself and him for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I deleted him from Facebook last Friday, and he got hurt and started getting mad at me, saying I&amp;#39;m a bad friend. I wrote him a huge wall of text, saying how much I care about him, and how much I&amp;#39;m hurt, and he just said &amp;quot;whatever. It sucks that we can&amp;#39;t be just friends.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He makes me act like a teenage girl Taylor Swift writes songs for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve reached a low point, where I don&amp;#39;t mind waiting for him to grow up and realize I&amp;#39;m the one for him, because we were meant for each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See? This is so cheesy. I can&amp;#39;t believe I&amp;#39;m saying this crap. But its so true, I&amp;#39;ve been knowing it for 5 months now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let him go? How can I let go of the best guy I knew?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had good times. I know how amazing he can get. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My birthday is in 2 days, and I&amp;#39;m just waiting to see what he&amp;#39;ll message me. Chances are, I won&amp;#39;t get anything more than a &amp;quot;Happy birthday :) &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is, if he&amp;#39;ll even say something. But I&amp;#39;m still clinging to that possibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isn&amp;#39;t that sad? I think it&amp;#39;s pretty sad. I&amp;#39;m pathetic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I needed to say this.. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

He's the only sexual partner I've had in 2 years. I got checked out because I had some discharge, and they tested it and said it was gonorrhea. The bf and I hadnt had sex in 1 week, and he has no discharge at all. What I'm asking, is it possible that he's had it for 6months with no discharge and gave it to me? Could I have gotten it from touching something at the club? Is there some way this was all just an accident, or do I have to assume the worst? 

*EDIT: I just want to add that I trust him completely!  We've been through a lot together. But the doctor wasn't very good at explaining how I could have gotten it other than we should both be tested. They wouldn't tell me how long he could have it without showing symptoms etc. And yes, I told him that I have it and we both need to be tested. He was just as confused as I am.

I thought maybe things were just a little painful for him, but he even rejected my offer to do him after I finished. He says that he used to take some medication that affected his sex drive and it's been like that ever since.
