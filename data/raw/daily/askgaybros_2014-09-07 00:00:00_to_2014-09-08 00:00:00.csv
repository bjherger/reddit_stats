Here's some background:
I met this guy three weeks ago on Grindr. I carefully explained to him that sex is not particularly important to me anymore, but that I'm looking for a romantic interest where sex is of course a natural byproduct. He agreed and said that he wanted to meet me immensly. I visited his place, we hit it off nicely, talked for hours... Of course one thing led to another and we had sex. For the next few days, we were texting regularly (this is important for later). A couple of days later, on a Monday, he came to my place and spent the night. After that, he wouldn't reply to my texts or answer my calls for a couple of days.

I received a call on Thursday saying that he had turned his phone off because he had been busy working on his college degree paper. During the following two weeks, we exchanged maybe five texts and I called him two times; he gave me the impression that he had just been busy and that he was looking forward to seeing me again. Fast forward to Friday, two days ago. Since the previous visits happened at a vacation place, and we live about 80 miles away, I was excited when he said that he would be visiting my city, where his college mentor also lives. We met in a park and talked about the future, and he said he hopes to continue what we have, but that we'll have to take it slow since we picked a bad time for it due to his college work. 

I told him that's fine and that I have no problems waiting and taking things slow. Since he doesn't have Facebook, I sent him a text later that day asking him where I could send him links and photos. After his not replying for 24 hours, I sent a text after exactly 24 hours saying ""24 hours. Seriously?""  He promptly replied with a smiley face and then, after I asked the question again, answered it. We continued the chat for awhile, and then after about an hour of chatting, he just disappeared.

Now for the most important part: During this entire time, except for the period where he said he had turned his phone off, he has been online on Grindr multiple times each day WHILE I was waiting for him to reply to my text. A couple of hours reply time, ok. A couple of days, ok. But if he's online on Grindr during that time, that makes me feel betrayed and not important to him at all. 

My question is: what should I do? Confront him? Play it cool?

Tl;dr: Have feelings for guy, he forgets about texts and uses Grindr while not replying.

I remember it like it was yesterday.

I wanted to reach out and help people. Every day I would lurk on the /r/gay subreddit and see so many people struggling. I'm not a magician, but I figured I could at least try. That's when I came across a post from a user named HalifaxG.

http://www.reddit.com/r/gay/comments/1vwftv/gay_and_ugly/

Halifax, you see, was a standard depressed individual. He felt outcasted. It wasn't enough. Everyone gave him generic words of encouragement and while I'm not trying to come off as self-righteous, I can attest that ""things get better, just hang in there"" isn't enough when you're so far down in the dumps that your own value and self-worth comes under constant scrutiny -- from yourself.

Imagine you're in a dark room. Something's in this room with you, but you can't see it. You hear it's whispers. It's words phase together into a garbled mess as if it speaks with five mouths, and through the nonsense it speaks you can decipher some words, words that tell you that you have failed. This thing, you try to get away from it, but you're bumbling in the dark. You can't outrun it. The sad part is that the room isn't actually dark. In fact it's not a room at all. You're in a bright sunny field, there's a tall oak tree with a wheel swing to the side, and it's pure serenity, but you're blind. You're blind and you don't know it, it all came so suddenly, that you think you're confined and alone. You can almost hear the birds chirping, you can almost feel the suns rays, but the demon... he remains close. Is it any wonder it manages to remain so close when that demon isn't a separate entity at all, but actually yourself?

This was how I imagined Halifax. I've been there. A desperate and futile attempt to try and outrun oneself, I wanted to offer a helping hand the best way I could. I was gilded. I was praised. These things meant nothing. I wanted Halifax to see the light. I wanted Halifax to open his eyes. His words bothered me, the undertones written with sincere apathy. Couldn't budge even if I pushed him, and I did try. I did try to push him. I tried with everything I could. I've never met this man. To this day I don't know who he is, but I did not like what I was seeing none-the-less.

...so Halifax stayed in mind. One of the first people I've helped and I've helped many since, but he was the first. He stuck out in memory. Today I was curious to know if HalifaxG ever made any more posts. I was convinced it was just a throwaway and I'd never see it again - in my mind I honestly wanted to believe he moved on and got better. Of course, I didn't *actually* believe that. These kinds of things don't just go away.

Imagine my surprise then, when I see that HalifaxG did post! He posted in this very subreddit. Wow, I wonder what the topic was about...?

http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/2budnb/suicide/

6 months later.

6 months after the time I tried to help him, 6 months after the reaching out, the hand I offered to him, and the idea I truly wanted to believe where he actually took my hand, and rose himself up out of this pit, was gone.

I felt defeated, but worse so I felt an overwhelming sense of sadness. To this day I want to help him. I don't know why. It's an obligation. I feel like my job isn't done, and you know what, the reality is, it probably never will be. No. For every person I attempt to help, there's five more, but I want to try. I'm not a licensed psychologist, I'm not much more than some random 20-something asshole who happens to browse Reddit, but I have a soft spot for those who struggle. I want so bad for them to realize that things aren't as bad as they seem. I want so bad for them to live. Live. I want so bad... to stop them from going through any of the things I went through. Do what I can. It's better than nothing.

...but when I saw this post by HalifaxG, I realized that my words are mostly meaningless. There's really no point to any of this. People are convinced that they are failures, and they cannot rise above the ashes. No, they were but a phoenix that burned out in the worst way possible, they can't come back.

I'm not entirely convinced that HalifaxG ultimately killed himself. A lot of people reach out with these posts as a plea for help, and I get it. You know what, I want to believe that's all this was. To this day, I want to believe that something clicked for HalifaxG, the man I never met, and most likely will never meet. To this day, I want to hope that HalifaxG, a man of mystery in my life and no real personal significance, just understands that things can be better. All you have to do is not quit. Never fucking quit. Your life depends on it.

And so, when I think about it. I realize that I'm probably getting too involved. All I want to do is help and sure, I'm an average guy for the most part. I have my own problems, I have my own issues, my own things going on, but... I feel more inclined to try and help others.

Halifax is not the only person I've helped. I've helped many, and some are friends to this day, the ""big gay brother I never had"", as they would tell me. I don't do it for recognition, I just want people to be happy. I'm asking for the impossible here. Some people I never hear from again, others, like Halifax, I only see continue to see negativity. They say that some people can't be helped. I don't want to believe that.

I really don't.

So my question to you, /r/askgaybros. Should I stop? Is this now doing more harm than good for me?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My first post ever on this account was 7 months ago. I remember it like it was yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to reach out and help people. Every day I would lurk on the &lt;a href=""/r/gay""&gt;/r/gay&lt;/a&gt; subreddit and see so many people struggling. I&amp;#39;m not a magician, but I figured I could at least try. That&amp;#39;s when I came across a post from a user named HalifaxG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/gay/comments/1vwftv/gay_and_ugly/""&gt;http://www.reddit.com/r/gay/comments/1vwftv/gay_and_ugly/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Halifax, you see, was a standard depressed individual. He felt outcasted. It wasn&amp;#39;t enough. Everyone gave him generic words of encouragement and while I&amp;#39;m not trying to come off as self-righteous, I can attest that &amp;quot;things get better, just hang in there&amp;quot; isn&amp;#39;t enough when you&amp;#39;re so far down in the dumps that your own value and self-worth comes under constant scrutiny -- from yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine you&amp;#39;re in a dark room. Something&amp;#39;s in this room with you, but you can&amp;#39;t see it. You hear it&amp;#39;s whispers. It&amp;#39;s words phase together into a garbled mess as if it speaks with five mouths, and through the nonsense it speaks you can decipher some words, words that tell you that you have failed. This thing, you try to get away from it, but you&amp;#39;re bumbling in the dark. You can&amp;#39;t outrun it. The sad part is that the room isn&amp;#39;t actually dark. In fact it&amp;#39;s not a room at all. You&amp;#39;re in a bright sunny field, there&amp;#39;s a tall oak tree with a wheel swing to the side, and it&amp;#39;s pure serenity, but you&amp;#39;re blind. You&amp;#39;re blind and you don&amp;#39;t know it, it all came so suddenly, that you think you&amp;#39;re confined and alone. You can almost hear the birds chirping, you can almost feel the suns rays, but the demon... he remains close. Is it any wonder it manages to remain so close when that demon isn&amp;#39;t a separate entity at all, but actually yourself?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was how I imagined Halifax. I&amp;#39;ve been there. A desperate and futile attempt to try and outrun oneself, I wanted to offer a helping hand the best way I could. I was gilded. I was praised. These things meant nothing. I wanted Halifax to see the light. I wanted Halifax to open his eyes. His words bothered me, the undertones written with sincere apathy. Couldn&amp;#39;t budge even if I pushed him, and I did try. I did try to push him. I tried with everything I could. I&amp;#39;ve never met this man. To this day I don&amp;#39;t know who he is, but I did not like what I was seeing none-the-less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...so Halifax stayed in mind. One of the first people I&amp;#39;ve helped and I&amp;#39;ve helped many since, but he was the first. He stuck out in memory. Today I was curious to know if HalifaxG ever made any more posts. I was convinced it was just a throwaway and I&amp;#39;d never see it again - in my mind I honestly wanted to believe he moved on and got better. Of course, I didn&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; believe that. These kinds of things don&amp;#39;t just go away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine my surprise then, when I see that HalifaxG did post! He posted in this very subreddit. Wow, I wonder what the topic was about...?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/2budnb/suicide/""&gt;http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/2budnb/suicide/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6 months later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6 months after the time I tried to help him, 6 months after the reaching out, the hand I offered to him, and the idea I truly wanted to believe where he actually took my hand, and rose himself up out of this pit, was gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt defeated, but worse so I felt an overwhelming sense of sadness. To this day I want to help him. I don&amp;#39;t know why. It&amp;#39;s an obligation. I feel like my job isn&amp;#39;t done, and you know what, the reality is, it probably never will be. No. For every person I attempt to help, there&amp;#39;s five more, but I want to try. I&amp;#39;m not a licensed psychologist, I&amp;#39;m not much more than some random 20-something asshole who happens to browse Reddit, but I have a soft spot for those who struggle. I want so bad for them to realize that things aren&amp;#39;t as bad as they seem. I want so bad for them to live. Live. I want so bad... to stop them from going through any of the things I went through. Do what I can. It&amp;#39;s better than nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...but when I saw this post by HalifaxG, I realized that my words are mostly meaningless. There&amp;#39;s really no point to any of this. People are convinced that they are failures, and they cannot rise above the ashes. No, they were but a phoenix that burned out in the worst way possible, they can&amp;#39;t come back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not entirely convinced that HalifaxG ultimately killed himself. A lot of people reach out with these posts as a plea for help, and I get it. You know what, I want to believe that&amp;#39;s all this was. To this day, I want to believe that something clicked for HalifaxG, the man I never met, and most likely will never meet. To this day, I want to hope that HalifaxG, a man of mystery in my life and no real personal significance, just understands that things can be better. All you have to do is not quit. Never fucking quit. Your life depends on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, when I think about it. I realize that I&amp;#39;m probably getting too involved. All I want to do is help and sure, I&amp;#39;m an average guy for the most part. I have my own problems, I have my own issues, my own things going on, but... I feel more inclined to try and help others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Halifax is not the only person I&amp;#39;ve helped. I&amp;#39;ve helped many, and some are friends to this day, the &amp;quot;big gay brother I never had&amp;quot;, as they would tell me.

Some people I never hear from again, others, like Halifax, I only see continue to see negativity. They say that some people can&amp;#39;t be helped. I don&amp;#39;t want to believe that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really don&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my question to you, &lt;a href=""/r/askgaybros""&gt;/r/askgaybros&lt;/a&gt;. Should I stop? Is this now doing more harm than good for me?&lt;/p&gt;

and now she moved across the country to live with this guy without saying goodbye or anything.

I'm a chubby guy (not muscular or bulky, just fat) and I am much interested in really short, really skinny men. I'm not particularly flirty, and I generally don't make it a point to judge guys (or anyone for that matter) about their ""stats"" or their looks. But anytime I've experienced attraction, it is always short, very thin guys. 

I'm 25 years old, 6'1"" tall, ~300 pounds. I've been in 2 long term relationships. The first was with a guy who was 5'7"" 115lbs. We met in middle school and were best friends for a few years and started dating when we were 9th grade. We dated for 6 years and broke up on good terms and are still friends. While in the relationship I was very content so I hardly even thought to look at other men. 

I was single for a year and doing my own thing before I met the second guy on Adam. He was 5'5"" 110lbs. We really connected over our business interests and became friends for a few months. We drunkenly hooked up one night and started dating soonafter. I was again very content in the relationship and didn't feel the need to look at other men in any sexual manner. I was friendly to everyone all the same. We broke up earlier this year. 

Last month, I was out furniture shopping for a new bed when I was greeted by the salesman. He was beautiful... I was immediately very attracted to him. He was probably about 5'5"" and definitely no more than 115 lbs. Maybe he saw my jaw drop or something but he was extremely flirty when showing me the beds I wanted to see. He would drop in a joke here and there such as how this bed would only work if my partner is light weight, and that if I wanted something more heavy duty I should look at THAT bed, etc. Overall we had a good time checking out the beds and I finally picked one and he rang me up for it. I told him I just bought a new house so I'll be slowly furnishing it. He took his business card and stapled it to the receipt, and wrote his cell number on it and said ""call or text me if you need anything else."" I caught on, I gave him my card and told him ""same to you."" He text me the next morning and he came over to hang out. Lets just say we had a good time. It was a very friendly encounter that I don't expect to turn into anything serious.

This was weird for me because its the first time someone has made an immediate effort to show interest in me. As I've explained my previous two relationships developed from friendships first and I feel the attraction stemmed from that more than anything. I haven't had much luck with random hookups outside of that. I've been questioning my attraction to him, because physically, he's similar to both of my exs who I was also very attracted to. Coincidence? 

I guess my point is, I am ""that guy"" who is attracted only to one body type, and statistically I have the worst odds. I know I've been lucky to have had two LTRs and a hookup with exactly the body type Im extremely attracted to, and I don't expect the poontang to come rolling in anytime soon. Most short, skinny guys aren't interested in guys my size. I've been casually dating and hooking up since then with all types of guys but I have not enjoyed any of it because I didn't feel attracted to these guys who were all taller and not super-thin. I am very positive that I am attracted to short, super-thin guys though. I would be content if I could just find one who is also interested in being in a relationship; I would rather settle down with what I am attracted to  than to keep hooking up and playing the field. Luck will either strike me again, or I will be forever alone.

How do you deal with mostly unrealistic attraction? I'm probably just overthinking it all.

For starters, I would like to live in a city when I'm older, whether it's LA, Boston, or NYC. As long as I'm away from here. I was a newspaper editor, which have me editing skills as well as experience with Adobe InDesign and Photoshop. I'm going to be taking an internship my second semester that will improve my skills with industry standard programs. I also learned that journalism is not my thing.  
  
I've taken many Myers-Briggs quizzes with plenty of time between them and I always get the ENFP personality type.  
  
My biggest problem right now is that I'm not passionate about anything. I keep feeling so much pressure having to choose some kind of career path even though I'm so young. How am I supposed to know? My friends have set plans for graduate schools or job placements, and I have nothing. I have lots of skills and lots of talent, but I don't know where to direct any of them.  
  
I've taken plenty of career tests in conjunction with the personality tests and I always get options like actor, musician, broadcast journalist, writer, teacher, party/event planner, magazine editor, arts manager, marketing, and similar options.  
  
What am I supposed to do? :-/  
  
Any help would be great and, hell, if you're an employer and think I would be a good fit for something you need, let me know. I'm open to almost anything that doesn't require graduate school as I am getting my bachelor's with no loans and want to keep that freedom.  
  
I also feel that although college has made me more educated and a better thinker, I feel that it hasn't prepared me for the real world as much as I wish it had. The future scares me...and I want to be spectacular at something and I know I can do great things, but I'm so lost and need guidance.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll be graduating this May, early because I&amp;#39;ve been taking a full load of credits over the summers.

&lt;p&gt;For starters, I would like to live in a city when I&amp;#39;m older, whether it&amp;#39;s LA, Boston, or NYC. As long as I&amp;#39;m away from here. I was a newspaper editor, which have me editing skills as well as experience with Adobe InDesign and Photoshop. I&amp;#39;m going to be taking an internship my second semester that will improve my skills with industry standard programs. I also learned that journalism is not my thing.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve taken many Myers-Briggs quizzes with plenty of time between them and I always get the ENFP personality type.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My biggest problem right now is that I&amp;#39;m not passionate about anything. I keep feeling so much pressure having to choose some kind of career path even though I&amp;#39;m so young. How am I supposed to know? My friends have set plans for graduate schools or job placements, and I have nothing. I have lots of skills and lots of talent, but I don&amp;#39;t know where to direct any of them.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve taken plenty of career tests in conjunction with the personality tests and I always get options like actor, musician, broadcast journalist, writer, teacher, party/event planner, magazine editor, arts manager, marketing, and similar options.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What am I supposed to do? :-/  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any help would be great and, hell, if you&amp;#39;re an employer and think I would be a good fit for something you need, let me know. I&amp;#39;m open to almost anything that doesn&amp;#39;t require graduate school as I am getting my bachelor&amp;#39;s with no loans and want to keep that freedom.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also feel that although college has made me more educated and a better thinker, I feel that it hasn&amp;#39;t prepared me for the real world as much as I wish it had. The future scares me...and I want to be spectacular at something and I know I can do great things, but I&amp;#39;m so lost and need guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

To provide a bit of context to why I am feeling this, I think I should explain my situation. 

Currently, I'm 19. When I was 15 I was sent by my mother to a therapeutic facility because she believed that my father's recent attempted suicide mixed with the bullying I faced due to feminine mannerisms that I had. At this time, I was obese. The facility was not faith-based nor was the intention to try and change my sexuality (but things similar to that did happen)

The supposed ""3-week"" stay in the facility turned into a 2 year venture across 4 states and 5 facilities. I experienced a lot of traumatic events in these places, mostly from other people there becoming hysterical and violent as well as abusive and homophobic staff. 

There was a silver lining to the situation, however. I lost over 100 pounds, 60 in the first 6 months. Despite the ridiculous cost of the facilities, we were extremely underfed. 

While there, I was diagnosed after testing with Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, and Borderline Personality Disorder. 

I came home in 2012 and was diagnosed with PTSD, due to the trauma from the facilities. (If you have any questions about the events or the facilities, feel free to ask). 

When I did come home, I couldn't have been more against psychiatry, therapy, as well as anything having to do with mental health. After doing some research on those who had the same opinion that I did, I found out about Scientology. 

For those who don't know, Scientology in its present form believes that psychiatry is basically responsible for everything evil that has ever happened. Salem Witch Trials? Psychiatry. Holocaust? Psychiatry. 

I then joined, and it engulfed a majority of my life for about 2 years. Also, I never joined the Sea Org, I never joined staff, and I never found out about aliens or anything like that while in. 

During this time, I went off my medications. Since I was taking 3 psychotropic drugs that have side effects for appetite suppression, I gained the weight back, and then some. 

Earlier this year, I had a dispute with Scientology about the way he charged my credit card without notifying me, and this caused me to do some research, and I ultimately left. 

Also, I understand now that Scientology is a cult. I understand now that they believe in a guy named Xenu. I understand now that I was gullible and trusted Scientology without diligent research. At this point, there is nothing someone could tell me about Scientology that I don't know. 

So, I got back on my medication when I left, but things have gotten far, far worse. 

When I first left, I developed an eating disorder and took 5-6 Dulcolax a day, and being unable to eat without the urge to purge what I had just eaten. After serious intervention from my mother and a doctor she recommended for me, I slowly weaned myself off of the laxatives and stopped purging. 

I can hardly survive without taking at least 3mg of Xanax every day. Even with it, I have so much anxiety about everything that I can hardly go out in public (except for class). 

The reason being is because I am so mortified and embarrassed about my weight. I cannot go out in public because I am terrified that I will see someone that I maybe knew when I skinnier, or that I will run into the only boyfriend I had and he will see that I am no longer skinny. 

I also have panic attacks because my doubts of Scientology and its teachings of past-lives and reincarnation have led me question whether or not there is any form of an afterlife. I try not to think about it, but someone will say something or something will remind me of it and I just go into a complete panic and the only way it is relieved is through Xanax.

I want to exercise, and I want to lose weight, but again I am terrified of someone recognizing me and seeing the weight I have gained in a gym or just on a sidewalk. 

I basically feel worthless because I am feeling worthless.  

I don't know why I am posting this, because I am not really asking anything, but at this point I really have no one to talk to. I have no friends from High School because I got my GED months after leaving facilities (because I would have had to retake courses), and everyone I knew in Scientology I can no longer speak to. 
 
I feel narcissistic and self absorbed for asking, but I would just really appreciate some advice on what to do, and general support. If anyone has any questions or misunderstandings about anything I have talked about, feel free to ask.

Lastly, I appreciate anyone who reads or comments. Any and all advice is greatly appreciated.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I apologize for the length in advance. &lt;/p&gt;
