I love playing with my prostate and things of that nature,. (This question might seem a bit gross but oh wells) However, every time I get my toy out and go to town, immediately after I feel the urge to defecate, when I do the only thing that comes out of me is some mucus with a bit of bright blood. 

The toy isn't large, 7"" long and it's slim. Just long enough to reach my prostate. There's no pain during ""me time"" or even after when I use the bathroom. My vowels act normal, I can use the bathroom fine, again I have no pain whatsoever in my anal region or stomach cramps or anything. Just some mucus and a bit of blood.. 

Any of you guys ever experienced anything like this? I don't even use my toy but maybe 1-2 times a month max. There also isn't any blood in my semen. I'm not too worried just curious why this may be happening.

**EDIT** I'm kind of new to the toy world. I've used my fingers before and this didn't happen.. And the first few times i used the toy this didn't happen. But the past few months every time after it has Happened.

**UPDATE!!!!!/EDIT!!** 

I completely forgot to mention that I have a history with Hemorrhoids as well as a small anal fissure but they occurred a while back. I know that sometimes blood and mucus can occur if you have Hemorrhoids. Is it possible that the toy may be irritating something in there??

I hang out with them pretty often because they live so close. One of them is getting married in a couple of months, and I agreed to be a groomsman. His about-to-be brother-in-law convinced us all to go to Vegas the weekend before, and as petty as it sounds I'm *terrified* he's going to get strippers involved.

The groom's pretty indifferent on gays, but his roommate (also a good friend of mine) has a more negative attitude. The problem is that I don't really know *how* negative it is, and I don't really want to open that can of worms right now if I can avoid it, especially since we'll all be moving away and on with our lives in the next few months.

So my dilemma is in how to handle the situation. If I come out to them, I want it to be before the trip; otherwise I feel like I'd be putting too much attention on myself when the weekend's about him. I won't have to come out to them at all if the in-law doesn't involve strippers, but there's no way he'll give me honest advance notice (if he's even decided yet): to him, all the fun would be in the surprise. But if he *does* decide to, there's no way I can avoid it without coming out to them - trust me on that aspect of our dynamic. And I'm pretty sure that a strip club experience will traumatize me. Not to mention I have no clue how to act at a strip club. I'm not exactly good at faking interest.

So what do you guys think? Take the risk in coming out? Risk the strippers instead? Roll with whatever happens and let the chips fall as they may?

I just need to get this off of my chest, so here goes: 

I have been Dating this guy for about 5-6 months now. we are both sophomores in college, and met at the beginning of the year. we have had a bit of a rocky relationship, at least from my viewpoint, because he has insisted on not using labels to define our relationship. he argues that labels like ""boyfriend"" really limit and can be toxic, and has even talked to me about poly-amory before. I have been the one struggling with the relationship, because this is my first real long term relationship, and i have been having difficulty with the idea of a non-traditional relationship. Like, i just haven't been sure what is okay and what is not okay. 

in general, we are overdue for an important talk where i am hoping to share these feelings with him, but we have been apart for the last month because of winter break and scheduling things. but, in that time, he sort of sensed that i was unsure about/hiding something, and when we were talking, he just reassured me that he was ""totally okay with me having sex with other people"". This took me by surprise, because i never agreed to being poly-amorous, and we had talked about it a while ago. (i still have to talk to him about it, i.e. overdue for talk)

Well, fast forward to today, where i find myself to be a very horny 19 yo college student, who hasn't had sex in a month and with very high stress levels. i open grindr, and one thing leads to another, next thing i know, i'm having sexy times with brazilian grad student in his apartment. :l 

So, i get out, and i feel awful. like i betrayed trust or something, even though my boyfriend told me himself he didn't mind me having sex with others. that, and hooking up with a complete stranger just felt hollow after having experienced sex with someone i was intimate with. i feel like i cheated, but the voice in my head keeps replaying my boyfriend saying ""i'm completely okay with you having sex with other people"" again and again to me. i guess what bothers me, is that before today, one of the things that i was going to say to him in our talk is that i wanted to be exclusive, because i don't think i am okay with him having sex with other people, but now i just feel like a hypocrite .

i know i need to talk to him, but i won't see him for like a week, and i don't know if i can wait that long to talk about it. and, how would i even start that conversation? 

**TL;DR** BF said i could have sex with other guys, went to poon city, now i feel dirty.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt; BF said i could have sex with other guys, went to poon city, now i feel dirty. &lt;/p&gt;

His response to that each time I've proposed it was that he needed an emotional connection to the person to have sex with them, and didn't seem interested in going outside of the relationship.

Issue: So, his ex-boyfriend of 3 years is down from out of state for about a week. They broke up on good terms. He has asked me if it is ok for the two of them to sleep together.

Not having thought about it before, now I was interested, so I did some research and I think my meatus (hole at the end of my penis) is too small, known as  [meatal stenosis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meatal_stenosis) or narrowing of the meatus.  I did some additional research ([here for example](http://joseph4gi.blogspot.ca/2014/04/guest-author-meatal-stenosis.html)) and sure enough, I seem to fit the profile and have most of the symptoms:

*I'm circumcised

*I measured with a ruler, and when closed, the vertical slit is barely 4-5mm

*The image at the bottom of that last article is a good approximation of the difference between me and my boyfriends dicks

*My urine stream is very strong, so much so that, embarrassingly, sometimes it sprays a little and I gotta wipe up the toilet seat (on the plus side, it's given us a laugh or two since when I cum I shoot really far; I've gotten it in my own and boyfriends hair before, while lying on my back)

*Emptying my dick completely after peeing is always difficult; no matter how much I try to 'milk' the last drops out, I invariably can't and get a small wet spot on my briefs which is also embarrassing.  The bottleneck created by the stenosis causes back pressure which results in the urine retention



Apparently, a meatotomy is the treatment: a doctor uses a hemostat to crush the spot at the bottom of the meatus, then uses scissors to snip the opening a couple mm wider.  I don't have a family doctor yet though, and I don't think I could just walk into a walk-in clinic and say ""I want a meatotomy!""  I supposed I could just live with it, but I'd like to get a meatotomy if all it takes is some discomfort at a doctor visit.



What do you guys think I should do?  Did I help anyone realize they might have it too?

He wasn't enjoying his job where had been with pretty much since the move and got an opportunity to switch companies through another coworker that was jumping ship. Two days in to the new job he said he felt like a storm was brewing inside of him and he was scared of the outcome. Day 3 of new job and he quit in order to focus on himself. 


For awhile he was doing really well by keeping himself busy at the gym, researching diets to help him out, etc. That slowed down towards the holidays as most of us were heading home, except for him. With his new financial situation and his rents coming to us for Thanksgiving, he didn't want to go home. 


Slowly but surely, the wall started to come up. By the time I got back he was deadpan and has been every single day. I try to initiate conversations with him but its one word responses and asks to be alone. After a little bit of this it will eventually turn in to a shouting argument between us where he feels that I'm just prying for information and he feels like I'm interrogating him. 


I tell him as his partner I want to be there for him and try to help him and that just makes him even more upset because he says I'm taking things too personally and that this is just something he has to internalize on his own time. 


My question is, do I just leave him be and let him continue to build up a wall for an indefinite amount of time? Because it's been a week now of near silence between us and my patience is starting to ware thin with this approach but anytime I try and broach the topic it ends in him leaving the apartment for solitude. His mom has been txting me asking if he is okay because he hasn't picked up their calls from them in days. I don't know how to respond because he said to leave it be and I'm afraid that if I tell her the truth than he's going to be even more upset with me and that I should mind my own business... even tho he is kind of is my business. 


This isn't the first time something like this has happened, but at that time he was on medication and seeing a therapist and I think it did help him. Lack of insurance currently isn't helping, but like I said, he's never liked being on meds.   


Sorry this is so long, but any advice on how to help him out with making him think it's his own idea would help. 


tl;dr: Boyfriend has been dealing with a bad lapse of depression, any advice on how to deal with it would help. 

Thanks

&lt;p&gt;Some background on me and my bf. I&amp;#39;m 23, he&amp;#39;s 26. Been together for 2.5 years, recently moved across the country once I finished up school exactly 1 year ago.

A cute guy messaged me, so I checked out his profile. I was happy to see that he had the same taste in music as I do, but I was immediately turned off when I saw that he listed his horoscope and said something like ""born under a rising moon.""

I basically told him that he was cute, but that there was no way I could even be friends with somebody who believes in astrology (and I might not have sounded so pleasant when I said it)... The next day, I felt bad about the way I treated him, so I was thinking about it some more. 

I think the reason I'm so anti-astrology is because it essentially just boils down to prejudice. All astrology does is ascribe attributes to somebody based on something they have no control over (namely, the time of their birth). 

And often, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. The attributes are so universal, that when you label somebody based on their horoscope, you'll start to pick out those traits that their horoscope ascribes to them, simply because *everybody* has those traits. Then that makes you assume that every person you meet will act in accordance to their horoscope.

This is something that I never ran into before coming out and entering the gay scene last year. I didn't think it was something people really *believed* in; I always thought it was more like the fortune in your cookie, its just a silly message meant to make you think. 

But I've seen it in a couple people's grindr profiles, and I've seen a couple posters on this forum mention horoscopes. Is there any reason why astrology is so popular in the gay community? Is this a legitimate deal-breaker for me to have?
