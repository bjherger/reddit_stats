I just wanted to send an update your way to my post a few months ago: http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/2nvnha/confused_straight_maybe_guy/

After a couple months of experimenting with guys, I actually discovered that I am indeed gay, I just needed to let those feelings come out and accept them. Once I did everything became clear. Dating is now fun for me and flirting doesn't seem like this rocket science that I don't understand. Everything is so clear for me now, I just passed my first hurdle and came out to my best friend/roommate. I completely underestimated how freeing and liberating this would be and fell 100% on top of the moon and so good about myself!

My boyfriend, let's call him Bill, and I have polar-opposite political beliefs.

If I'm honest, my disappointment with his political beliefs may make me come across as arrogant, but, at the same time, I want to talk about these things and Bill gets angry, shuts down and tells me I put him down for his beliefs. I feel like he gets the benefit of disagreeing with my opinion, but then won't explain why or discuss it with me.

I want people to tell me what they want to see more of :)

So, why would homosexuality be necessary - from a biological POV, again, not negating of being affirmative on religion.

Earlier today, this guy messages me with the standard ""hey what's going on? wanna hook up? blah blah"" and, having the house to myself I said yes. While asking what we want to do I explicitly said I don't really want to fuck but I'm fine sucking. He kept trying to coerce me into fucking but I just don't feel comfortable doing that. For one, I have no idea the other guys he's been with and what diseases he may (or may not) have and that feeling of uncertainty with random hookups turns me off to the entire thing. It's not that I'm putting down people for wanting to be sexual, but the few minutes of fun in my mind don't really outweigh the future implications. I don't know if this is old fashioned but I'd rather wait for the right guy to try anal with rather than some quickie hook up that's just hook up and go. 

At the same time, I know one of the things I've struggled with is getting out of my comfort zone and just diving into the metaphorical pool. Everyone has needs and sometimes it's fun to just give in to them for a little bit but even blowjobs sometimes get me paranoid about unpleasant STDs , so how much more for anal even if it is protected? So am I being too apprehensive about it all? On one hand it would be nice to just punch out that last card of ""holes where penises have been"", but at the same time I'd much prefer taking it slow with a guy I trust and not wasting my first time on some random 10 minute hook up.
