Let me preface this by saying I am not a psycho nor am I crazy conservative (I'm in the middle but more liberal on most things but w/e). However I do love guns, it is a passion I picked up as I got older (I do not come from a gun-owning family) and it is something I really like. I am involved in recreational competitive shooting as a hobby and I doubt that will be a problem for anyone but what I imagine could be in an issue for some is the fact that I'm always (legally) strapped. It's just something I like and it is my (and your!) right here in the USA to carry a gun if you're properly licensed. Sometimes I carry concealed in my backpack or something but lately I have been ""open carrying"" more and more (that means I wear it on my hip openly and anyone who can see me knows that I am armed). Basically the only place I do not have a gun on me is in places where they are banned like courthouses, post offices, schools etc. and I try to avoid businesses that ban firearms on their premises if I can. I got hassled once by the cops and I just showed them my documentation and reminded them of the law and I was fine. I live in a pretty large city in a liberal state and I have gotten a few looks of disapproval but no trouble really. I know the perception of gun owners is ""paranoid violent people"" but I'm not, I'm a totally normal person who is under no delusions that anyone is out to get me/that I'm fighting the govt etc. it is just something I think is cool and it is me exercising my rights the same as freedom of speech, religion, and voting.
I live in the Northeast in my hometown now but I loved down south for a couple of years while studying and that's where I got into it. I wasn't really dating and was very preoccupied then with school and taking care of an ailing relative so I didn't really date that much but now that I've started my career and I have some more free time it would be cool to meet someone. As a gay person in this world I have learned that it is important to never compromise your values and who you are and for me guns are a big part of that! 

My question is: (assuming we clicked obviously) would someone who carried a firearm be a deal breaker for you? Keep in mind most of the time I wear it openly throughout the day so if we were together it would be on me at Starbucks, the movies, at dinner, in the car, if we were hanging out at yours/my place etc. and the only time it is not on me is when my pants are off. Some people aren't cool with guns in their house and I respect that by not going into their house and if people aren't okay with being around guns I can respect them by avoiding them but rarely will I remove it (unless I'm in a place where it's banned like the post office etc.) and the only time it is concealed is when I'm at work and it's in my briefcase/backpack. Besides that it's attached to my hip, literally lol.


I'm a 25 year old normal architect and a pretty decent, normal and well rounded person.

What do you think? Is an armed person something that scares you and is a turn off? Something that you would need to be explained and reassured about (IMO that's fine and understandable)? Or is it a non-issue?

Also, should I put this fact about me on my OKC profile so that my date doesn't freak out when I show up at Starbucks armed?

For the record I live in America obviously so this question doesn't apply to guys in other countries..

And dreading even more so having to tell my parents in the morning.

I've known that hemorrhoids are swolen blood vessels in the anus for a while, but I still didn't have a practical knowledge of them until a few minutes ago.

When I have sex, most of the time I end up bleeding a bit. And most of the time when I wipe after making a bowel movement, the TP is redder than a Ferrari. I just thought I had a sensitive ass. 

Well, I know sometimes after a painful bowel movement or after sex I feel a soreness in my ass for a while. Again, I never really related this to hemorrhoids because I'm a naive dumbass.

So tonight while watching a Mormon twink getting railed, rubbing my crotch like I do every night, having not made a bowel movement or been penetrated by anything at all today, I noticed my asshole was sore. I stuck my finger on it and noticed a lump. I've felt the lump before but never paid it any mind, thinking it was normal. Tonight it hit me like a big yellow schoolbus. ""Wait.. IS THAT A FUCKING HEMORRHOID?""

I did a Google image search (semi-regretting that now, after seeing several big, purple, puckered, poop chutes) and confirmed my suspicion. 

Since my extremely long and unnecessary backstory is over...

What. the. fuck. should. I. do?

Is it important I contact a doctor asap?

Can I continue doing anal? Is it dangerous?

I'm getting this sensation, like a deep cold sweeping from my heart to the very pit of my stomach that makes me want to cry. And I'm starting to come close due to all this panicking. I feel like a big baby and I want to go bury my face in my mom's shoulder and cry like a little bitch.

And any other information I didn't ask for is very welcome and EXTREMELY WANTED!

I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask... but I didn't want to go to a support forum because I didn't want to talk about the abuse. I wanted to talk to people who are actually getting out there and doing amazing things. From what I've seen, this forum is full of those people.

As the title says; I left my abusive parents. Long story short: everything I did was wrong, and everything I did wrong was a good reason to beat me and humiliate me.

Honestly, I just don't know what to do. The possibilities have opened wide for me, but I still feel helpless. That feeling of helplessness is common among victims of abuse...  it's part of what keeps us from leaving, among other things.

I've been trained to be passive, but I need to start learning how to be more proactive or I'm just not gonna make it in life. I need to beat this; I know I can. But I feel like I need help... a push of some kind. I don't want my history to haunt me forever.

I'm actually a really good looking guy, and really smart... but it's hard to keep those things in perspective when my self-image has been so distorted. Thankfully, that's been improving.

Anyhow, any advice would be appreciated. Thanks everyone.

&lt;p&gt;As the title says; I left my abusive parents. Long story short: everything I did was wrong, and everything I did wrong was a good reason to beat me and humiliate me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I just don&amp;#39;t know what to do. The possibilities have opened wide for me, but I still feel helpless. That feeling of helplessness is common among victims of abuse...  it&amp;#39;s part of what keeps us from leaving, among other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been trained to be passive, but I need to start learning how to be more proactive or I&amp;#39;m just not gonna make it in life. I need to beat this; I know I can. But I feel like I need help... a push of some kind. I don&amp;#39;t want my history to haunt me forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m actually a really good looking guy, and really smart... but it&amp;#39;s hard to keep those things in perspective when my self-image has been so distorted. Thankfully, that&amp;#39;s been improving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, any advice would be appreciated. Thanks everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: I have to sleep now. I&amp;#39;ll check my answers tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

We wound up going to a bar after we left the dinner and then eventually back to my place. Next thing I know, we spent the entire 4 day weekend together.

He's fantastic: smart, sexy, funny, sweet, etc. I really like him and I know he really likes me too. Everything is perfect except for one thing: I'm 26 and he's 44.

We talked about it a couple times over the course of the weekend and  sort of came to an understanding that the age difference was just too much, but I'm kind of torn inside.

People would think it's weird, my parents would probably never accept it, he'd die 20 years before I do if we wound up staying together, and I honestly do think it's a little weird myself.

That doesn't stop me from thinking about him nonstop, though. I just don't know what to do. I'm fairly certain that, despite us discussing not being together, if I told him with certainty and gravitas that I wanted to pursue a relationship, he'd agree to it.

Essentially, over Thanksgiving break, I met up with this guy while both of us were back visiting our parents. It was a great first date, albeit a short one. There was never any situation where it was awkward and the conversation flowed very well and everything. However, unfortunately, I had to go back to school and he had to go back to work, but both of us expressed interest in meeting up and hanging out again when both of us are around, which happens to be Christmas break/New Years.

My question is what should I do in the meantime? My thought is that I want to stay in touch, but I don't want to come off as annoying or clingy. I know I have a tendency to get attached too quickly, and I'm actively trying to avoid that. However, this guy seems cool and, while it'd be absurd to expect anything from now, I want to keep in touch with him at least a little bit, rather than having 3 weeks of complete and utter silence. How often would be a good baseline to talk? 

While we aren't incredibly far apart when I'm at college and he's at work (less than 2 hours or so), I recognize it's likely too early for either of us to go and travel to visit the other, especially with finals happening for me. So yeah.

I'm a 24 year old gay dude, a somewhat stereotype nerd who doesn't go out to party, never been drunk, rarely hanging out with people IRL, very introverted maybe even bordering social anxiety.


That being said, I don't really have any friends due to me being a very withdrawn person. When I was 16 I started hanging out alot on the internet and made friends there since it was much easier to talk to people. As a quite stupid naive person I thought I wouldn't find any local bf and got instead into silly internet romances. Around 17 I had been playing a MMORPG and met my current bf. We started beings friends at first for around a year before I decided that I wanted it to be something serious. (I feel like I should be embarassed). I then made up a huge lie to my family in order to meet him. (They don't know I'm gay) It was the most awsome 2 weeks in my life, never having had any intimate relationship before it was indescribable. After the visit, I came out to my sisters who were quite shocked that I went abroad to meet someone I never met before (crazy I know). They accepted me without any question, but didn't want me to do it again. 


My bf is 7 years older than me so he had a steady job back then. After around a year he lost his job which made it impossible for him to pay a trip to see me, in fact, he never visited me (due to me not being out to my family). When it was time for me to graduate (~1 year after my first visit) wanted to give me a graduation present. I made up yet another lie in order to visit my bf. My sisters found out and wouldn't allow me to go. I then had to make a deal with them that I must not visit him anymore until he visits me.


Here I am today, in a distance relationship which amounts to around 7 years. I haven't seen him for 4-5 years. Accumulated physical time spent together, around 3 weeks. Sick right? I don't know how I was able to cope with it. I think I simply managed to bury my sadness and 
longing deep inside of me.


To make this matter a bit more complicated, my bf has [AvPD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avoidant_personality_disorder), meaning he has among other things strong social anxiety. At multiple occasions he told me to leave him and to find someone else, but I simply never had the heart to do it. Leaving him would have confirmed his negative thoughts ""I'm ugly, useless, worthless, etc"" and it felt like, if I had done so, I would have backstabbed my believe that love can overcome anything. I know I must sound like a retard, but I always hoped that I could help him live a happy life, with me. 


Just thinking about what he would do or how lonely he would be pained me. Some days ago, I finally went to a gaythemed movienight where I for the first time in my life, met a group of LGBT people. It was a rather small group, but it was a nice experience. I also met a very outgoing and social guy there who I befriended. It felt easy to talk to him, so I told him about my relationship and other gay things I never talked about IRL. He said that the relationship I had was not true love. That it's not possible to have true love over a distance since it doesn't build on a solid physical ground. It later also turned out that he was also hitting on me, which simply felt surreal to me.


Anyhow. I know that this seems or might be a doomed relationship. There aren't any plans at all in the future, but the retarded hopeless romantic me still sees a silverlining at the end of it. I know all that, and I still can't abandon my bf. As I wrote earlier I had burried all my feelings deep inside of me, and whenever I think about leaving him, it all comes up, and I feel like shit. I feel like the worst for even thinking about leaving him. At the same time I feel attracted to the guy I just met, and I feel like it's wrong to be that way. It's wrong to even think about it. I feel horrible for not feeling that I could resist physical intimacy.


My relationship with my current boyfriend, it became a part of my life. Exchanging a few messages every day. I was happy with that. I had times where I was thinking about if I was doing the right thing, and I always ended up saying ""It's fine the way it is now, there's no need to change anything"". Even now I think that I might just go with that.


I feel like shit now. I don't even know what I'm supposed to ask you. It's such a long text, I won't blame anyone for not having the energy to read so much shit. Heck I even feel like you should call me shit for thinking about intimacy with another guy while in a relationship. Argh.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;First about myself.

I'm sorry for the wall of text, I really needed to get this all out. 

Today, I really messed up. 

So it started out as a normal day, breakfast with the family, followed by my routine Sunday lonely time (aka browsing reddit). But today wasn't just any normal Sunday, my parents were going to be out during the afternoon and night, so I had made plans! And so I waited patiently, until that moment came, the doorbell rings and there she is, my beautiful (and also secret) girlfriend. To my parents, she was just my best friend, the typical high school duo. But to me, she is more than just that, she's my everything. But of course I couldn't let my parents know this, because they were strict Catholics who would definitely not approve.

Soon after Jen's (we'll call her that) arrival, my parents left for their scheduled outings, leaving Jen and I roughly four hours alone. Now I know what you're thinking: ""Four hours?! How could this possibly go wrong with such a big time window?"" And trust me at the time I was thinking the exact same thing. 

Soon after my parents were gone Jen and I were at it, doing things that normal horny lesbians do to each other, but no sex yet. After our little makeout session we decided we were tired. It all started to go south when we decided to take a nap together. Our makeout session and nap took a cool 3 hours, leaving us about an hour for the fun stuff. We figured that was enough time for us to finish. Boy were we wrong. 10 minutes in, my parents are standing at my doorway, with a horrified look on their face as they see me, fully nude, screaming, Jen's head in between my legs. My mother bursts into tears. I glance over to check the disturbance and immediately shriek and reach for the nearest thing to cover myself with, and Jen does the same. We hang our heads in shame as my parents slowly walk towards their room, quietly asking themselves what they've just witnessed and if it's real or not. I apologize to Jen and get dressed and begin the walk of shame to my parents room, where they are praying. When they see me, they stop and they just look at me, with such a disappointed look that I immediately began to sob. They yelled at me. They told me that there was something wrong with my head. They told me that they don't want to see me, to find someone else to take care of me. They told me, ""pack up your valuables, here's $300, leave."" And that was it. Jen called her parents and told them what happened and they gladly welcomed me into their home. I'm thankful for them but I don't want to be a burden to them. Please reddit, I'm begging for any help you can give, I'm totally lost and have no idea what to do. I'm sorry for the wall of text, I'm currently on my phone and just needed to get this out. 

TL;DR  - am gay, catholic parents were out, secret girlfriend was over, catholic parents come back early to find daughter getting eaten out by secret girlfriend, now am hated by parents and living with girlfriend please help.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;After posting this on the teenagers sub I was advised to bring this here for advice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sorry for the wall of text, I really needed to get this all out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I really messed up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it started out as a normal day, breakfast with the family, followed by my routine Sunday lonely time (aka browsing reddit). But today wasn&amp;#39;t just any normal Sunday, my parents were going to be out during the afternoon and night, so I had made plans! And so I waited patiently, until that moment came, the doorbell rings and there she is, my beautiful (and also secret) girlfriend. To my parents, she was just my best friend, the typical high school duo. But to me, she is more than just that, she&amp;#39;s my everything. But of course I couldn&amp;#39;t let my parents know this, because they were strict Catholics who would definitely not approve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon after Jen&amp;#39;s (we&amp;#39;ll call her that) arrival, my parents left for their scheduled outings, leaving Jen and I roughly four hours alone. Now I know what you&amp;#39;re thinking: &amp;quot;Four hours?! How could this possibly go wrong with such a big time window?&amp;quot; And trust me at the time I was thinking the exact same thing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon after my parents were gone Jen and I were at it, doing things that normal horny lesbians do to each other, but no sex yet. After our little makeout session we decided we were tired. It all started to go south when we decided to take a nap together. Our makeout session and nap took a cool 3 hours, leaving us about an hour for the fun stuff. We figured that was enough time for us to finish. Boy were we wrong. 10 minutes in, my parents are standing at my doorway, with a horrified look on their face as they see me, fully nude, screaming, Jen&amp;#39;s head in between my legs. My mother bursts into tears. I glance over to check the disturbance and immediately shriek and reach for the nearest thing to cover myself with, and Jen does the same. We hang our heads in shame as my parents slowly walk towards their room, quietly asking themselves what they&amp;#39;ve just witnessed and if it&amp;#39;s real or not. I apologize to Jen and get dressed and begin the walk of shame to my parents room, where they are praying. When they see me, they stop and they just look at me, with such a disappointed look that I immediately began to sob. They yelled at me. They told me that there was something wrong with my head. They told me that they don&amp;#39;t want to see me, to find someone else to take care of me. They told me, &amp;quot;pack up your valuables, here&amp;#39;s $300, leave.&amp;quot; And that was it. Jen called her parents and told them what happened and they gladly welcomed me into their home. I&amp;#39;m thankful for them but I don&amp;#39;t want to be a burden to them.
