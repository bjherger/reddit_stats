First I wanted to thank all of you for taking the time to respond to my previous post: http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/2669pm/finding_a_fwb_when_im_overweight/.

He's agreed to go as slow as I need to help me explore my sexuality. We're planning on meeting up next weekend. Looking forward to it. Thanks guys.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys,&lt;/p&gt;

Feel free to comment or pm any questions. tldr below

And I'm just realizing now that watching the characters counter go up as I write is really distracting yet mesmerizing at the same time. Is it obvious I'm new?

Anyways, I've been out to a number of friends now, started coming out over a year ago so starting to get more comfortable with that and most my close friends know. My family on the other hand is very different. My dad I know is very homophobic, tonnes of homophobic slurs and open statements against it so that's going to be a blast. Conversely, my mom is a blank slate and makes very few comments on anything social issues. (This leads me to want to attempt bringing it up to test the waters but I don't know how she'll react and if she'll tell my dad)

My plan was basically to tell my mom first, this summer while my dad went on a trip for a while. He was originally going to do the trip much later in summer but it was moved a lot earlier so if I want to do this choice, I'll have to tell my mom very soon. Conversely, since I'm still financially dependent on my family (actually heading off to college) I thought i would (if i decided to) tell my dad at the end of summer (or close to). I have a brother too who I dont know how he stands but I wont see him in person for a long time and I'm more of an 'in person' person.

Basically just looking for some tips and advice in this situation. I'm also trying to justify to myself why I want to come out to them since it is very risky. It might be partly because of the pang in my stomach when my parents make an assumption or bc i dont want them finding out through any other means outside of me and the more i open to my friends the bigger of a risk that becomes. So any realizations about why any of you guys decided to come out would be cool too.

I apologize if this is relatively vague. Feel free to ask Qs.

We've been together for a year and a half and he is my first boyfriend. He is in his 40's I am 28. I do love him and he loves me. Lately my love and sexual attraction is a little less while his intensify. 

He tells me every time we encounter an open couple that he says he never would do that. I understand that and respect it. Last night after a night of drinking, he said that again and I told him I don't agree. He was shocked because I never told him. He can't wrap his mind around why I would want to be in a relationship, but sleep around. This morning, he asked me how we could fix this. The concept of an open relationship is hard for him and may never be ok with him. I ended it because I can't see myself with only one person right now. In my mind, I was just trying to prevent the more intense feeling of heartbreak later on. 

What do you guys think?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I broke up with my boyfriend this morning and I&amp;#39;m feeling like an asshole. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve been together for a year and a half and he is my first boyfriend. He is in his 40&amp;#39;s I am 28. I do love him and he loves me. Lately my love and sexual attraction is a little less while his intensify. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He tells me every time we encounter an open couple that he says he never would do that. I understand that and respect it. Last night after a night of drinking, he said that again and I told him I don&amp;#39;t agree. He was shocked because I never told him. He can&amp;#39;t wrap his mind around why I would want to be in a relationship, but sleep around. This morning, he asked me how we could fix this.

Men's fitness magazines seem pretty homoerotic.  Is it because of their history as crypto-gay porn?  Has straight culture been permanently influenced by decades of consumption of gay porn?  Or is it because men cultivating their bodily aesthetics is inherently homoerotic?

Sorry for the long, rambly post but I have to get this off my chest somehow or I'm bound to explode.  I've never talked to anyone about my true sexuality before but I know I need to and this is hopefully the first step.  I've been reading a lot of posts on here lately and it has inspired me to hopefully change my life for the better and accept who I am.  The community here seems really supportive so it seemed like a good place to post this. 

I'm a slightly older guy (29) who has finally come to terms with being gay.  I had deluded myself into thinking that I was bi since I was a teenager but my few sexual experiences with women suggest that I'm not.  I feel some attraction towards women but it when it comes to actually having sex with them the it just doesn't feel right.  I've been in two relationships with women, both about a month and my last sexual experience with a woman was almost 4 years ago which didn't go all that well.  Since then I've been single just kind of pretending I'm in a dry spell when I'm not pursuing any sexual relationships with women at all.

I've known that I am attracted to men since I was a teenager, but I never acted on it until a few months when I finally had an encounter with a guy I met online which went reasonably well, we had mutual oral and I really enjoyed it.  I was nervous but it felt more natural than any of my previous sexual experiences.  This pretty much confirmed to me that I'm gay which I've known deep down all along but have just denied it.  Also, I strongly prefer gay porn to straight porn which was a pretty strong indicator of my gayness the whole time.

Now that I've come to terms with being gay, I know that I need to come out but I'm having a hard time with it.  There's no huge reason that I can't come out, I live in a gay friendly city and will be moving to another one this fall.  I think my friends and family will be mostly supportive although some may take some time to come around to the idea.  I think the reason I haven't come out is due to me and not the people around me.  This just makes me feel shitty about the whole situation.  I feel like I've been lying to everyone I know for 10+ years and that I'm a coward for not being able to come out sooner.  Theres so many people much younger than me and in much more difficult situations that have managed to come out that I'm kind of embarrassed that I haven't found the strength to do it myself.  Also, I'm pretty insecure about my lack of sexual experience for a 29 year old which I think adds to my anxiety about coming out sine I feel like I'm so far behind as far as my sexual development goes.   
 
I realize that this is r/askgaybros and I haven't asked a question yet. I'd love to get any input from you guys, especially guys that came out older but any input is welcome.  I just really needed to say some of these things.  Some questions I have are: What was it that finally gave you the courage to come out after such a long time?  How do did you get over the guilt of lying to everyone?  How did you get over being sexually inexperienced at a later age?  

Thanks in advance for reading and any advice you guys might have.

Senior in college and I'm still a virgin. I've made out with some guys before, but that's it. The only idea of sex I have is from porn, so it's made me feel inferior and disgusting when I compare my bodies to theirs. I'm not ripped or hung (I'm 4"", so that's part of my anxiety)…and even if a guy I like isn't super good looking anyway I still feel like I won't be good enough for him. I want to have fun…and I'm lonely…but my insecurities are like a mental roadblock.  
  
I look around at the gay people in real life at school I know and then look at the guys in gay porn or on magazines…they all seem to be so hot, athletic, and they all gossip about who is hung or not. It's one thing to say that people in porn and magazines are photoshopped, but then I see people who really do look like that in real life and I feel inferior. I feel like I want to wait until I achieve my dream body to have sex.  
  
I'm afraid that no one will ever want me sexually or romantically. I'm so afraid of being alone. A part of me thinks I just need to put myself out there and get it over with. Another part of me tells me to give up and accept I will always be alone.  
  
It sounds dramatic, but this is how I feel. I'm so sick of hearing about how women have it bad with media representations. They completely deny that men face the same exact issues just as intensely…
