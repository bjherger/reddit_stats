A bit of back story, I met my currently first boyfriend about a month and a half ago, and have been dating for a month. That being said I am completely head over heels for this man. He's everything I've wanted and have been looking for..

Now here's where the opportunity comes into play, my bf races formula three over in Europe. Unfortunately he will be staying there for the next 6 months starting in May. He wants to bring me with him. Now this sounds like a fantasy, I've never been outside of the country and now my Prince Charming is offering to take me. My first answer was clearly yes, but the more I think about it, the more I can tell my parents are going to call me crazy.

I am currently a college sophomore, and I'm planning on taking online classes If I were to move for the 6 months. However, I have not a clue how to bring this up to my parents.

Gaybro from Melbourne, Australia here.

I'm going to be travelling through Europe by myself from June 26-August 13 more or less and was looking for some travel tips/suggestions.

I'm booking everything myself, but I barely know anything about the places I'm going so I need some help! I'll be Eurailing it through for the most part, and be in the following cities with the approximate timeframes:

London: 4-5 days
Paris: 3-4 days
Italy (Florence, Rome Venice): I imagine this will take the better part of 2 weeks.

This leaves me with around 4-5 days during which I hope to fly to Amsterdam, and then train my way to Frankfurt, Germany towards the end of August, where I'll be meeting my parents to travel with them for another 2 weeks.

I know it's peak season but it's literally the only time I've got to travel between graduation and work as I'm going to be starting work (optometrist) in Perth, WA in August.

I have a fair bit of money saved up but I'm obviously not rolling in cash and would like to avoid excess expenditure wherever possible. Backpacking isn't really part of the plan.

I haven't actually booked anything yet unfortunately :( I only just got the OK for dates a little over a week ago so it's been a bit of a mad rush to try and get things organised.

I'm pretty big on nightlife and I really enjoy quiet hipster-y bars/cafes/restaurants and all that shit but also like cool landscapes and sightseeing tourist stuff so I'm basically open to anything in terms of stuff to do. What I really wanted help with was the kinds of areas to stay!

Help me gaybros! And ask away for more details, I'm happy to elaborate.

Edit: I'll add that I'm an optometry student and I'll be starting work in August. As part of my new job I get a sizeable sign-on bonus and, as previously mentioned, I've a lot of money saved up from slaving away during my school/uni years.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yo!

I had a quick question that some may consider lame.

First some background. I am in the closet and 16. OK onto the question:

I was at a party tonight and like 5 of us went to a separate room to play Truth or Dare. Another guy (straight (or in the closet) was dared to kiss me and we did. It was just a second long, and it wasn't meaningful, but does it count as a kiss?

If it does, it was my first kiss and I'm pretty torn up about it. I wanted my first kiss to be meaningful, and with someone that shares mutual feelings with me. While I do have feelings for this particular person, the kiss was not meaningful and (as far as I know) he doesn't have mutual feelings for me.

Words of advice/ comments?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi &lt;a href=""/r/AskGayBros""&gt;/r/AskGayBros&lt;/a&gt;. I had a quick question that some may consider lame.&lt;/p&gt;

But then I realized that I don't even know what the risk REALLY is for me specifically (how about when I get a sore, what about just rubbing my dick on him etc etc. Every imaginable question that could occur in a relationship).

About the scenario: I'm a top, I only ever have safe sex, he's medicated and his viral load is below detection (so he says).

Ok, well I got him to admit he was nervous and that's why he flaked. Still wants another chance real bad. hmm hmm.

I am sorry if I offend anyone, but I just need to let this all out.

I absolutely hate being gay, I hate it more than anything in the world. I feel like I'm in a bubble of my own looking out at everyone living happy straight lives. My god how I envy straight people. I look at them with such adoration, how they were born the way Mother Nature intended it to be. I feel so miserable watching how perfect it looks to me, a man and woman together, the way it's always been through time, the way we all came to be.

Nobody knows that I am gay. I live in a very homophobic family and I doubt my friends would accept me. Just so god tortures me more  I live in the most gay friendly city on the planet, New York City. 

All I think about is how dreadful the future will be when I start to see my friends getting married and having children while I'm left out on my own like I always am. How will I continue to keep this secret in the future? Every single happy moment of my life, in the back of my head, I remember that I am gay and instantly I know this happiness won't ever last. 

My parents, my friends, everyone in my life, it's all just fake. If they ever knew I was gay they would treat me differently. I would always be that ""gay"" friend. I envy them so much, how normal they are. They don't need to carry this kind of burden. Hell, I've built such a straight life around me that nobody would even believe me if I came out.

I feel like if I were straight, I would be a whole person. I never function as well as I can. I never truly smile like I mean it. 

The worst part is that I've entered into relationships with girls, they would start off strong, but after awhile I would be so consumed with guilt about secretly lying to them I would put less and less effort into the relationship because I figured it's all fake anyway, and Im not normal no matter how normal I seem when I have a girlfriend. In the beginning though, it feels SO perfect.

I hate your sex obsessed culture, I hate your ""sassy gay"" way of talking, I hate your vanity, I don't want to be part of it! I'm not a twink! Or a bottom! Or a top!

I hate that I don't see men as romantic partners, only sexual ones. I hate anal sex, I hate how I feel after masturbating to gay porn. I hate that there is no light at the end of the tunnel. I'm 21 years old, I want to be out meeting girls, having fun, living life. Gay people are such a small percentage of the population, WHY the hell did I have to end up this way?

I'm a good looking guy and I always try to be myself when I meet a guy but being myself seems like it's never good enough for more than 3 dates. The worst part is I always feel like it's cool , like I'm having a good time with the guy and he's enjoying his time too.

I'm usually a pro when it comes to first dates, I go there confident, and usually give a good impression, the guy usually texts me right away to tell me he wants to see me again. I keep seeing the guy and all of a sudden he just gets distant and I get dumped.

I was just seeing this guy, he'd text me handsome everyday and ask me for another date. All the dates we went on were awesome, snowboarding, bowling, movies, cuddling, ranchy sex, and then boom , nothing!! Today I find out he met someone else while seeing me . Wtf? I didnt see this one coming

How the hell do u deal with constant rejection without it affecting your self esteem?

I'm going though a down period.

I feel comfortable with myself, and I  much less anxiety when meeting guys and what turns me on. Which is good, because if I imagine a date with the opposite it would be difficult unless she was perfect. 

So, I have several unpleasant experiences recently...

1) I had been chatting with an older man, who was very pleasant, upbeat and respectful in our chats. I needed to take a day for a late appt, so we decided to meet at my place. This the first time I've ever invited a stranger to meet for a hookup, male or female. So, I was a little nervous. He gets here, we kiss move to the bed to start to fool around. He is a pleasant but an insistent guy. LTDR; I am GGG, but I end up peeing in his mouth a little, thinking he was going to blow me after I repeatedly and politely declined golden showers. Earlier he also wanted me to fuck him with my dildo. So, I put a condom on it and he objects and wonders why I want to put a towel under his bum as well. All very pleasantly though. Then,  unexpectedly, my property manager shows up. I want to conclude because of that and the totality of what I mentioned. I tell a gay friend this and that I blew him. He chided me for completing that action. He told me the guy was a user and couldn't respect boundaries. 

2) Another older man too, is very pleasant and respectful to talk to. We meet after a lull in the snow. I meet him a subway terminal near him, not near me. I get in his car, he complains that it was difficult to get here and we should have met near me. I apologized, and told I thought I was doing him a favor by not making to drive him into town. He then asks what we should do... I tell him, I don't know maybe get something to eat. I figured he'd have this covered since he owns a restaurant and would know where to  go. I tell him I did not want to insult by suggesting Chili's or BK. The dude is way surly, complains about where we met and then remarks how it works only for me? Then he says his blood pressure is rising and asks me to leave. So, I do. 

3) I was chatting with a younger guy and he wanted to meet up at my place. I don't pay for any sites, so in the past I've told this dude to get a throwaway email address so we can chat. He does not.  He also blew me off once. But I figure, stuff happens., whatever.  We chat again, he wants to meet at my place. I tell him I need a face pic because I don't want a stranger coming to my house. He never replies back. 

Now, perhaps, I've done some things you may not agree with; but I am feeling my way along. I'm older, so I don't have the easier environment of college or going to bars every night. 

Am I an idiot for thinking people over 30, 40 or 50...should be more responsible...? Am I wrong to meet someone 'age-appropriate'? I'm 47. Maybe I should meet younger guys, could they be more mature?

Backstory:

In elementary school i never felt anything for girls, never had a crush, i had to pull a name out of my ass when someone asked me if i had a crush/liked any girl.

middle school/puberty: 7th grade, wham, huge crush on a guy. I went through this period of confusion and strange emotion. For example i remember thinking that i could just act straight and get a wife and die a closet case or something. I continued to deny it. One night it all boiled over and i flat out admitted it to myself, that i was gay. I remember crying (because for some reason this was the worst thing that could happen to me) and then going to bed. 

The next day i thought that it was just a phase and that i might straighten out when i was 15 or 16, so i decided to put it off until then.

so i just didn't think about it until the very end of 10th grade, when the notion occurred to me that i might not even be attracted to girls. 

heres the thing: Up to that point, i'd been interested in pretty much all types of porn (straight, lesbian, gay, shemale). I would usually flip flop my porn habits, i would watch lesbian or straight (which was almost exclusively anal) porn for a while, then watch gay for a period of time. 

after this realization it seemed like my desire for straight porn dropped off, almost artificially as if my mind somehow forced it.

Anyways, i thought that there was a very real possibility i didn't really find women attractive. For whatever reason i fully accepted this notion. It felt like i was ""free"". But there always was (and is) this nagging feeling that im wrong in my self assesment, and that its just a ""phase"" or a kink or something.

TL;DR: There's a part of me that says/thinks i'm gay, and another part that tells me i'm a faker or that i *want* to be gay for attention or something. This has been going on for like 3 or 4 years now.

Usually the thought that i'm not gay coincides with periods when i feel depressed or lack motivation.

helppp","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;this might end up being pretty long, also sorry about the grammar, i&amp;#39;m just writing this up and not really trying to be proper. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Backstory:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In elementary school i never felt anything for girls, never had a crush, i had to pull a name out of my ass when someone asked me if i had a crush/liked any girl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;middle school/puberty: 7th grade, wham, huge crush on a guy. I went through this period of confusion and strange emotion. For example i remember thinking that i could just act straight and get a wife and die a closet case or something. I continued to deny it. One night it all boiled over and i flat out admitted it to myself, that i was gay. I remember crying (because for some reason this was the worst thing that could happen to me) and then going to bed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day i thought that it was just a phase and that i might straighten out when i was 15 or 16, so i decided to put it off until then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so i just didn&amp;#39;t think about it until the very end of 10th grade, when the notion occurred to me that i might not even be attracted to girls. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;heres the thing: Up to that point, i&amp;#39;d been interested in pretty much all types of porn (straight, lesbian, gay, shemale). I would usually flip flop my porn habits, i would watch lesbian or straight (which was almost exclusively anal) porn for a while, then watch gay for a period of time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;after this realization it seemed like my desire for straight porn dropped off, almost artificially as if my mind somehow forced it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, i thought that there was a very real possibility i didn&amp;#39;t really find women attractive. For whatever reason i fully accepted this notion. It felt like i was &amp;quot;free&amp;quot;. But there always was (and is) this nagging feeling that im wrong in my self assesment, and that its just a &amp;quot;phase&amp;quot; or a kink or something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: There&amp;#39;s a part of me that says/thinks i&amp;#39;m gay, and another part that tells me i&amp;#39;m a faker or that i &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to be gay for attention or something. This has been going on for like 3 or 4 years now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually the thought that i&amp;#39;m not gay coincides with periods when i feel depressed or lack motivation.&lt;/p&gt;

So I only just recently joined the 21st century and got a smart phone. Previously I'd used online dating a couple of times, but access to apps means that I'm getting into all kinds of dating apps I didn't have access to before. 

I'm a bit of an old fashioned guy. Not like Log Cabin Republican old fashioned but I've never been the kind of sleep around a lot. On these apps I've said in my profile that I'm looking for long term relationships (not that anyone reads the profiles though, right?). 

Anyway, I've started talking to this guy on Tindr who I really hit it off with and we messaged each other back and forth for a day or two. We scheduled a date for tonight several days ago, and then exchanged phone numbers. I told him I was going to a friend's for a couple of drinks and movie, and low and behold half way through the movie he sent me a pic of his boner. Now, he still had it in the underwear, so it was relatively tasteful, haha. 

I didn't respond because there were two people sitting next to me that I didn't know too well, and I think pulling up a picture of another guy's bulge thirty minutes after you've been introduced to someone is a bit of a faux pas. Also, it was a little aggressive and I wanted more time to respond. Later that night he texted me ""No?"" and I explained the situation, but thanked him for the pic. 

The next morning he started sending me some innocent selfies, and then things escalated from there. He sent another underwear pic, and I kind of laughed it out. Then he sent a picture of him naked in the mirror, but with a lot of steam. I told him to hold his horses because we still hadn't been on a first date, but I tried to do it in a flirtatious way. So granted, I was sending mixed signals, but I explained that I preferred to not rush things. 

Later that day he sent me a picture of his ass. I said, ""So, now I've seen your ass and ballsack before we've even met. Calm down Speedy Gonzales, let's take it slow. As much as I'm enjoying these let's not put the horse before the cart."" He seemed apologetic, but I think having to tell someone three times to pull it back is a little much. 

But, I don't have a lot of dating app experience. It's not like I haven't been sent dick pics before, but usually its either the first thing that gets sent, or you wait until things are a little more serious. He says he's not looking for a hookup either, but the flood of pics makes me apprehensive. 

Am I just out of touch? Am I being too prudish? Should this be a deal breaker if I'm looking for a relationship? I mean, it's obviously a bit soon to tell, but clearly we seem to have different priorities.
