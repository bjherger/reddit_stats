I'll try to be brief. 

About me: 19, Sophomore in college and pretty much gay

I had this friend from classes, let's call him Tony. Tony is a really crazy / chill guy that I just met this semester and we became the best of friends in no time. Since Day 1 (of like freshmen year when I saw him around) I've had a little crush on Tony and always thought he showed signs of reciprocation. It wasn't until like 4 months of being friends (we have like every class together this semester which is rare in college; so we became friends fast) that I got really drunk one night while going to a bar with some friends and I called Tony to come pick me up. We did our usual thing which is smoke some weed and drive around the city.

But Tony mentioned a mutual friend, let's call her Lucy, that he wanted to invite to our bro-nding. I don't really like it because I can already see that he's probably attracted to her but I invite her and we end up all in my room watching a movie in my bed. Tony then jokes about having a threesome. We're all really tired and giggly so we pretend to be having a threesome but really we just cuddled. 

Like a week later, Tony and I were in my room playing Mario Kart and Tony says he's sore (smooth Tony!) so I offer to give him a back massage. He lays in my bed and I climb on top of his butt and do the works. He does the same for me. I tell him to take his shirt off and I sprayed some lotion on and massaged him. He quickly did the same for me. I don't normally have these interactions with my straight friends so it's kind of dawning on me that he may like me. 

Like 2 or 3 days later, Tony and I come back from somewhere drunk and we end up in my room. We played some video games then eventually in the same position as last time. But as we're drunk we're less inhibited and we go straight for cuddling. It was different this time. I felt some passion. Some grinding in the hips from Tony. Oh and a niceee boner. I couldn't help but want to grab so I jokingly ""Honk Honk""ed him. He laughed. I laughed. It ended up with us mutually jerkin... so yeah. I'm definitely sure that he was into me. He asked me if I was bisexual, I told him yeah kinda. I asked him. He said he didn't know. Honestly I was scared to say 'gay' in fear of him reacting too strongly to just the word. 

Repeat that like 3 more times until Thanksgiving. Thanksgiving comes by and we keep up with each other as we're distances away. After some flirty but not so flattering snapchats, I'm starting to think ""Yeah maybe he'd be a good fit.""

Very close to exams, we repeat cycle. But this time it feels a little off. We're in bed cuddling but there's no passion this time. He got a phone call and answered it for like 10 minutes. No prob. But then he starts talking about this girl he had sex with early in the year (before we started doing anything) and it bothered me. So I pulled away and he tried to recover. I also noticed he didn't have a boner which is cool I didn't care for that but it just felt weird then. I'm not sure if he noticed I was bothered because he's kinda ditzy like that but I ended our cuddling session. 

Come to yesterday when exams were over I hear from mutual friend Lucy that she's going to Tony's house tonight and she is not shy from telling me that they're going bang. Like bang = sex. I'm not sure how I felt about it then; but I'm pretty sure I'm unsettled by it. I didn't let her know because I was pretty sure she didn't know about me and Tony and I didn't want to disclose anything about Tony without his permission, and seeing how we weren't exclusive or even had sex I knew I wouldn't really win. 

Today, I bronded with Tony and asked about him and Lucy. He seemed to not want to tell me but I got it of him. They had sex of course, like he wouldn't spare a detail about all the goddam positions they had sex in. As a bro I was glad to listen but I felt a little heart broken at the same time. I asked him if they were going to date and he said he said yeah maybe.

My heart dropped. That's all I needed. 

It was really silent for what felt like a minute.

I told him we couldn't cuddle anymore.  

More silence.

I glanced up and saw his face was a little sad. 

He asked if we could still all three cuddle. I told him ""Nah it's just you and Lucy."" 

""Massages?"" 

""Nah, those either""

More silence. 

I could tell he was getting sadder so I changed the subject. That's the last we talked about that and moved on to getting food. Since this is our last day on campus we said our goodbyes until next semester.

I just feel confused mostly. I'm not sure if I should feel cheated on and be pissed or I should have known better to have someone that's confused about their own sexuality. I think the thing that actually pisses me off is that I didn't really have a chance just because I'm a guy and he's a guy. I'd go off on a rant about the pressures of society but it wouldn't change anything. He chose her. It pissed me off.

Where do I go from here... So lost. So confused. I just know my Ego's hurt.

**TLDR; Met a cool guy friend. We had a threesome-cuddle with a mutual friend who's a girl. Guy and I messed around on several different occasions. I find out yesterday that Guy and Girl had sex.

We have a very strong and passionate emotional connection and that feeds very strongly into our sex. In fact, genital stimulation probably makes up less than 20% of our sex time. There's a lot more cuddling and making out, which is great. 

Our sex has improved a lot. since we started with me not even being able to get off, to me being to get off if I did myself, to him being able to finish what I started. It seems like it'll improve over time. It doesn't help at all that my penis is extremely sensitive and even touching it sometimes hurts (I'm uncut). 

On his end though it seems he doesn't really have many complaints in that regard. It's really embarrassing but he like to brag to his friends about my supposed oral prowess (I swear, everything I do I learnt from porn). Good for him, because on our first sex bender (and first sexual encounter), he managed to get off 5 times to my 0. Of course, I didn't mind... I knew it was my own insecurity and mental blocks that held me back and I really appreciated that he tried so hard to help me come.

Anal sex has been a great challenge for us. In the past both of us generally bottomed, though mine doesn't really count (And he insists that since the one time I did it before him the guy must have missed since I didn't feel a thing). We've tried a few times, and been successful-ish. He has trouble getting in because, to put it bluntly, he is a little smaller than average (which actually makes it a lot easier to stimulate orally and is greatly appreciated by my jaw). I have trouble even trying to top because whenever we start trying, I immediately go soft, which sucks because I know he enjoys it and I would really like to help with that. When we do succeed, it's not exactly a pleasant experience for me anyway. He seems to enjoy it but I don't get much out of it.

It didn't help that I let him cum inside me (we got tested after 3 months of exclusivity) and all the wonderful fantasies about how it should have felt (hot loads bursting in my colon) came crashing down when all I got were cummy farts. Boo.

Would also be nice to find my prostate, but I think all 20 of our fingers are too short :(.

 I've probably made it sound like we have a horrible sex life, but that would be disingenuous. I really enjoy our sex together. it's fun, intimate, and we laugh and enjoy ourselves deeply. I just think there's room for it to be better. We got all the fun parts pat, we just haven't got all the sex parts.

TL;DNR: 2 Bottoms, 1 small cock, 1 over-sensitive cock, how can we make sex feel more like porn looks. Also where the fuck is my prostate?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;m way less experienced than my boyfriend in sex and I feel like that might be holding our sex back from its full potential and I was hoping for some tips or advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a very strong and passionate emotional connection and that feeds very strongly into our sex. In fact, genital stimulation probably makes up less than 20% of our sex time. There&amp;#39;s a lot more cuddling and making out, which is great. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our sex has improved a lot. since we started with me not even being able to get off, to me being to get off if I did myself, to him being able to finish what I started. It seems like it&amp;#39;ll improve over time. It doesn&amp;#39;t help at all that my penis is extremely sensitive and even touching it sometimes hurts (I&amp;#39;m uncut). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On his end though it seems he doesn&amp;#39;t really have many complaints in that regard. It&amp;#39;s really embarrassing but he like to brag to his friends about my supposed oral prowess (I swear, everything I do I learnt from porn). Good for him, because on our first sex bender (and first sexual encounter), he managed to get off 5 times to my 0. Of course, I didn&amp;#39;t mind... I knew it was my own insecurity and mental blocks that held me back and I really appreciated that he tried so hard to help me come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anal sex has been a great challenge for us. In the past both of us generally bottomed, though mine doesn&amp;#39;t really count (And he insists that since the one time I did it before him the guy must have missed since I didn&amp;#39;t feel a thing). We&amp;#39;ve tried a few times, and been successful-ish. He has trouble getting in because, to put it bluntly, he is a little smaller than average (which actually makes it a lot easier to stimulate orally and is greatly appreciated by my jaw). I have trouble even trying to top because whenever we start trying, I immediately go soft, which sucks because I know he enjoys it and I would really like to help with that. When we do succeed, it&amp;#39;s not exactly a pleasant experience for me anyway. He seems to enjoy it but I don&amp;#39;t get much out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It didn&amp;#39;t help that I let him cum inside me (we got tested after 3 months of exclusivity) and all the wonderful fantasies about how it should have felt (hot loads bursting in my colon) came crashing down when all I got were cummy farts. Boo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would also be nice to find my prostate, but I think all 20 of our fingers are too short :(.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve probably made it sound like we have a horrible sex life, but that would be disingenuous. I really enjoy our sex together. it&amp;#39;s fun, intimate, and we laugh and enjoy ourselves deeply. I just think there&amp;#39;s room for it to be better. We got all the fun parts pat, we just haven&amp;#39;t got all the sex parts.&lt;/p&gt;

You'd think I'd have little to no problem with it, right? Of course not, that'd be too easy!

I'll be honest, most of it has been on my end so far. There's not a lot of available guys to begin with, but if I really tried, there are guys out there. Here's the issue though, I'm too sketched out by most guys around here to even ask.

My town has a few issues. Meth is a big problem around here. I recently learned that even my high-functioning, articulate friend of a few years has been battling a meth addiction recently (so, it's not like it's just the homeless guys doing it). STDs like syphilis and herpes and even HIV are on the rise because of drug use, misinformation/lack of information, and because people have this false idea of ""oh, that doesn't happen to people around here"", because for years and years, it didn't. 

So, naturally, I'm scared as fuck to even think about getting anywhere near most guys around here. What with so many people doing drugs and behaving irresponsibly, and promiscuity kind of ""the norm"" around here, in my mind, anyone could have anything. 

But at the same time, it's been so goddamn long, and I'm so horny. There's no chance of me dating anyone anytime soon, because this is such a shitty place, so that's off the table too, I just need to ""get some"" to hold me over.

So, I've been lurking around this sub for about a year and then eventually fell in love with naughty subreddits and created this account a while back so I could participate... So, this is a semi-throwaway. Anyways, on to the point. Over the past two years I've really come to understand my sexuality in a whole new way. I'm 20 now, and my understanding of being different or not-straight probably came to be around the age of 12. I became very flamboyant then and got made fun of a lot for it, so from there, I quickly came to my senses and reverted to a manly, masculine persona. That was around middle school, then going into high school I just kept to myself acted straight, was fairly involved but never really clicked with a whole lot of guys. The main reason I never clicked with a bunch of guys in school was partially because I wanted to only hang out with 'cool' people and I am now aware that, these 'cool' people are often cocks. So, I built up an anxiety toward getting to know/interacting with guys. That was throughout grades 9 and 10. Then I got to know people who were more on my wavelength. The guys who weren't dicks grew up in ways that I had already, and were more open to doing things that I found fun (drinking, smoking going out). They were just nice social dudes, so this group of guys and a group of girls I was always semi friends with joined forces. Throughout this time and during high school I only ever liked/crushed on girls. It was even very sexual, but I got to know girls and just liked them in obsessive sort of ways, had a few make-out sessions, fingered a girl. Nothing big. However, in grade eleven on went on a school trip and got really close with this guy who was a year younger than me. We can call this guy 'Sean'. Long story short we became very close friends and after five months of hanging out we got drunk and sucked each others dicks, that happened two or three times. Nobody knew, but, I had my first experience with a dude and it was awesome. I enjoyed it more than the girl I fingered and made-out with, but just in general he was a better looking (and better trimmed, if ya catch my drift) person overall. After that we drifted apart in my last year of High school. Grade 12 was ridiculously fun and I never really worried about the blowjobs, i told one friend who was a girl I actually liked off and on quite often. Anyways, we graduate, then we all head off in our separate ways to go to university. During my first year at uni I was still living at home but ended up having some alcohol/drug issues and became heavily depressed. During this year I got to know somebody who we will call 'Derek'. Derek and I got very close and we still are (sort of, we've just started to drift apart). Long story short, Derek was the first guy I ever developed 'feelings' for. After a year of knowing each other we both took a year off from school and hung out constantly. Nothing sexual ever happened between us and we often talked about girls, but I got some gay vibes from him. He would say things like 'how would you react to a friend coming out to you' he said that a few times, or one time we were on shrooms and he said 'imagine if two guys who were friends just hooked up and nobody knew about it? Like I'm just saying.' When he brought things like this up, I never responded in a way that hinted my sexuality, in fact I sometimes responded awkwardly. I felt like he knew, but there weren't really any reasons for him to suspect that I was into dudes. Anyways, during our year off I developed horrible anxiety and we did a lot of drugs which resulted in me becoming a tad clingy and I think resulted in us drifting apart now. I did not realize that I was really just kind of 'in love' with him. He was also just a negative, kind of mean person some times so I'm coming to terms with not having him in my life, its been hard. Anyways, this past summer our year off ended and we just didn't hang out ever, and I started to realize who I was, in terms of my bisexuality. I told a close female friend of mine from my high school group as she had made out with a girl before, and watches lesbian porn. I love her a lot, we are each other's longest friend. I told her about my experimentation in high school with Sean, and she thanked me for being open with her and has offered my lots of support since. Lately I've wanted to come out, and this is where my thoughts really start going bat-shit crazy. 

1. I don't know how to tell my guy friends, and also don't know how they will react. 

2. I don't want this to change anything in my life, and struggle with how love interests and crushes will view me. 

3. Should I come out to my family, or keep it in my personal life?

These numbers aren't working for me, basically, I just don't know if it's worth coming out or not. At this point I'm interested in guys although in the long run, I've always wanted to be with a girl. However, perhaps my longing for a girl is socially engrained, and a sort of denial/rejection of my homosexual feelings. I often question, 'what if I'm actually just gay? What is this is all just a huge shit-storm of denial?' However, I have sex dreams with girls, and have liked and had sex with girls and enjoyed them. I don't know how i feel about anal with dudes. Also, everyone in my life perceives me as very masculine and straight. So they wouldn't see it coming, really. Should I only come out once I meet a guy and our sexuality and desire to be together is established? Would not coming out really just be easier because people won't question and feel uneasy about my bisexuality?
Sorry for the horrible organization of this whole thing,lots of rambling, just looking for advice or any thoughts really.

TL;DR: Everyone in my life thinks I'm straight and I'm masculine. Within the past two years I've come to terms with liking dudes, pretty sure I'm bi.

Could being gay could be an option for someone who is lonely and frustrated especially when it comes to women? Whenever a girl gives you her #, finds you attractive on Tinder, or worse friendly to you in person and never agrees to get together with you, if you ask, it is extremely FRUSTRATING. I'm quite awkward when it comes to talking to girls, especially when texting/chatting. Why do girls often turn away from guys who are awkward talkers? Many guys are like that too. It understand that talking about anything violent, political, religious, or racial, turning people down. Which I don't talk about.  Just sounding clumsy when you talk turns too many people down. 

I'm introverted, physically attractive, never got in serious trouble (never suspended from school, had to visit principles office, or got a ticket from a Police Officer), and get good grades. Being on break right now (go to a local community college), I'll be very bored as I don't have anyone to get together with. Sitting at home and playing World of Tanks, browsing the web aimlessly, and looking at pictures on Instagram,etc makes both my dad and me frustrated at times.

I have never been in a relationship and am possibly considering going to a gay bar to hopefully find some good friends. I don't think I'm gay but for the purpose of finding good friends and possibly a future relationship; I might try being gay. Is there a big difference between to talking with gays vs. women and non gays? Anyone else here become gay  as a result of failure and rejection from women and non gays?

I had a long distance relationship with my ex boyfriend for two years and we saw each other several times a month. He was 24 and I was 19.
This March I broke up with him. My cousin commited suicide that month and I was depressed and felt empty inside. I told my ex all about it, but he did not really care or try to help me. He was not there for me and so I eventually decided to break up.

We had a set of problems throughout the relationship. He was not outed, so I never got to meet his friends and he denied me in public. Only his parents knew about me and I became the target of their frustration and hate, which my boyfriend accepted and did not try to stop. When he met my friends, he acted exceptionally rude, that is why I cannot talk with them about this stuff, they just hate him.

What followed after the break up was me and him addressing reproaches to each other and hurting and insulting. I blocked him some times on my phone, but every two or three months, we try to contact the other one again, because we just can't find peace with it and we want to resolve things :/
This all sounds very negative, but he also had his positive sides and that was why I loved him and stayed with him. 
Now I just cannot bring this part of my life to a close. There are so many things I want to talk out with him, just to find my peace with it, but every now and then he says something really mean, for example about my cousin's suicide, and he tries to hurt me. And then I fire back and the circle goes on and on.
He recently told me that, because of a row of incidents, he totally accepts to be gay now and he outed himself. I should be happy for him, but I just feel hurt, because I tried everything to help him and nothing did, and now because of some stupid events he came out of the closet...

I wish I could just cut him out of my life and block him on my phone, but that is something we both don't really want to happen. We want to stay in touch, but it always just ends up with us hurting each other...
So, any advice? :/","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys, I don&amp;#39;t really have people to talk about this, so I hope some of you can help :/&lt;/p&gt;
