Sadly I've been cursed with an attraction to average guys.. the type you'd never know was gay unless implicitly stated. These guys seem to be the hardest to find..for obvious reasons ha

Grindr and Scruff are usually just for hook-ups and will likely not be looking for anything beyond the random hookup..

The bars/gay bars are likely for hookups as well..

Don't get me wrong, I love sex and would be happy to indulge in it frequently. But the no strings attached thing is offputting at times. Would like a boyfriend to hang out with, watch movies, cuddle, whatever..

Maybe the gym? But then again..how do you know who is gay and who isn't? But now that I think about it..I assume people don't like to be pursued while they are trying to get through their workouts..

I'm an extremely shy and quiet guy. I have loads of affection and loyalty when I'm around people I know.. the problem is people can't tell I'm that way right off the bat. I think they find my shy and quiet demeanor as cold and stuckup which is the exact opposite..

I've never been in a relationship. I'm so curious how people manage to do it..with such ease at that.

So about 2 months ago I went over to my best friends house. They are 2 amazing gay boys who have been in a relationship for almost a whole year if not more than a year. Let's call them Seth and James.

We were all laying on a futon cuddled up watching a movie. Next thing I know there are hands all over. Before anything really happened James asked if I was OK with it. I took a second to respond then agreed. We continue and have an amazing time

This happens a few more times. Eventually we get to a point where it becomes an unspoken thing that we can fool around on an individual level. I was giving Seth head and James walked in and started to join. That happening told me that James wouldn't care if 1-on-1 took place

Fast forward to Saturday. I go over to their house and Seth was sleeping. James tells me and a friend that they have been fighting so much that it's starting to become toxic and he is wanting out. He tells us that every time they argue they just go in circles and no one concedes. 

They were sleeping in separate rooms so when I wanted to go to bed James told me to take his. I wake up the next morning with him next to me. He started feeling on me then it escalated to me giving him head.

Later that night Seth and I went out drinking. We go over to a friend's house and end up having sex.

That was 2 days ago and tonight I got a call from Seth asking if I had checked any messages. I told him I hadn't. Apparently James sent me a message that said ""You should be ashamed of yourself."" When I read this I was pretty upset.

 First off we had just gotten together a few days before. Second, James hadn't told Seth that we were together.

I just got a call from Seth and he informed me that James is being extremely forgiving. He says he forgives me and Seth. 

Seth knows that James and I got together but only because I said something.

Basically here is my question; What should I say, or is there anything to say, to James about this situation? 

My opinion on it is this, 
No rules or boundaries were ever set

He still hasn't told Seth that him and I are equally guilty

And Seth was going to break up with him regardless of if I was in the picture or not. (So he says)

Any help from my Bros would be greatly appreciated. I'll be up all night at work to respond to any questions. Thanks Bros!

&lt;p&gt;My opinion on it is this, 
No rules or boundaries were ever set&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He still hasn&amp;#39;t told Seth that him and I are equally guilty&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Seth was going to break up with him regardless of if I was in the picture or not. (So he says)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any help from my Bros would be greatly appreciated. I&amp;#39;ll be up all night at work to respond to any questions. Thanks Bros!&lt;/p&gt;

My boyfriend of three years and I broke up and he moved out of state for a new job. I miss him terribly and feel sick to my stomach at the thought of him being with other people. I've been asked on dates and I've gone but my mind isn't there. I know I need time before I date or whatever but all I feel is crappy. 


The Whole Thing:

My boyfriend and I started dating, but I knew that he'd eventually move away since he's a pilot. When you're young (19) and you're in love, time isn't really time - you think there's plenty - until we grow up. 

We had a shit load of problems through our relationship and stuck by each other even though it became toxic. He lived with me. We had dogs. Our life was utterly imperfect but also perfect at the same time. I was his third sexual experience; he wanted to explore. I wasn't okay with it. 

He got his dream job and I wasn't happy with my career so I'm back in school pursuing what I've always wanted to be...a surgeon. It's been a few weeks since he's been gone but he texted me for my birthday. I have the urge to text him all of the time to tell him that I miss him but I stop myself; I didn't on New Year's eve though - I drunk texted/word vomited. I unfriended him off Facebook in anger long before this and he blocked me on Instagram, so now we have literally no contact. 

I'm trying here. I've gone on dates. I'm hanging with friends. I'm focusing on school. I'm volunteering at a hospital. I'm filling my time and head with anything and everything that isn't him but it creeps on me and smacks me in the chest. And I know he's off sleeping with other boys, maybe thinking about me here and there, but I can't help feeling sad.

I don't see myself marrying or having kids but I did with him; even though we were toxic in some ways, we were great in others. There's a part of me that wonders if we'll ever get back together but I'm not sure. I miss him. There are no words to describe how I feel. 

I was cleaning the other day and found a large printed photograph of us that I meant to get framed a long time ago and started sobbing. This was before the night of my birthday party.

My best friend flew all the way from Chicago to see me because he knew I was depressed but that didn't even put a smile on my face. I'm in these premed classes and I feel empty. The hospital makes me a feel a bit better. I get to help patients and know that someday I'll improve the quality of their lives. 

My family keeps saying ""In ten years from now, you'll be a surgeon and you can have any boy you want,"" but that doesn't make me feel any better. I lost my best friend. I lost the person I love and someone who I thought I'd spend most if not the rest of my life with; I really thought we'd at least be together for the next fifteen years at the minimum. 

I can't even compose this because the thought of him sleeping with other people pisses me off. I've had so many opportunities to sleep with other guys in the last two weeks alone and I haven't. A guy kissed me after a date and I got mad. 

I went to a counselor today and she told me that I may need some anti-depressants but I've weaned myself off those for a while now and I'm pretty sure I can get through this without them.

Do you guys have any advice? I know part of this is just venting but what do I do?

Meet  a guy on OKCUPID, Jackd, Scruff, Tinder... talk on phone a bit, Skype. Things seem to match up and be cool. You visit them for a weekend but get a hotel just in case.

When visiting a few surrounding areas (Middle of CA, Oregon, Washington, Texas, Arizona, Idaho, Utah, Alaska, etc.). I see to meet guys who want to settle down and are looking to date and seem like they really want to meet me. All my friends complain about dating but never do anything about it. I get messages all the time why do the good ones seem so far away or wish you where here but want to get your experience / advice. 

My experience dating here (too many choices, no one wants to settle, flakey, lots of visitors, prices are too high so the area is transient, age divide because of economics and ease of settling down, alternative interests or scenarios, dating fetishes of unusual interest, divergent political views with suburbs / other areas, huge gay bar and drug culture or down low and bisexual in the burbs, those in Grad School tend to move away, people get burnt out by the ""gay culture,"" etc...). I didn't experience this mentality when traveling the world in many places.

We have a great life, lots of mutual interests, and I genuinely love this man. However, he never wants to have sex. He never initiates it. If he does it's just blowjobs. We've probably had anal sex 10 or so times the entire time we have been together. It has always been an issue for me. I have brought it up in every way I can think of. It has gotten to the point that I just don't believe he wants to have sex with me.

What can I do to increase his sex drive? He says he loves me, says he enjoys having sex with me, and he swears he's attracted to me. I just don't think his actions reflect that. If someone truly enjoys something they would want to do it often or they would bring up doing it. Like if you really love water parks you're going to try and go as often as you can. It has led to me feeling pretty shitty about myself. I have never had an issue with sex in past relationships.

He blames his disinterest in sex on all sorts of things. Either he's tired, or he doesn't feel sexy, or ""we had sex yesterday"". Keep in mind sex to him is a blowjob so if I got my weekly blowjob he feels like he has done his part.

Meanwhile, I just look at the man and get aroused. This seems normal to me. Like when he's naked, which is most of the time, and he bends over or really anything I get aroused. He thinks it's funny and brushes off my advances but to me it just shows that I love him. Him not having the same reaction makes me feel like he doesn't love me.

I feel like maybe I am being crazy. But part of me thinks we will never be compatible about these things. I don't want him to feel like he has to have sex with me. I don't want to pressure him into sex. I just don't know what else to do and I feel like it is breaking us apart.

His reactions are always the same when I get upset. He always turns it on me. Why do I want to have sex so much? Why do I have to be such a fanatic about it? Ideally I would love to have sex with him every day. But that is not what I am asking him for. I ask for a two a week  minimum. And I settle for the blowjobs. But I am just tired of always initiating and most of the time being rejected.

Sorry for rambling. It's nearly 1AM and I have to be up at 5 but we got in an argument about it again tonight. He was able to sleep no problem which always pisses me off because while he's catching z's I am up asking the internet for help.

Quick background/context: I'm a 25 year old guy with a good job, work out 4x a week, sane, etc. I've fooled around with a few guys and would say that I'm pretty sexually experienced, even good, with most things - except bottoming. 

I've bottomed twice in my life, both in the past six months, and both with quite large guys (9 inches plus). Both times it was physically possible - we took it slow, used lots of lube, etc. but neither time did I get any pleasure whatsoever. 

After a while, it got less uncomfortable, but I wasn't even close to being hard, my dick was the softest/smallest its ever been, and it was certainly nowhere near the levels of pleasure I've been told one can expect. I've just never experienced or associated any pleasure with bottoming. 

I prefer bigger guys, I *want* to be a good bottom, and I have no issues with the shame/cleanliness factor some guys struggle with. I also have zero desire to top.

So, being the logical person I am, I have a few questions:

* Is this something I can practice and work on to eventually enjoy bottoming one day? If so, how?
* Is it possible I will never enjoy bottoming? What are my alternatives? How common is this, and will I be looked on like a freak?
* How long did it take you to enjoy bottoming when you first started?

Thanks for your help. Currently going through a bit of a sexual existential crisis with all this and it's leading me through a bit of depression - I don't want to meet the man I want to spend the rest of my life with only to tell him that I don't enjoy bottoming..

I have never done anything like this before and I wasn't physically harassing him or anything. I just had a crush on him and it's stupid because I never even met him. It basically started like this:

Saw a post on a subreddit, like gaymersgonemild I think? &gt; Thought ""this guy is really fucking cute"" &gt; Went to comments &gt; Saw him promoting his Tumblr &gt; Went on his blog and saw he lived in my city. It pretty much went downhill from there.

I went through his blog and saw we had so many shared interests. I read some text posts that I felt empathy towards. I tried reaching out and probably came across as a complete creep. I can't even remember what I said on my first message but I'm sure it was fucking weird. After that I used Tumblr's ""Ask me anything"" to talk to him basically. Eventually I told myself I had to stop.. and I did. Until I came back from out of the country and saw his profile on a Grindr. I couldn't help myself I just had to try and reach out to him. So I used what I saw on his blog to try and talk to him. Eventually he caught on. Afterwards I stopped again, even deleted my profile and just moved on. Until I downloaded the app a few months later and tried to reach out one last time.

I asked him to please give me some kind of response this time. I don't know what I was expecting from reaching out one last time. I guess in my not-so-smart moment I just wanted a response, any response. And he gave me one. He wasn't even mean about it. It was actually a really nice response compared to what I was expecting. He simply stated my actions were stalker-ish (they definitely were) and made him uncomfortable and asked me to please leave him alone. In hindsight what more could he have said? What the hell was I thinking? I guess I wasn't thinking at all actually.  

But deep down I didn't really want a response from him, I wanted to apologize. I wanted him to forgive me for what I had done and that is complete bullshit on my part. Why the hell would he forgive me? He has 0 reason to. I'm a fucking creep in his mind and I dont blame him. I acted like a crazy fucking ex before I ever even met the poor dude. 

And THAT'S why I'm hating myself. I feel like shit about everything I did, I want to move on but I can't stop beating myself up for cyber stalking him. I feel dirty. Him ""forgiving"" me probably wouldn't have done much, but I think it would have helped me forgive myself. 

Anybody have any advice for me to help me move on and forgive myself? I realize there's not much anybody can say other than I just need to stop being a little bitch but I'm hoping someone can relate. I'm not trying to be the victim here, he's the victim and I feel like I'm just a creep now.

My ex had started to appear on Grindr which I found unusual seen as the distance between us, he would come and go a few days apart for about two weeks and I'll be honest and say I didn't really think much of it - we both have our own lives now and what he's doing in my city, or in one instance a couple hundred feet from where I work was nothing to do with me.

I was surprised when one night he sent me a message on Grindr, wishing me all the best for the new year. Initially I didn't see his message and came off Grindr - when I went back on there was another message from him saying there is no need to ignore him as he was sure we'd both grown up since breaking up.

My reply was simple, just saying thanks and wishing him all the best too - he then explained what he was doing in my city in case I was wondering to which I replied I hadn't been wondering as it was his life, he's free to do as he wishes just am I (in a non horrible way!). He then asked if it would be okay for him to see me quickly, for 10 minutes or so to which I declined in a civil and polite manner.

So, a few days later we spoke again - at some length - mainly about what we have both been up to in general and work etc, but then his questions started to become more private, ""have you had many dates"" etc, he said he had been on one and sent me a picture of the dude (which I didn't ask for). I told him I've been on a number of dates and I had been dating a dude for a short while but it never went anywhere - then he started asking for pictures?!

Don't get me wrong, I still love him and miss him, however I don't miss what we had nor do I wish it to return. I Guess I just wanted to get this off my chest also!

So anyway, I guess my question is how do you respond to exes? Do you ignore them, answer their questions honestly or lie to soften the blow in case you cause upset, or even big yourself up?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll start with a bit of background: I&amp;#39;m 21 and my ex is 22, we live 30 miles apart in different cities - we were together for 3 years and it&amp;#39;s been just over a year since we broke up.

(someone ive known for a few months, kind of friends but not close) We began talking more, making fun of each other, ""hitting"" each other etc. He touches my face sometimes, poking my nose, etc...
Anyway he's been on my mind for the past 2 weeks, I think I can't get him out of my mind for some reason. I messaged him on facebook once and it seemed pretty normal and platonic, but at the card shop we were playing super smash bros and when sitting on the couch his legs were literally pressed up next to mine and we were sitting shoulder to shoulder, the third guy next to him was i guess slightly smellier than me so I guess he did it to not have to press up against him. The week after that incident he began talking to me slightly less but when he played smash bros again he briefly tilted his head towards me as if he was going to put his head on my shoulder (after he was out of the game) and I kind of just ignored it. I asked for his number and he gave it to me and we haven't talked since (we will again i assume this friday). He's just been on my mind for about the past month or so and I am wondering if I was giving off negative signals (receding slightly if he touched me, etc), or is he just a straight boy like I assume? I don't know too much about him and I am wondering why I can't just forget about him romantically? I hate getting burned and I don't really need a relationship (it would be nice but not necessary)...So what do you bros do when finding out if someone has the hots for you?

I was thinking today about me, before I met my partner. I drank heavily daily, often had anonymous hookups, and basically was your run of the mill asshole. I am not quite sure how it happened - out of high school I was a nice guy -  wouldn't hurt a fly, I wore my heart on my sleeve. Somewhere along the line I turned in to an alcohol guzzling sex crazed lunatic. I did a lot of stuff I regret. Why did I do this? It is not me, it really isn't. I even have sought people out just to apologize.

The first few times I hooked up with someone - I distinctly remember thinking we were dating. I probably seemed a little crazy. But I was 22! No one had ever touched my penis before! When everyone else was figuring out how to date, I was busy being stuck in the closet... finding excuses NOT to have sex with girls. For about a year... I saw hookups as dates. After that, I just started kind of using people for sex. Was this some sort of self defense mechanism? Push them away before they push me away? I was not a nice person. I HATE myself when I think or remember just about anything I did from the ages of 23 to 27.

Fast forward a few years. I met my partner, Jeremy. Things were, and are great. Been inseparable since we first started dating 5 years ago. I would never ever cheat on him, ever. The idea of doing anything with anyone else sexually speaking kind of turns me off. I am all about Jeremy. 

But when we first started dating I came to the strangest realization. I had no hobbies. NONE. My hobbies for most of my twenties were getting drunk,Going to the gym, and getting guys to take off their pants. I found myself with no websites to frequent. Adam4Adam, gay.com, Out In America, Grinder - all were my previous daily visits. Then... none interested me all of a sudden when I met Jeremy - which is awesome. I found an entirely new me. I've taken up hobbies. I've learned things. I've rekindled friendships I let stale out in the name of getting off. I barely ever drink now. It just inst as fun as it used to be. Alcohol is a funny drug. It enables you to forget some of your darkest hours. 

My discussion topic:

What is that? Why did I do all of this? Has anyone had similar experiences? Is apologizing to the people I can remember hurting good enough penance? 

lets be clear, I never actually physically hurt anyone. I just was kind of a jerk at times, which is totally out of character, when I am sober. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello all. &lt;/p&gt;

Is it okay/not okay/questionable/completely and totally wrong, when looking at your sexual history? I think that if you know that you've got something, or if you haven't been tested- don't donate. On the other hand, if you have been tested recently and/or if you're in a committed relationship, you're fine to donate, but ONLY if you're sure that you're clean. Am I right or wrong on this?

So, if any of you have donated blood before, you know they ask you a lot of questions about your sexual history and, more specifically, any gay sexual history. I completely support them asking, because they need to screen for possible diseases, and it isn't worth the time to take your blood if you're full of every STD.

That being said, I'm not. I've been in a committed, monogamous relationship for the past 2.5 years. We both got tested before we even got together, so we know we're both clean. I used to be REALLY into donating blood. I figure it's a simple thing that I can do to help someone, and it's crazy easy. However, once I became sexually active in the gay scene, I stopped donating, because I knew that even if they told me they were clean, and even if I got tested immediately after, I might still have gotten something. But now that I'm in a committed relationship, and we haven't had any problems with STDs in the entire time we've been together, AND we've been tested, I figure that it's okay to go and donate. I know that I'm clean. 

But the Red Cross, or whoever is doing the donation, doesn't care if you know that. They don't trust you and they won't let you donate, just because you admit to having sex with other guys. So, is it okay to lie and say that I'm not gay/I haven't had sex with other men? I went to Brazil a few years ago, where I theoretically could have been exposed to malaria. However, I lived in a region far enough South that you can't get malaria there. It doesn't exist. But they didn't care that I physically couldn't have gotten it. By the sheer virtue of having been in Brazil for more than a month, they wouldn't let me donate for something like 2-3 years, until it was overly clear that I didn't have malaria. The first couple of times I jumped through their hoops (which took several hours) every time I wanted to donate. But after a while, I said, ""screw this, I'm lying."" and I just told them I'd never been out of the country. 

So what do you think? Is my Brazil analogy the same, or different? Is lying to donate blood, even when you know there's nothing wrong with your blood, wrong?

I have always been in a relationships with girls, well, thus far, and since I always had my doubts about being attracted to guys as well, and adding the fact that something happened in my life that maybe triggered all this, I decided to go for it and find some guys online. I spent a week or so on same dating site and I met this quite decent fella, good looking smart and we decided to meet up. He is younger than me, and does have quite decent experience with guys.

We had really fine date, we drank some and I ended up inviting him to my place for a drink but we established nothing sexually will happen, because I am not quite comfortable yet. We talked alot and he was surprised that I had no experience whatsoever, because I was quite relaxed and easy going. After that we kissed and he was surprised once again by the fact that that was my first kiss with a guy. He was flattered. We said our goodbyes and then he left.

We met once again today, he visited me and he ended up staying for six or so hours. We did made out and that was it. He told me whenever I feel comfortable going further, I should just let him know, no pressure. We spent the rest of the day cuddling and he admitted he really likes me.

So, the guy is great and really cute, and I really enjoy spending time with him. I must say my first gay kiss and making out wasn't anything groundbreaking nor disgusting, it was really normal, enjoyable I would say to some extent, and I really loved the cuddling part. Problem is that he got really into me, and I am afraid not to hurt him if I ever decide I'm not up to it. Point is that I am attracted to guys, that is a fact, but I'm afraid it was maybe blown out of proportions a bit in my head when it was strange and new to me, but now when it's real, I kinda lost my initial interest.

Question for you guys is, do you think I will get more comfortable and eventually would wish to have sex and pursue this relationship further, because right now, I'm really not so sure. Everything else is going smooth between us, well until now that is.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Question is at the end, and the story goes.. I have always been in a relationships with girls, well, thus far, and since I always had my doubts about being attracted to guys as well, and adding the fact that something happened in my life that maybe triggered all this, I decided to go for it and find some guys online. I spent a week or so on same dating site and I met this quite decent fella, good looking smart and we decided to meet up. He is younger than me, and does have quite decent experience with guys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had really fine date, we drank some and I ended up inviting him to my place for a drink but we established nothing sexually will happen, because I am not quite comfortable yet. We talked alot and he was surprised that I had no experience whatsoever, because I was quite relaxed and easy going. After that we kissed and he was surprised once again by the fact that that was my first kiss with a guy. He was flattered. We said our goodbyes and then he left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We met once again today, he visited me and he ended up staying for six or so hours. We did made out and that was it. He told me whenever I feel comfortable going further, I should just let him know, no pressure. We spent the rest of the day cuddling and he admitted he really likes me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the guy is great and really cute, and I really enjoy spending time with him. I must say my first gay kiss and making out wasn&amp;#39;t anything groundbreaking nor disgusting, it was really normal, enjoyable I would say to some extent, and I really loved the cuddling part.

A couple of weeks ago I met this amazing guy on grindr, he's the same age as me we're both 18. I know a lot of people will probably say its not the best place to meet guys when you're looking at getting into a relationship but anyway thats how we met. He messaged me first and we hit it off immediately and after about a day of messaging he asked me for my number.

Once we exchanged numbers we began texting daily and occasionally face timing. The texting started to become flirty and we both decided that we wanted to see each other so we decided to go on a date. A few days before our date he messaged me saying that he wasn't sure if he was ready for anything relationship wise but that he still wanted to see me. However he still remained flirtatious in his messaged on witch I called him out on and explained that he was making me feel confused. He apologised and and agreed that he was still be flirtatious but that he couldn't help it because he said that he still liked me.

Fast forward to our date where we went out for a meal and walked around the town chatting and getting to know each other better. We then ended up going back to my car where we talked and he explained that he was only out to a few friends (while I'm pretty much  out to everyone friends, family, work colleges) and that he's never been with a guy. One thing led to another and we ended up making out and cuddling for the rest of the evening in my car. I then walked him back to the train station but he said he was too scared to hold hands even though he wanted to. We agreed to see each other again although due to work and school we wont be able to see each other for a couple of weeks. 

I really like this guy but I feel like if things start to get serious and progress, him not being out will cause problems. Especially since I've came out to a lot of people in the past year and I no longer want to hide things for friends and family.

So, I met this guy on Grindr around a month ago, we started talking and switched to facebook that same day and we've been talking ever since.
Yesterday, I proposed that we should get lunch together after he finished working and he agreed, so I had this date set up with him.  
  
I was nervous but I figured it'd be fine since we've been talking for a while however, now that I'm back I felt that we didn't click as much as I hoped we did.  
  
He arrived and we talked a bit about our day and he kept saying he had a huge headache and wasn't feeling so good and honestly he seemed pretty distant from his usual online self, he often gave short answers and every time I tried to make a joke or say something silly (he'd often follow up on my jokes online and that's one of the things I liked about him) he'd stay shut and that made me feel a little sad and not talk as much for the rest of the date.  
  
It's true we don't exactly have a lot in common, I like games, anime and a bit of other nerdy stuff however I'm decently knowledgeable on other subjects (including the stuff he likes, movies, sports, tv shows) so I don't feel like we're totally disconnected.  
  
So reddit, what should I do? A couple hours have passed and we still haven't talked since the date.  
Do you think it could've been him not feeling so well that made the date a bit awkward? He really did seem out of place for me or do you think we just don't have that spark? Should I contact him after a bit or wait to be contacted? Should I try to set up another date and see if we connect better?

I [reluctantly] live in a small town and have been here for a few years now. As with a lot of small towns, people are very narrow minded when it comes to homosexuality, so for the most part I keep to myself. I will say that I've put myself out there to meet new people, if not to find a mate, then for the sole purpose of making friends. My efforts have proven futile as I really have no one to hang out with after work or on weekends, unless I make an effort to go back home for the weekend to see my friends, about 250+ miles away.  The closest thing I have are acquaintances...co-workers, and the majority of them, if not all are a lot older than me.  

I don't go out of my way to tell people I'm gay, but people know. We just don't openly discuss it.  In one of the other departments a guy was hired on, and at first glance, sure I thought he was cute, and after a while I made up some excuse to talk to him. He turned out to be straight, but I didn't care, we can still be friends.  We got to know one another and we seemed to have a lot on common. I gave him my number and told him we should hang out. From there, I started hanging out with him and another of his friends.  We had fun a handful of times, and he would always make a conscious effort to include me, and make me feel like he really wanted to be my friend. I was happy. I finally had someone I can have fun with.

We eventually started taking breaks at work together and just chat. Most of the time he would go on about some girl he met on Tinder, Facebook, or whatever.  Occasionally some of the guys he worked with would pass by us, laugh about something stupid before they left.  We always took our breaks in one particular area, and one day when I went there he was nowhere to be found.  I text him, but he didn't respond.  I figured maybe he went to take a break with his buddies, no biggie.  Later I went to take some paperwork to his department, and he seemed to make a conscious effort to avoid me. I figured maybe he wasn't in a good mood.  I text him to see what was up and got nothing in return. When I left for the day I saw him outside. I waved, but he just ignored me. I was starting to take it personal. 

Since then I haven't heard from him at all. It was all so sudden that he stop talking to me or texting me. Before he would always go out of his way to make a joke at me, or something, or he'd text me some stupid lyric to a song he was listening to, or complain about some girl. But now I get nothing. I can only assume that one, if not all, his co-workers are influencing his decisions since I know they're close minded. But he's always prided himself on not giving a shit what others think of him.

My friend back home says to write him off, but it's not so easy for me, since he's literally the only friend I've had since I moved here, and it's hard to move forward, especially since I have no idea why he would do so.

Any ideas on what I can do to get him to talk to me, or how should I proceed?  Any help would definitely be welcome.

EDIT: I'd like to clarify that aside from the initial attraction, I have no feelings for him whatsoever. I just wanted to be his friend, nothing more. So if he thought I had feelings for him in any way, it was not intentional.

Thank you to everyone for their responses. Unfortunately I haven't had any luck getting him to talk to me. I've tried going over to ask if everything was alright, and got the cold shoulder. My texts went unanswered as well, so I've decided to just let this go. I don't want to be the guy who continually bugs someone to be his friend. It really bums me out that this happened, and moreso because I don't know why it happened, but oh well. If there's any new developments I'll follow up.

Thanks again.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi bros, looking for some thoughts and/or maybe vent about this situation that I&amp;#39;m currently in.&lt;/p&gt;

We always took our breaks in one particular area, and one day when I went there he was nowhere to be found.  I text him, but he didn&amp;#39;t respond.  I figured maybe he went to take a break with his buddies, no biggie.  Later I went to take some paperwork to his department, and he seemed to make a conscious effort to avoid me. I figured maybe he wasn&amp;#39;t in a good mood.  I text him to see what was up and got nothing in return. When I left for the day I saw him outside. I waved, but he just ignored me. I was starting to take it personal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then I haven&amp;#39;t heard from him at all. It was all so sudden that he stop talking to me or texting me. Before he would always go out of his way to make a joke at me, or something, or he&amp;#39;d text me some stupid lyric to a song he was listening to, or complain about some girl. But now I get nothing. I can only assume that one, if not all, his co-workers are influencing his decisions since I know they&amp;#39;re close minded. But he&amp;#39;s always prided himself on not giving a shit what others think of him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friend back home says to write him off, but it&amp;#39;s not so easy for me, since he&amp;#39;s literally the only friend I&amp;#39;ve had since I moved here, and it&amp;#39;s hard to move forward, especially since I have no idea why he would do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any ideas on what I can do to get him to talk to me, or how should I proceed?  Any help would definitely be welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: I&amp;#39;d like to clarify that aside from the initial attraction, I have no feelings for him whatsoever. I just wanted to be his friend, nothing more. So if he thought I had feelings for him in any way, it was not intentional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you to everyone for their responses. Unfortunately I haven&amp;#39;t had any luck getting him to talk to me. I&amp;#39;ve tried going over to ask if everything was alright, and got the cold shoulder. My texts went unanswered as well, so I&amp;#39;ve decided to just let this go. I don&amp;#39;t want to be the guy who continually bugs someone to be his friend. It really bums me out that this happened, and moreso because I don&amp;#39;t know why it happened, but oh well. If there&amp;#39;s any new developments I&amp;#39;ll follow up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks again.&lt;/p&gt;

I chose not to continue hanging out with him. The PMs are personal attacks.

My reaction is deep pity for the guy. I imagine he's having a low in his love life at the moment and wants me to respond to his messages as a kind of warped validation.  

What would you do in this situation? I don't want to sign up to be the guy's counselor, but I see that I'm in a unique position to help him. I'd prefer not report him; that would just make him more unhappy.

I'm 24M; the provocateur is 21M.

I don't care how big mine is, yours is, his is, or hers is. Size does not matter to me. 

However I'm just curious, at what age did your penis stop growing? 

Im 17. I'd say I hit puberty rather early Id say. Around 11. I've been the same height/weight for about 2 years. I've wore the same shoe size for a number of years. I was almost certain Id stopped growing. With the last few months tho, my dick has been changing and growing a bit. I'm still on the smaller side. I just measured it fully erect and I was 5 1/2 inches long, and 5 1/2 inches around at the thickest portion. 

So anyhow, I was just curious as to what age yalls dicks finally stopped growing. Also, I feel like mine is really thick compared to its length.
