The thought of another guy taking control and putting his dick inside me for pleasure just drives me wild. However, when I first bottomed it wasn't the spectacular event I expected. It *hurt* -- granted, the guy was very large (8.5 or 9""); we had sex twice and, although I enjoyed it, I was worried about the pain. That was over a year ago, and I recently got out of a sex-filled relationship (different guy) in which I was the bottom. My ex was incredibly kind and attractive, so he always made sex great, but there has still been pain every time. 

I've always read those literotica stories where the guy takes the dick and feels a sharp pain -- but then it fades to ""incredible sensations of pleasure""... Well I'm still waiting on those. I've tried everything; I try relaxing and taking deep breaths, warming myself up beforehand, using buckets of lube, but every time it hurts throughout the whole process. The thing is, my prostate doesn't give me any feelings unless I'm jacking off while it's being stimulated, but the feelings push me to the edge of orgasm almost immediately. If I stop jerking to delay orgasm, then all the pain comes back and my dick deflates, but if I start jerking again then I'll instantly get to the point of orgasm. It's pretty frustrating. And regardless of the orgasm feelings, it always hurts when the dick is thrusting. Like, if the guy just sits still inside of me then I'm fine, but when he starts pumping back and forth it's pretty bad. It's especially bad if he pulls all the way out and then pushes back in-- like my hole is sensitive I guess?

I have a dildo I've been practicing with, and I've tried various lubes, but I never really get past the pain. What typically happened with my ex was that he'd go slow at first and let me adjust/jerk off a bit, then he'd do his thing and I'd let him finish, then he'd stay inside me while I jerked off. It worked, but it's certainly not the ideal sex that other people seem to be having.

In a nutshell, he kept coming out to my friends and I while drunk, but would slip right back into the closet the next day.  I just wanted advice on how to handle this, because I've had my own issues with low self-esteem and for some reason, watching him wrestle with his identity really upset me.

I'm going to keep details to the minimum out of respect for his and his family's privacy, but he attempted suicide yesterday.  His roommate found him in time (thank God) and he was able to be taken to the hospital.  He's expected to make a full recovery.

I (and our other friends) were *shocked*.  About a month after I last posted here, he came out ""for good"" and seemed to have started to accept himself, at least.  He came out to his parents and they were understanding and accepting, from what he told all of us.  He started talking to guys on apps and stuff, and I know he was hooking up with tons of guys, according to his roommate.  He didn't talk about his sexuality much, but he seemed to be on a good path.  I didn't think for one minute there was any risk at all he would attempt suicide.  

However, apparently all was not well.  Again, trying to keep details to a minimum, but his roommate found him.  There was a note saying he was doing this because felt ""like a mutant freak"" and hated being game.  There was also a lot about how he was supposed to be perfect and this huge flaw would forever make him a minority and a loser.  I was really, really shocked to hear all of this.  (Note: I haven't seen the note - his roommate read it and told me about it, and it's now in his parents' possession, I think.)

We're going to visit him tomorrow.  I'd love some advice on what I should say.  I was hoping maybe some people who went through similar bouts of depression could offer some advice on how they pulled through this.  We've been trying to encourage him and say we support him, but that hasn't been working, apparently.  I really want to call him a selfish jackass for pulling this shit, especially during the holidays, but I have no idea what it's like to go through this so I obviously would never say that...I just don't know what else to say or do.

The last guy I chatted with on Tinder was 35 and an amazing catch, and I was really excited about things. He had asked me on a date, but I had to go out of state for several months, so things didn't work out. Actually, getting that close to being with someone like him has probably gotten me in a bad mindset, raising my standards to unreasonable heights.

At this point, I'm starting to question whether it's going beyond high standards and there's some sort of underlying dysfunction I have that's getting in my way. I question whether my sex drive is too low, or if it's intimacy issues or the like. Still, I really don't have the chance to get out much or go to bars where I would find guys I'd be really interested in, so maybe that's all there is to it.

For me, dealing with my sexuality has been this crazy rollercoaster of emotions.

I used to know just where my life was going. I was excelling in school, relatively happy with my life, living up to everyone's expectations that I was this model kid. There was just one problem: I was desperately ashamed of the fact that I was gay and was afraid to admit it to myself. Then, I had denied it so long that my sanity just started to unravel. 

Things have slowly gotten better, most of family has been great about my coming out, but few people know yet. The thing is, I should be happy: I consider myself quite bright and good looking, have an incredibly supportive family, a degree from an unbelievably good school, yet as I approach my mid twenties I don't know where my life is headed anymore. I don't feel passionate about many things, I have limited social skills, no experience whatsoever with guys (but a sex drive that's through the roof), and I'm well over one hundred thousand dollars in debt in student loans studying for something I'm not even sure I want to do anymore.

And to top it all off, I think I'm so stuck inside my own head that I'm the one who's really getting in the way of my own happiness. I think I may be a little depressed, and mental illness runs in my extended family, but that is a topic that my immediate family simply does not handle well.

I've always known that I'm at least a little gay since I was about 11 when a kid brought gay porn pictures into school. It was the first porn of any kind that i ever saw. I got a boner. This was one boner of out of many others that were mostly about women I saw on TV, or crushes I had on girls at school. So, I passed it off as a one off and didn't think much of it. Fast forward to my teenage years. I developed really slow for my age, and didn't really start having strong urges until I was about 15. Porn was enough of a release for me to not even bother wanting to have sex, and it felt a bit premature when I had sex for the first time at 17 for some reason. I've always only had crushes on girls, and at 15 I only masturbated to straight porn and girls but, in this part of my life I'm sure I suppressed some of my gay thoughts, but I was always aware they were there. From about 19, I would sometimes masterbate to gay porn. I had a couple of girlfriends, and I really enjoyed the sex and I was in love with a couple of them before things turned a bit sour. I recently had one longer term girlfriend which didn't work out due to distance, but I'm still in contact with her. I've recently been masturbating about 50/50 to gay/straight porn.

The change to more gay porn happened recently when I  started to see that i've been sort of trying to watch my brain surpressing some of my thoughts by thinking about women instead, and reading gaybros to try and become more accepting of it. Reading though this sub and the internet over the years I've read about a lot of stories about how people came to realise they were gay all along after leading a straight life. This sort of makes me think that my entire lifetime of feelings and sexual desires about women might turn out to be a fallacy created in my own mind. Has this happened to anyone? Could I eventually turn out to have no feelings towards women and turn out to be totally gay? This is fine with me if it is true. Reading gaybros made me realise that everyone is just the way they are, there's nothing you can do but embrace it and follow your desires. I just find it strange because the feelings I have for women seem so real. I am sexually attracted to them, i get nervous around them. I want a wife and kids. I also don't view men as emotionally attractive at all. The thought of cuddling and showing affection with a guy seems a bit strange to me. I kind of view men as sort of rivals in some sense. However, I kind of like dick and the male body, and I have quite a strong sexual reaction to gay thoughts and porn. I've never had sex with a man though, but I do fantasize about it sometimes. I just can't imagine me liking being affectionate with a guy, even though I've really tried to imagine being in that situation. Does anyone have a similar story to share. I might be trying to give myself a label too much.

So I'll give you a brief run down:

There is only one other person on this planet that knows that I'm gay. That is an old High School friend I told via text awhile back. I remember it feeling great, like a huge weight had been lifted and I've since proceeded to have some really great conversations with her. For the first time I feel like I was really being myself. Not even just being able to talk about the 'gay stuff', like who i'm attracted to. But also things about me that I've never really been able to share before. She unfortunately moved away for work and we haven't really kept in touch.

I've sort of looked at my 'coming out' process as stages. I know it's not an over night thing and I've accepted that I'm gay although I still can't help but feel that i'm not 'proud' of it. I also know that even if I did just turn around to everyone tomorrow and said ""Hey, I'm gay."" That wouldn't be it. I think most gay people find that they're constantly 'coming out' to people. I've always thought of telling different groups of people when I felt ready and the time was right. I'd start of with some close friends &gt; My larger social group &gt; Close family &gt; Wider family. But the more I think about it. The more it seems like I'll never be ready and that makes me feel worse about being gay.

I have a great group of friends at College, who I think have their suspicions about me. I could tell my closest friends but the unknown worries me. What if it changes things? What if they begin to treat me differently? Positively or negatively. I don't want them to think of me differently because i'm gay. I'm still me. I'm just me that also happens to like dick. It doesn't change who I am. But I can't lose this feeling that if I start telling people that it'll change my relationship with them. Or what if I unearth some hidden prejudice that I didn't know about? Perhaps the latter is unlikely but the unknown is scary and feels risky. The uncertainty is worrying and it's stopping me from doing what I want to do. I want to tell people I'm gay.

I'm not sure how or if I'd be able to come out to my family. My Brother would be fine with it but I have the same worries with him as I have my close friends. Will it change things? My Dad is a pretty homophobic, I think partly because I think he also has his suspicions. It's not that I'm overtly stereo-typically gay. I just think the warning signs of things like never bringing home a girlfriend or talking about girls are already there. He wouldn't disown me but I know he'd feel tremendous shame, so I think he'd be the last I'd want to tell. My Mom would accept it. But she's previously made comments such as ""I'd be so embarrassed if one of my children were like that."" in reference to a lesbian couple she knows. So she'd also feel shame because of it. I don't want my parents to feel bad because of what I am but I know that I can't change it, as much as i'd like to, I can't.

How do I even broker the conversation? Do I go for the ""X I have something I've been wanting to tell you..."" *Insert dramatic pause* ""I'm gay."" It seems unnatural and like it would be an emotional situation to be in. Do I go for the subtle and gradually lay down hints? ""Oh he has a nice ass"" *X looks at me funny and asks if I'm gay* I respond with ""Oh yeah, didn't you know?"" The casual and confident seems more bearable, perhaps just needing some editing for when I come out to my Grandma.

I want to be proud of me, for who I am. But I'm struggling. I've been living a lie for all these years. For God sake one of my best friends thinks 'my-type' is a tall brunet with nicely defined cheek-bones. It's true! But for a guy!... The longer I wait the harder it seems to get. I question if I'll ever be ready. Maybe I just need to take a deep breathe, stop being a coward and do it. I know it'll feel great. Just to get it off my chest. Knowing people know the real me and not having to lie to to fit the mold. But the unknown is holding me back. I don't want me being gay to change anything or make anyone feel uncomfortable. What should I do? 

Am I ready to 'Come out'?

Thanks for reading my essay, and sorry it's longer than I thought it was going to be. It's good to get it all of my chest at least. I've been a lurker on this sub-forum for awhile and know there is a fantastic gay community on here. &lt;3 If you fellow GayBro's have any questions I'll be happy to try and answer them.

I hope you're all enjoying the Holidays. :)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I imagine the instant reaction to this question would be that it depends on your own individual circumstances. So I&amp;#39;ll give you a brief run down:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is only one other person on this planet that knows that I&amp;#39;m gay. That is an old High School friend I told via text awhile back. I remember it feeling great, like a huge weight had been lifted and I&amp;#39;ve since proceeded to have some really great conversations with her. For the first time I feel like I was really being myself. Not even just being able to talk about the &amp;#39;gay stuff&amp;#39;, like who i&amp;#39;m attracted to. But also things about me that I&amp;#39;ve never really been able to share before. She unfortunately moved away for work and we haven&amp;#39;t really kept in touch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve sort of looked at my &amp;#39;coming out&amp;#39; process as stages. I know it&amp;#39;s not an over night thing and I&amp;#39;ve accepted that I&amp;#39;m gay although I still can&amp;#39;t help but feel that i&amp;#39;m not &amp;#39;proud&amp;#39; of it. I also know that even if I did just turn around to everyone tomorrow and said &amp;quot;Hey, I&amp;#39;m gay.&amp;quot; That wouldn&amp;#39;t be it. I think most gay people find that they&amp;#39;re constantly &amp;#39;coming out&amp;#39; to people. I&amp;#39;ve always thought of telling different groups of people when I felt ready and the time was right. I&amp;#39;d start of with some close friends &amp;gt; My larger social group &amp;gt; Close family &amp;gt; Wider family. But the more I think about it. The more it seems like I&amp;#39;ll never be ready and that makes me feel worse about being gay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a great group of friends at College, who I think have their suspicions about me. I could tell my closest friends but the unknown worries me. What if it changes things? What if they begin to treat me differently? Positively or negatively. I don&amp;#39;t want them to think of me differently because i&amp;#39;m gay. I&amp;#39;m still me. I&amp;#39;m just me that also happens to like dick. It doesn&amp;#39;t change who I am. But I can&amp;#39;t lose this feeling that if I start telling people that it&amp;#39;ll change my relationship with them. Or what if I unearth some hidden prejudice that I didn&amp;#39;t know about? Perhaps the latter is unlikely but the unknown is scary and feels risky. The uncertainty is worrying and it&amp;#39;s stopping me from doing what I want to do.

I usually just lurk but instead of writing in a notepad what I am feeling - why not reach out to an online community and seek some advice from actual people? 

I don't want to talk about my problems with friends or family anymore because I am starting to think I am the one who is bringing down the room when people ask how I am - I just have started saying as many positive things about my life to friends because I don't want to be that guy anymore.

I came out two year this coming April so I am pretty new to this life at 24. I seem to be going through things that I feel 16 - 19yr old gay me would of been going through if I came out quicker. Feel like I am behind and yet so many things are happening that I have to deal with.

I moved out to be closer to my boyfriend and work (Manhattan vs Staten Island) to a less than desirable neighborhood in Brooklyn. I was basically living with my boyfriend and the move had to be made because I needed my own space instead of living out of a backpack. My job doesn't pay really well, it just is at a highly regarded company that everyone knows so I said what the hell, who cares about a neighborhood. It seemed like the right move with having a real full time job, having a relationship that you think was going somewhere, and wanting to develop a life for myself. 

I was broken up two months after the move on our one year anniversary because he was going away to focus on his career and is doing extremely well. I think about him a lot and wish him the best. The relationship needed to end for him to do his thing but there is still some stupid hope there. 

I on the other hand sunk into a deep depression that I ended up losing ten pounds (going from 150 to 140 is pretty ridiculous for my height), hate my neighborhood because of how depressing and far it is from things. Nobody really wants to visit. My job has turned into me just googling things for eight hours, feeling like a robot day-in-day-out and the co-workers are not my type of people and are just overall terrible. I have been rejected left and right when applying for new jobs - Bachelor of Communications, don't do it bros. I miss my friends from SI, it is tough to get people out here in far out Brooklyn or even the city with their lives on Staten Island so I tried to make new friends and I did but it just isn't the same. It got pretty fucking lonely really quickly. I have a strong sense of family and home and my boyfriend was both of those, which is an issue that I fixed with the dependence on one person, that is far too much pressure.

I did casual hookups and the one night stand life for a bit but that made me feel even more lonely so I was introduced to a friend of a friend and we hit it off and started dating in the summer, he was moving away to grad school in the fall and I was highly against doing long distance but I was talked into it by him and we did it and were doing it. It sucked and was hard but we saw each other once a weekend for the next three months and I visited him for a week in October. When I went to visit, the last night, after a fabulous visit that helped solidify the relationship for me, we decided to go dancing and went to a gay club where we both were VERY intoxicated and I lost him in the crowd. I found him, ontop of another guy, making out with him. I threw him off and stormed out into the unknown city I was. He later found me roaming and I couldn't even look at him so I slept on his couch and was driven to the airport in the morning. This has really affected me. It hasn't been as bad as the first breakup, this one is more like..What the fuck. Is this real life? Felt like a shitty gay movie. It was actually the first time I had any self-hate with the whole gay thing and I have known I have been gay since puberty. 

I started drinking. WAY to much. I am going to change that though. Blacking out is not cool and is just not who I want to be. 

I know that things that would make me happy and that is a new apartment and new job but a new apartment would come from a new job because I need a higher salary. Should I just get up and move to another cheaper city? I do not know if I am cut out for the paycheck to paycheck life to have the opportunity to live in New York.

I tried just hanging out, getting a drink with some new guys but I just can't do it. I starting being very flaky when talking to guys and in all honestly and I am not trying to sound like a douche but dates are easy to come by. I just don't want it and that makes me sad. 

TL;DR: Went through two rough breakups, job sucks, apartment sucks, friendships suck, is this it?

If this was you, what would be your plan of action? I just..don't know how to..live? My life right now just feels very..is this it?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This post got longer that I thought it would..&lt;/p&gt;

I'm a closeted guy on the first half of my twenties and earlier today my younger brother told me that this xmas my sister said to my parents that I *might* be going to some gay bar downtown. He also told me my mother asked my father to watch where I was going to yesterday night, but in the end he didn't try to spy on me, what caused my mother to be rather upset at him. She also tried to press me into telling where I was going to, but it didn't work either.

Though I probably had seen it coming, I don't know exactly what to make up of all this. By the way he told me, it looks to me that my brother and sister just treat it like some weird joke, while my father either doesn't care or doesn't want to know and my very religious mother doesn't want to believe it. 
Basically everyone in family are homophobes, especially my mother who most likely would try to ""cure"" me and pray away the gay, so I'm not sure I should tell them the truth should they come up-front and ask me straight. Even though I'm the sole financially stable member of the family and could afford to move out (perhaps to another country), I don't want to damage my relationship with my family too much. Even if it doesn't seems possible anymore.

Observations of this ratio were made in various states and different settings (urban, rural, etc.). Calculations were performed to illustrate this point, and some possible explanations for the discrepancies were provided. Why do you think this is?

**Introduction:** I am a 22 year old white male that uses many gay dating apps to look for guys. Some of these include Grindr, Jack'd, Tinder, and Adam4Adam. What I have noticed on these sites is that, despite being in a predominantly white areas, there are very few white guys using these dating apps compared to people of color (hereafter POC). **THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM**, I just merely wish to discuss this point, and what may be the reason behind this.


**2010 Census Data:** All of the following numbers were obtained from the 2010 census information (www.census.gov/2010census/data/). 

1. Total U.S. population: 308,745,538 (100%)

1. Male Population: 151,781,326 (49.16%)

1. White (non hispanic) Population: 196,817,552 (63.75%)

1. Black Population: 38,929,319 (12.6%)

1. Latino/Hispanic Population: 50,477,594 (16.35%)

**Expected Populations:** These values were calculated using the census data. 

1. White AND Male: 96,760,595 (31.34%)

1. Black AND Male: 19,124,447 (6.19%)

1. Hispanic AND Male: 24,816,247 (8.04%)

**Gay Population:** These numbers were calculated using the expected populations. It is estimated that 5% of the population is LGBT. For the sake of this post, we will assume that 5% of the male population is *just gay*.

1. Gay White Males: 4,838,028 (1.57%)

1. Gay Black Males: 956,222 (0.31%)

1. Gay Hispanic Males: 1,240,812 (0.4%)

**Assumptions:** To justify these calculations, it is assumed that there is an equal distribution of men throughout all races. It is also assumed that there is an equal distribution of homosexual men throughout all races. Finally, it is assumed that the distribution of race and gay men is uniform across all age groups and geographic locations.

**Results:** Based on these numbers, you would expect to see about 1 gay Hispanic for every 4 gay Whites, or 1 gay Black for every 5 gay Whites. However this is not the ratio that exists on dating apps. Personally, I have observed this trend when using the aforementioned dating apps in multiple locations (urban, rural, suburbs, etc.) across several midwest states. Additionally, with Adam4Adam you can view any location at any time, not just where you are at the moment. Thus, there must be some cultural influence that causes white men to be under-represented on gay dating apps.

**Possible Explanations:** Here are some ideas I have for why the ratio of whites to POC on gay dating apps does not follow the population distribution.

1. White males are traditionally more likely to be conservative and Christian. Thus, white males are less likely to be comfortable with being gay and less likely to come out because it conflicts with their religious/political beliefs.

1. Historically, POC have faced racism and oppression, whereas Whites have always been the majority. Whites are less likely to come out because that would make them a ""minority"" and they might then face discrimination for the first time. By remaining in the closet they can continue to be ""normal"" in the eyes of society, and never have to face oppression.

1. POC, especially Hispanics, traditionally place more emphasis on their family. POC may be more likely to come out at an early age because their family/culture provides them with a better support group than their white peers have.

Just a silly little question for you all!

What would you think if you found that the guy you're dating plays with Lego? Sad, pathetic, too childish and an instant turn off for you? Or cute, sweet and a big thumbs up from you?

I spent Christmas with the family and found an old box of lego from my childhood. I can't resist it! So, it got me thinking about this. Personally, I think everyone should do whatever they want to - especially when it's something silly like Lego! But, thought I'd see what everyone else thinks (mainly because I'm doing nothing else right now!)


So, if you find that your S/O or guy you've started dating plays with Lego, what would you think?

He replied that he was flattered but obviously disinterested and we continued on being friends.

For the past year our friendship has continued to grow and my crush has lingered, though I've done a good job at keeping it quiet and focusing my interests elsewhere.  Tomorrow, we're to attend a Murder Mystery Dinner for a friend's birthday hosted and planned by my crush.  The way he's laid it out, my crush will be playing the role of a closeted gay man who sleeps around with a lot of women but whom ultimately has his heart set on my character.  My character, a straight man who ""has no problems with gays as long as they keep it to themselves"" is scripted to murder my crush's character as retaliation for being pursued by the closeted gay man.

I find this to be a really odd and specific paring given that, of all the attendees, I'm the only gay man in attendance.  I also realize however that I have a tendency to over think things and I know how common it is to read into things that aren't actually there when a crush is involved.

*Please* tell me I'm over thinking this situation.  I really need an outside voice on this one.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quick background:  I had the typical straight friend crush on a guy and told him as much last Valentine&amp;#39;s Day in a double scotch-emboldened text.  He replied that he was flattered but obviously disinterested and we continued on being friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past year our friendship has continued to grow and my crush has lingered, though I&amp;#39;ve done a good job at keeping it quiet and focusing my interests elsewhere.

As a lesbian, it seems that bedding a straight girl is rather simple. I believe this is because of three reasons:

- They like experimenting
- It's another girl so... it doesn't count?
- Women are really competitive among eachother, so the mere suggestion that she doesn't know what she's doing, makes her even more enthusiastic.

So I'm just curious... Are straight guys the same?

And yes, I do think that you can consider yourself straight and still enjoy a bit of gay sex every now and then. No biggie.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I tried to think of a better title, but... nah.&lt;/p&gt;
