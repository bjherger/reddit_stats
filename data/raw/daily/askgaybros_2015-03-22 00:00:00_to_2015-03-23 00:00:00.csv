Why is it that the very people we scout for in the digital age already have the inclination to hurt you. They say that gays want equal rights. Do you believe that? I don't because if they did you would not see gays of all ages acting the way they do. Let’s take a look at some of the behaviors. First and foremost gays size up a potential partner within the first 5 seconds of meeting. Their criteria is age, sex yes or no? or just friends.There is no such thing as getting to know someone. I can definitely understand if you attracted to someone that is a given. You are attracted to what you are attracted to. So why is this irrelevant criteria used to sort out potential boyfriends. I have a theory, it sounds weird but clear your head of what you think you know. At what age do most gays come out of the closet? I am not saying come out to other people but come out to themselves. Most do so around the college age because they are away from their families. Usually that is in the span of 20 to 25. How many of you think that this is good? I would guess that at least 60% would agree. It’s not and here is why. All of the behaviors of finding a mate is usually in high school. Passing notes in class holding hands while walking down the hall, going out on dates. Do you see what I am getting at? The gay guys in high school do not participate in these behaviors because they are in fear of their safety and protecting their secret from everyone. Even though being gay in the last ten years is not only accepted it is considered cool. Still hiding ones gayness has been the norm from jr high all through high school. and changing a person's habitual habits is a monumental feat. So where does that leave us? Now all the guys from high school head to college. Not only are they exposed to a high range of diversity but they come into a plethora of other guys who are going through the change. Again you probably think this is cool. It’s not, these guys are coming out are at an extreme emotional and behavioral disadvantage. Look at their straight counterparts. Straight couples have professed their love from the rooftop, had sexual relations that everybody knew about and accepted. What do the gay guys have? Nothing but a blank slate and no clue how to rectify that. During high school gays were so worried about someone finding out that they are gay they fail to study the ground work for relationships. Most likely gays would avert their gaze of a straight couple in fear of being caught looking at a straight boy. Even though straights want to express their sexuality anything other than a passing glance could get you in allot of trouble So where are we at? Gays are searching for the correct behavior so that they may fit into society. Unfortunately gay college students get it wrong. Out of all the behaviors they have to choose from they choose the worst of the worst. The worst is deceit, lying has been the norm for so long that is the top of their skills. Even though saying the truth will most likely be a harmless consequence,they still do it. Another one is promiscuity, yes some straight guys are also sluts but not as bad as these gays. The fact that college gays have not learned how to have a relationship the act of having multiple partners is no way to fill that void. No mind you if you ask any number of freshly out college gays what do they want out of a gay relationship the answer will astound you. "" I want a meaningful fulfilling monogamous relationship"".What a load of crap,an oxymoron right. These individuals are in for a rude awakening. Most Likely after 25 the rug gets pulled out from under them. All of a sudden most of them have an epiphany. They want real relationships and the playing field is baron and dry.After which depression sets in and possibly suicide. This generation is the worst generation of all time. In the seventies we had the stonewall riots to stop anti gay attacks. The nineties  we had don't ask don't tell.Today because most states have legalized same sex marriage nobody is trying to better the situation. The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments on gay marriage this term. What is the point? The current generation is not mentally able to abide by the rules of marriage why fight for it.The most abundant group of people applying for marriage licenses are lesbians and gay guys age 50 and up. The LGBT should not be worried about where to have the next dance but work to save this generation from self destruct.   Some may ask how did I fair through those years. I admitted to myself that I was gay at about 12. I went through this malarky early on so when I was in my twenties I knew what a real relationship was.Here is an example of what brought me here to begin with. For the past few weeks I was quasi relationship with a guy, we will call him Brian. Brian was 23 and he and I were inseparable over the phone. I was planning on cultivating a wonderful relationship.I have never physicall met him but we got to know each other quite well,so I thought.One morning I woke up and all the text messaging were stopped and contact deleted. I was told that this would never work out and I was acting like his keeper and I mad him feel stupid. My gut told me that he was always looking for something better. Not a positive attribute because this behavior will burn you in the end. There was definitely someone on the sidelines pushing me out to take my spot. At first I was devastated but as the days passed and the aforementioned argument seems to be quite accurate. The statement that I was told was ""I am 23 and  indecisive"".

OK so this has been a roller coaster weekend. My BF Justin had called my parents Friday afternoon to thank them profusely for their offer of a free room (my older brother's former bedroom, but he can't sleep in my bedroom, and no sex in the house, in case you didn't read my original post). My dad had his phone on speaker so I go to hear it all. Justin laid on the charm and even spontaneously threw in""Your house, your rules"" (even though I know he was thinking ""Until you go out for dinner... and then I will fuck your son first on the breakfast nook table and then on the kitchen counter""). He also said that he would pay for his own food. My parents thanked him for his ""respect"" and added that there was no need to buy his own food or pay for anything as he would be a guest in the house. That was cool. Saturday morning, my dad came into my room and said that he and my mom had changed their mind about the arrangement. I immediately assumed that he meant that the whole deal was off and I started crying uncontrollably and begging. My dad asked me to calm down and said that what he meant was that Justin could definitely still stay free for the summer... and that we could share my bedroom if that is what we wanted. I just sat stunned for what seemed like forever and then broke down crying again. My mom came rushing in at that point and I managed to pull myself together enough to thank them both so much. My mom added that they recognize that we had already been sharing a room for 8 months and that trying to treat me like a child would be ""cruel"" (her words!). They got up to leave, and my dad (the eternal smartass, and I love him for it) added that I should call Justin now and make sure the new plan was OK with him. He added: ""Because maybe he was actually looking forward to having a room all to himself for a change?"" and then winked at me. Needless to say Justin was totally geeked about this. He even suggested that we should keep things cool except when they were out of the house. That's fine with me. I think that most of the responses on this thread were really focused on sex. That was not my emphasis or biggest concern. We've already passed our two year anniversary and have done everything sexual a zillion times.

I'm a 19 y/old gay guy.


2 weeks ago I went to a gay bar,alone for the 1st time..Met a couple of
guys(mostly late 20's-30)and they became my ""gay bar buddies"" and 
I got to talk to some of their  acquaintances.Fun night.

Last night I came again.Still with my fairly older bar buddies.It was
fairly dead,probably half as much people 2 weeks ago.However I still
saw some cute guys I could have approached,but I didn't know how to. 
It was a gay bar/disco. What should have I done? Just randomly dance with 
them? Grind on? That would be too creepy. I'm still getting used to this 
gay scene thing and how things work around here.

Not bragging but I think I'm conventionally ""handsome""  and I have
a fairly solid shape. It's just that I'm shy around strangers. I was 
using my bar buddies as my safety net due to my shyness,I just stuck
with them the whole time.Maybe the guys who could have been interested 
in me thought i was already dating one of them so they didn't bother 
approach me?  What could I do next time around?

My boyfriend and I are both 23 and have been together for just a little over 4 months. We met on Grindr, and talked for about 6 months before meeting each other. When we finally met, it was immediately clear that we were good together. We waited a month to have sex, which I think was great for our relationship, in that we got to know each other without the initial thrill of sex being in the way. Since then, we've had sex 15 times at the most. It's something we've discussed many times before. We both have moderately serious mental health issues and take medication for it, which inhibits libido. His dosage, however, is much higher than mine and lowers his libido to the point that we have not had sex in three weeks. We made the decision to buy a vibrator about a month ago to aid in the sexual health of our relationship. Neither of us has ever owned a sex toy, and we've used it together twice since then. 

Although my libido is much lower than it was before I started taking medication, I am still finding a void in both my need for affection and sex from the person that I love. I believe and trust everything that he has explained to me about the issues he has, but I can't help but to feel terrible about it and myself, and I don't know what to do about that.

Sorry this is so long.

About two months ago, I realized I was gay.  I was disgusted, scared and wanted answers.  It took some time, but just recently I've gotten over it.  Anyway this was before I got over it.  So I've already been recruited to play collegiate baseball at a Division-1 school (I won't name names), so I've slacked off a bit in my classes.  Anyway, we had a very big test in calc after a long weekend and I didn't get to study for it, because I was at my future college.  Anyway, I just totally bombed the test and asked my teacher if he would give me an extension.  At first, he was hesitant, then he asked me if I was doing all right because I seem really disconnected in class.  I don't really know why, but I just broke down - I couldn't handle not telling anyone that I was gay. He seemed very concerned and, something I thought was a little weird, he gave me his number and told me that I could call or text anytime if I needed something.  So I got the extension until the following Monday and being the procrastinator I was I didn't even start studying until Sunday.  While I was studying, I couldn't figure out how to do a certain set of problems.  So I figured I'd text my teacher and ask him.  He sent me some info, but I still didn't get it.  I asked him if I could come in early tomorrow morning and he could show me.  Then he said that his wife and son were gone and that I could come over now, if I wanted, and he could show me now.  Needing the help I went.  When I got there, he offered me a soda and told me he just grilled up some burgers and that I could have some if I wanted.  So we ate and he taught, but while he was teaching I just couldn't take my eyes off of him.  He is very attractive.  He had been a football player, so he is stocky, but it is all muscle.  He has blond hair, blue eyes, and he is probably in his early forties.  After about five minutes of staring at him, I threw myself on him and we had sex.  I bottomed (I have since topped) and was virgin.  He was big too, so it hurt a lot.  The next day, I took the test and I'm pretty sure I did't actually do well, but he gave me an A.  The next few days were awkward, I think he was scared I would get him in trouble.  I sent him a text saying that I didn't want to get him in trouble because he's a really good teacher and I didn't think he deserved it.  I told him I wasn't going to hold it against him, he needs to quit seeing it as black and white and more gray.  I also said I had a great time and thanked him for being understanding.  Three days later he asked if I wanted to do it again.  And then another time.  And then another time.  So we've been hooking up once or twice a week for about six weeks now.  Either at his house or a hotel room outside of town (my house is too risky).  We delete all of each other messages and don't even use contact names for each other.  We were keeping it very secretive until about a week ago.  He pays for the hotel room in cash, but has to give them his address if something goes wrong.  So one of the hotels, sent him a letter thanking him for his recent stays and his wife opened it.  She is a very active church member, so we get together while she is at church with his son, but now she is questioning him and is keeping watch.  I'm starting to get kind of nervous for him because I don't want anything bad to happen.  I'm also starting to think I need to end things with him.  The problem is that I really like him, not just sexually, but as a person.  I know it's going to end when I leave for college, but right now it's fun and exciting.  He says he hasn't been happy like this in a long time.  Is there any way I can keep things going, or do I need to end it?


BTW: I am older than the age of consent and we have been practicing safe sex, but there is such a thing as public humiliation and there is a school policy that if a teacher is having sexual relations with a student, he/she can be fired.

The first reason why is that I don't typically look like the typical guy most other guys are looking for (in other words, I'm overweight. Not obese but the gut/moobs are definitely noticeable). Also, I'm kind of awkward and therefore it's hard for me to let loose and feel comfortable dancing around other people. 

More often than not, I have a mediocre or crappy time at gay clubs   or bars that are very cruise-y or have dancefloors. Whenever I feel that way, I regret that I didn't just stay home and watch Broad City or smoke a bowl or something. But this scene is the scene of almost all of my gay male friends, so if I suggested doing something other than clubbing or even just going to a quieter bar, they wouldn't be up for it.

So maybe what I need to do is just find a way to enjoy myself more at these bars, because I still want to hang out with these friends on the weekends. I think I could enjoy myself at these places more if I just felt sexier and more confident.

FIRST POST EVER ON REDDIT! WELCOME ME! ;)

So there's this guy in my uni who's my junior and I find him really cute with his husky voice and the way he walks. *sigh* 
He goes in the same bus as me. I struck up conversation with him, he seemed nice, exchanged numbers, added on FB and now we have talked a few times about hobbies, etc. He's very nice. 

So today I told him I thought he was cute. He asked me to explain why I thought that, so I did. He seemed to be freaking out a little (in a way that said that he'd never heard it from a guy before) and I told him it was okay if he wasn't into it. But didn't actually show any revulsion. Either he's gay or just open-minded. So, I offered to take him out after exams, and he said ""I'll consider this option"". 

Here are my questions.

1. How can I find out early on if he is fully hetero and just trying this as an experiment?
2. If he really is either of those, what should I do?

I've never actually approached a stranger like this. Every time I've been with a guy (in any capacity), it was he that initiated it, not I. How does this stuff work? I'm clueless. Help appreciated.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi. FIRST POST EVER ON REDDIT! WELCOME ME! ;)&lt;/p&gt;

We have yet to make it official as in having the boyfriend title, but I think we really like each other. We sleep in each other's houses once a week at least unless he's really busy or has family over. We watch shows together. Intense cuddling. Go out on dates. Yadda yadaa. I brought the question up to him really early when we were dating, so I let him know I was interested, but he said we should go on more dates and such, and we sure have. I don't know if I should bring it up again at this point, or how to do it. I kinda feel if I get rejected four months in, it would be time for me to move on. Thing is we don't have any disagreements. We're a fine couple, never had problems together, whatever. So hearing him say that he's not ready after four months will make it seem like he's not interested.

It doesn't seem like he has told any of his friends that he is dating me. He doesn't do stuff with his friends too often, but he told me he was going to have his current location friends meet some of his hometown friends.. It was kind of hurtful to not be included as one of these friends, even if we are dating. I'm not too upset about it because I can see how it can be awkward..

Here's what kind of set my alarms off a little bit that made me think he was ashamed.. One time he liked my photo on IG but then unliked it about a minute or so later. It was a picture I took of me in his bathroom. I texted him saying ""thanks for liking and unlocking my picture"" and he said he didn't want to seem like a creep which did not make sense, cuz he has a bunch of guys on IG that he likes old pictures of (and mine was only like 2-3 weeks old at the time). I felt like he figured that if people saw him liking the pic, that they would question why I was in his bathroom (it's a distinguishable bathroom).  

Another alarm was set off for me today. I commented on his pic with the exact words that were on his shirt, being funny (something along the lines of I need to be drunk to talk to you). He deleted it and so I asked him why he deleted my comment. He said because it was rude, although I was just saying what the words on the shirt said - a pretty tame joke. So I commented again saying ""I don't need to be drunk to talk to you"" pretty much the opposite of what the shirt said. He called me a dork, kept it on there for a little bit, then deleted it. 

It sounds really petty, and I realize now how social networks are poisonous to relationships. Am I wrong to comment on his pictures? Should I bring it up? How should I handle this situation? Anyone have experience with this? Should I unfollow him? Sometimes I think to myself - yeah maybe I shouldn't like his pictures or comment on em.. a part of me wants to slap myself for making a big deal out of this garbage.
