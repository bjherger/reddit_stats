I've been talking to a guy I met on a chat site for 6 months (I know bear with me)…and we hit off, talk usually every weekend. Its mostly friendly…I had some lingering romantic feelings for a moment, but we cleared the air of those, knowing it wasn't realistic due to distance, schedule, etc.    
We have lengthy and in depth convos to the wee hours, sharing thoughts, metaphorically braiding each others hair…no real sexy fun times on cam, other than flashing teases of underwear (pre-airing out the romantic feelings)…

So, the only thing is…he won't tell me his last name.    
Like…steadfast about not telling me, because he ""has issues and is extremely closeted/paranoid"". (I myself am relatively out, but choose not to advertise)    
But…I've talked to this guy. Seen him cry. Made plans to visit him across state. Hell, seen each others underwear…I know he has issues, and I feel like I respect those boundaries...    
But, I'm having trouble processing the fact he won't tell me upfront, when I've been upfront and honest about all my life aspects…name included.

Plus…he's lied/withheld before.    
- He told me his first name was X when it was really Y…ok, well at least he came clean.    
- Told me he was this age, but turns out to be 7 years older than that. (I'm 29) Hmm...age not a huge factor for me after thinking about it...    
- Minor own up: wearing colored contacts after I've commented on his eyes…not a huge thing, but some more insight I think.    
- He'll even cover up pictures of his family/friends when we've shown each other throwback pictures for laughs…like, am I going to know them or something?    
- He says he has no social media...not impossible...but still an eyebrow raiser considering this day/age.

So…I've asked him on three separate occasions for his last name…just to know, not a big deal but also…well…significant when getting to know a person…especially after 6 months I think.    
I brought it up again, and he still wouldn't after I flat out told him it bothered me, then had to let it go because I was beating the dead horse.    
This time…it just…ate away at me. I was through with the ""lying""…so i tried to break contact because I felt like he was being a bad friend, and wasn't comfortable where this was going.    
Then back peddled, because I thought it was fair for him to say his peace too…

We have a heavy blow out, I explain all my feelings and he still won't tell me, and has an excuse for everything. He also tells me he's super depressed, and I feel guilty, and fix that situation best as possible...    
But still tell him I think we shouldn't talk anymore because this all seems to be getting us nowhere.    
We ended things. No real closure per say…but an end at least…I don't know…still processing.


But…was I right in my thinking? Or am I in the wrong, blowing this out of proportion…its not that I care about his last name that in depth…its about the fact he's withholding and won't be honest when I ask him.

Details:
  
We're both 21; he has a kid from a previous relationship; he's never messed around with a guy before.  
We started sending each other nudes around 2 years ago, there's been plenty of sexting since then, and the physical attraction is mutual.  
He's very nervous about doing sexual things with a man, quite understandably, and I am trying my best to make things easy for him.  
  
We hung out last night: dinner, casino, beach, pier, ice cream, drinks. It was an awesome night. I didn't want to rush anything, but as we were falling asleep (he slept on the futon in my room) the conversation turned sexual and he tried his best to suggest in his own round-about way that I wake him with morning head.

• Some sources say that the cost of a Truvada prescription is usually around $1000 / month. A lot of other sources say that most insurance companies actually cover PrEP. For everyone on PrEP, what has your experience like been financially?

• I was talking to an acquaintance the other day that mentioned his PrEP is free because he's part of a vaccine study. Does anyone know of any national PrEP studies that are taking participants (links would be appreciated!)?

• I know there are different drugs and combinations to deal with HIV but are there different kinds of PrEP? Truvada is specifically a combination of tenofovir and emtricitabine. What is the best most protective PrEP on the market right now? 

• How should I talk to my doctor about this? A friend who's on Truvada as PrEP said I should just tell my doctor that I'm dating an HIV positive person...

• Lastly, what was everyone's personal experience in acquiring PrEP? What was the process for you? How long did it take? How was your experience with your healthcare provider? How was your experience with your insurer?

Even though I am intellectually ok with an open relationship, we just aren&amp;#39;t there yet.... and the fact that he talks about his sexual compulsion in such a way that he recognizes it as a problem, he doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be willing to do anything about it. Am I just overreacting? I am in recovery myself... I get relapses happen and things take time, but there has to be a certain point where working on our relationship is more important than random anonymous sex, right? Anyone else been in this situation? What&amp;#39;s a reasonable resolution without being the bad guy of just flat out saying &amp;quot;no&amp;quot;? I&amp;#39;ve never dealt with someone with sexual compulsion.... I don&amp;#39;t know how to help and what is just enabling. Feedback? Thoughts? I can foresee a future with this guy, but I don&amp;#39;t want to get my feelings trampled, nor do I just want to enable his self-destructive behaviors. I just feel a bit lost. Some words of encouragement would be nice....&lt;/p&gt;

(I read an eerily similar post here a couple months ago, but I can't find it now, I'd really like to talk to that guy who posted.) 

Anywho, since we broke up last November, I have been very casually out to meet new people. I have used the apps and go out pretty frequently too. I travel around Florida a lot and it seems to be pretty common all over the state. I'm sure you're aware of the ""no blacks, etc"" in apps and posts, but did you know that people will also flat out refuse to talk to us in person, too? Apparently its pretty common to completely turn people down and not talk to them based on race. 

Those who didn't flat out refuse to talk to me *really* wanted some black dick tonight. Its like I'm either hated for being black or fetished for. I'm still pretty jaded about the break up last year so I've been mostly looking for friends, but not opposed to hookups, and I always make that clear.

I feel like something deep inside of me is making me suddenly find white guys less attractive than other races. I don't even want to approach or message a white guy for fear of being reminded that blacks are inferior to their race. I have always grown up in a diverse place (south florida) and my friends and dates have always been of all kinds of races. My family has never taught me any type of hate based on race. I was out of the dating scene for a few years while in this relationship, and when I came back 3 years later everyone suddenly hates/fetishes black guys? Is this a new thing? Because it certainly didn't seem to be this way 4 years ago... everyone was much nicer and accepting back then.

I lurk here a lot so I'm really not trying to turn this into a R vs P discussion. I'm just wondering if anyone else here has had a breakup over racial issues and how did it affect you? I never want to be the guy to turn someone down based on their race but I am noticing things like this happening subconsciously in my thought process. Is this something that I should seek counseling for?

We instantly clicked as friends after meeting at a  summer job 4 years ago. We are now 22 and 23 and I consider him one of my very best and closest despite living in different states. Though I'm closeted I think I have a pretty good gaydar and he never registered so much as a blip. I have thought of him sexually because he is very very goodlooking,  muscular, and the ultimate bro but it is nothing I thought would realistically happen anymore than me finding a billion dollars laying around. 

Anyway, he's in town visiting and last night after smoking some weed we were chilling on the couch watching tv. We've always been affectionate with one another, so I didn't think anything of it when I felt his leg rest on mine. We were laying feet to feet at one point and he's much taller than I so when he stretched out his leg it was over mine but whatever. So I get that feeling you get when someone is looking at you so I look at him to find him staring at me with this weird look on his face. I say ""The fuck you looking at?"" He doesn't say anything so I'm like whatever and go back to watching whatever we're watching. I know he's still looking at me so I look back at him and say ""Seriously what's your deal?"" and he is just looking me in the eye very intensely. Then he starts rubbing his dick. In my mind ""I'm like whoa, that's hot."" but I say ""Dude, what the fuck?"" and sit up. He guiltily asks if that made me uncomfortable and I say yes and he says sorry. It felt pretty awkward for what seemed like an eternity until we ended up rolling up another blunt before falling asleep.
