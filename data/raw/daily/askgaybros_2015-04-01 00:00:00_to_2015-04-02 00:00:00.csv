But now that im single again; starting to use grindr and such; i want to find a way to get on PrEP. I dont plan to bareback; i just really fear being taken advantage of; top not using a condom; or even condom breaking. and ive lined up enough guys interested (nobody seems free on weekdays) that it would be worth while to get on PReP

Basically; where do i start?
i wish this was more common; like birth control. and obviously my parents dont know the first thing about PrEP. But i do have very good health insurance; and i am open so getting my parents approval wouldnt be a big issue.

But just; how does one end up on PrEP?
all these websites show having to apply; or submit some kind of documentation for why i need it. But isnt it enough being a 20 year old MSM; thats pretty much the highest risk category right?. 
would i have luck just discussing this with my family doctor?
or do i need to hunt out a PrEP clinic that will help me


im sorry if this information is easily available somewhere; and im sorry if its asked a TON; but it is a very confusing topic full of outdated information already. But its gotten so confusing that im almost about to give up and just do hookups; praying for the best. It shouldnt be this confusing especially for an embarrasing drug to ask for.

this is the part that concerns me

Meet one of the following risk factors: 
Have a partner or partners known to be HIV-1 infected

OR 

Be a gay/bisexual/other man, or transgender person, who has sex with men in a high HIV prevalence area or social network and has one or more of the following conditions:

A diagnosis of a bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the last year
Exposure to an STI through a sexual network in the last year
Ten or more sexual partners in the last year
Used methamphetamine in the last year
Had unprotected anal intercourse with a partner of unknown HIV-1 status with any of the factors listed above.

i dont really meet any of those categories; i guess no harm in lying about the 10 sexual partners; i assume with grindr i will hit that soon

Hi. I got super shitfaced this past Saturday, and I had a guy over (20, just a young frat boy). It wasn't the first time we've had sex, but previously we were safe. This time, I was drunk and didn't ""mandate"" the use of condoms. So - barebacking happened. He didn't cum inside me, just fucked then jerked off afterwards.

Apparently the risk of HIV transmission is low (but still existent) - clearly it's happened, so I can't go back now, but numbers/comments might help ease the mind. Also the fact that he's 20 helps a bit in my head. Thoughts?

I'm a bit of a lurker, but this seems like a chill subreddit so I figured this might be the place to explain my dilemma and get some advice.  After five years together, my partner left me a couple months ago.  Since the breakup, I noticed that my dynamics with my gay male friends have gotten weird.  It seems like my friends who are in relationships are acting different around me, like divorce is contagious, or that I am pining after their boyfriends, and my single friends all seem to want in my pants.  Even the guys I dated before my ex are suddenly resurfacing.  I really don't want to relive my past, or have things get weird with my friends.  When I do decide to resume sexual activity, I would prefer it to be with people who I don't already know.  Has this happened to anyone else after the end of a LTR, and how did you handle it?  I'm a pretty nice guy, and it's hard for me to reject advances because I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings.

Thanks!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good evening gaybros,&lt;/p&gt;

I'm 18 year old college student and I have been gay for as long as I can remember. I remember as early as the fifth grade liking guys but I didn't really know what ""being gay"" was until the middle of my sixth grade year. I don't want to come out to my parents or anyone I know because I feel as if I will be treated different, and no one would want to be around me. To make matters worse, I have social anxiety and I have never had any true friends. I have always been to myself and I never put the effort in to make any friends, as I thought no one would like me, and I am horrible at conversations. I don't feel like I fit in anywhere, but yet my straight twin brother (we are fraternal twins so we don't look alike), has always been liked by everyone, has had multiple girlfriends, played football in high school, and is going to be joining a fraternity next year at a large public college in the Southeast. I'm a decent looking guy, and there is nothing that bad about me. However, I have never had a boyfriend and I only had one girlfriend my freshman year of high school (we only went out for a week). At that time, I wasn't at terms with my sexuality and I was never attracted to this girl. I have never kissed anyone, let alone touch anyone. I have no one I can talk to and I feel trapped. I don't have a job, no car, and the only people I even talk to is my ultra-conservative uncle, my parents, and my brother. I am extremely depressed, and everyone around me is starting to notice. I have been on anti-depressants but they only help so much. Some days, I just want to pack up everything and leave my life behind for good. Granted, I have a great relationship with my family, but I don't think they will truly accept me for who I am. However, my dad's aunt is a lesbian and her partner of 30 years just passed away in May. I never had a close relationship with them for me to come out to them, but I feel even she won't be of any help. I feel as if I were to come out to everyone, my life wouldn't change, and it wouldn't be any easier to find a boyfriend due to me having social anxiety. I just want to wake up one day and have my life do a complete 360. I just want someone to come up to me and have a genuine conversation. I hope one day I can be like everyone else around me and have a social life, and maybe one day, a boyfriend. I'm so desperate at this point that I'm willing to hook up with a random guy on Grindr. Even though I have been seeing a shrink for the past year and a half, he isn't much help.

I think it's important to all of the bros my age (~18) to just know the aftermath of this.

Basically, I ended up uninstalling grindr and I stopped talking with the guy I was with. It wasn't because the meeting itself was a bad experience, but more because after a month of thinking, along with a bunch of other big life events happening, I realized that I was way to frickin horny for my own good. Even more than that, I was really naive about what it meant to be with someone for the first time, no matter how far you go. 

And I didn't realize that immediately. It's not really until maybe about a week later that I started to feel uncomfortable thinking back to what I had done, not because I was repulsed/regretful, but because I had no idea how this new idea of sex fit in to my mental framework. Taking chemistry tests is really weird when suddenly the image of a 40-year-old dick pops into your mind. The realization that I can order a blowjob that is ""2343 feet away"" when I should be doing my homework is a huge change, and frankly I wasn't ready to deal with that sort of shift. The cognitive dissonance was definitely not something I wanted to have to deal with.

I've come out more knowledgeable about what my beliefs should be and how I should go about applying them (which is why I uninstalled grindr). I know hindsight is 20/20, and hornyness screws up mental processes, but at the time I should've recognized that this was too quick of a transition, and that it would have been better had my mental health been more solid.

**TL;DR**: I lucked out when I made the the decision to meet with someone on grindr when I had no previous sexual experience. The experience was overall good, but in hindsight, it was so rushed and so different from what I'm used to that it caused a lot of stress in the few weeks afterwards. I don't totally regret it, and I now have a better understanding of what I need to do to make sure I'm happy with myself, but it was definitely a weird episode that I'm not going to repeat.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So about a month ago I had a little episode that I asked about here on r/askgaybros: &lt;a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/2xogw9/18_year_old_home_alone_downloaded_grindr_now_im/""&gt;Original Post&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/2xpbh8/update_18_year_old_home_alone_downloaded_grindr/""&gt;Update #1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I'm almost 31 and have had one boyfriend that lasted about six months. Well last November I met a guy who I can not say enough positive things about. He's tall, beautiful, nice, essentially everything I want in a guy. We met on grindr and he was very clear that he just wanted to hookup. Fine by me, I mean I want more in life but at the time a regular hookup was good enough for me. 

Well we started hooking up, and then talking daily and hanging out. And then we started just talking daily and hanging out a few times a week. In mid January I got hammered and texted him and told him that I really liked him and that whether or not this goes into a relationship that I was truly thankful that I met him. 

That kind of freaked him out and he wanted to take a break. So we did for a few weeks, but then we took a trip to a comedy show that we had planned and had a great time. We've hooked up a few times since then too but nowhere near as often as before. 

So all seems to be going well until a few weeks ago when he essentially doesn't talk to me unless I initiate it. Before he would call me on his way home from work and we'd talk during his drive. I loved this and took it that things were going well. But then it stopped out of nowhere. 

Last night I was at his house and I'm leaving and we hug like always and I go to kiss him (like I did the last time we hung out) and he turns away. Ok. Red flag. So we sit and talk. 

He's not ready for a relationship. Still. He says that he likes me a lot as a friend but can't promise anything more than that for now. He doesn't wanna hookup, kiss, cuddle. Just wants to be friends. I tell him that I like him a lot but I see us as more than friends. We do a lot of things that just normal friends don't do and he agreed with me. 

I tell him that my end goal for us is to be in a relationship. He says he can't promise it but there's a chance it could happen, but he needs time. 

There's a lot more to this already long story but I'm just not sure what to do. I like this guy that I've known for four months more than anyone else I've ever known. He's special to me and means a whole lot to me. I don't wanna be just friends forever, but I don't want to lose him either. I want to give it a shot but it sucks because it's not when I'm ready. 

Should I just be friends with him? Should I completely distance myself? Should I look elsewhere (I've tried this and the guys in my area are horrible)? Or should I give him some space, let him take his time to figure things and then hope that we end up in a relationship?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was hoping to get some outside perspective and just cathartically type out my situation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m almost 31 and have had one boyfriend that lasted about six months. Well last November I met a guy who I can not say enough positive things about. He&amp;#39;s tall, beautiful, nice, essentially everything I want in a guy. We met on grindr and he was very clear that he just wanted to hookup. Fine by me, I mean I want more in life but at the time a regular hookup was good enough for me. &lt;/p&gt;

We're both gay but really haven't been into each other sexually in any way shape or form beyond a month or two into our friendship. We both work at the same graphic design firm and everything, about as tight as can be. 

Well, for the last eight months hes been in a relationship. It all seemed well and I was really happy for him. He had moved into his BFs apartment temporarily because his lease was up and he was still in the process of moving into a nicer apartment closer to the center of the city. He invited me over one day to have a few drinks. I assumed his BF was there but when I got there and asked where he was he said he was gone visiting family. A wedding for a cousin or uncle or something. 

So we carried on and had a bottle each. Well, I suggested we start prank calling people on the LAN line phone. We both carried on and called random numbers and said all of this terrible stuff to random people like telling them their mom or son or husband died. It was really hit or miss, but just terribly insensitive overall. Then I got an idea and started calling sex chat lines, I thought it was only like $3 a minute. We carried on and called some straight ones and carried on with the girls there pretending we were straight and stuff then said crap like ""I'm on the toilet wishing it was your mouth."" Just overall a stupid night filled with stupid decisions.

Well, come next Thursday morning (the night we got drunk was a Saturday) my friend calls me sobbing saying that he had been having troubles with his BF and they broke up over the night and he would be taking the off work that day. I asked if it had to do with the shit we did on his BFs phone and he kind of skirted around it. I didn't think too much of that specific event beyond that, assumed it was beyond us and he paid for it or something.

Friday about two weeks later we go to the mall to look at food mixers because I was on the market for one and he's an avid cook and wanted to get out because he was still getting over the breakup. Well, walking through the mall I hear someone behind me go 

""Fucking inconsiderate cunts. Having fun calling sex lines on other people's phone numbers!?"" 

I turn around and it's his BF walking towards us IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MALL as if nobody else is there. He's about ten feet away from my friend and red as a beet so I get between them (it was probably a dumb idea considering they're both *quite* a bit bigger than my scrawny self) and shove him backwards away from my friend. At this point a few of the people around us are hurrying to get out of the way and I hear some yelling from one of the employees in the store we're by. He stumbles a little then he lunges forward and decks me across the chin and I trip backwards and hit my head against a bench and lose consciousness. 

I wake up and I'm outside the mall beside an ambulance and there's an EMT standing over me, and I notice two police cars beside the curb with my friend and his ex in the back of both of them. The police ask me some questions and apparently my friend had beat the shit out of his ex. Well, a few days later my friend calls and apologizes to me and he tells me he's facing charges for assault and disturbing the peace and all this crap (I assume his ex is too?) and his ex is pursuing legal actions because we racketed a ~$400 phone bill. We talk a little and I learn that he actually chipped two of his BFs teeth, knocked one tooth out, and split his brow open and apparently blood just pissed out of his head. I told him how grateful I was to have him as a friend and stuff and just got really emotional.

Please help, I feel terrible and have no idea what to do or how to make this up to him. I would offer my friend money to give his ex but I don't have any. I don't know how to help my friend or if I could become involved in the legal drama and I'm absolutely panicked! I feel like I caused all of this.

The guys I like are the American boy next door look. Tall toned educated cute and sexy. However the thing they usually approach me, thinking I am a top.

TL;DR at the bottom though

So, when I posted last I said I was just so done with them gay hookup apps and hook ups in general, and didn't wanna meet guys that way...etc. However, aside apps, I a complete noob at picking up people in public (at least while sober) so this is kinda my story (on a random note, I've been off all the apps for about 2 weeks or so, and kinda glad I am off them, wasted WAY too much time looking for people to talk to...but anyway I digress lol)

This just happened about an hour ago. I had lunch at a gourmet burger place. I saw this guy looking at the menu overhead when I went to get a refill in the middle of my meal. Checked him out, I thought he was cute (tall, somewhat slim, fair skin, blue eyes, slightly hipstery-nerd lookin', he was my type lol) but I didn't act on it, and I just went back to eating. I was finishing up my meal and was getting up to throw away my tray. When I stood up, I noticed homeboy was sitting down behind me and waiting for his food pager to go off. 

Now I tell myself, when it comes to approaching strangers, I'm totally awkward...but truth is, I'm not a completely lost-cause social-retard. I'm actually beyond capable of holding up an insightful conversation if I have a topic of substance as an opener. This was the case with him, I saw he had a DSLR camera, and I am a hobby (and semi-professional) photographer. I had my opener, and I approached him and asked about the model he had and specs and how I was looking to upgrade cameras and so on. 

Now, I'm bi and unless a person is a stereotypical gay guy or speaks very feminine or whatever, I have 0% gaydar lol. So I really wasn't sure if this guy was gay or not. He went on to tell me he wasn't a professional photographer, he's a hobbyist. He was in actually town for a couple of weeks for rehearsal, he works on a cruise as an entertainer (either singer or dancer, I cant remember) This led me to think he could very well be gay. 

Right after he said that, his pager went off letting him know his food is ready, so we gave each other a quick goodbye, and parted ways, he got his food and I went to throw away my tray. After, I figured I should at least introduce myself, we had a friendly conversation as strangers, but we didn't know each others names. 

So I went upto him, introduced myself, he gave me his name and I gave him one of these business stickers I carry (I need to restock my wallet with business cards, but I had this stickers that have my logo and website on it) He said he would reciprocate, but his business cards are in the mail, but he would look me up later. I said it was no problem at all. After that, I said nice to meet you and goodbye and got in my car and left. Ball's in his court now.

Here's my wuss part. Obviously I thought this guys was cute, and we share an interest for photography. I kinda wanted to ask for his number, but again I wasn't 100% sure if he was gay, so I didn't wanna make an ass of myself by assuming.

When I sat back an analyzed the situation, I thought maybe I shoulda been more upfront about it. Is it too upfront to ask a stranger ""Are you gay by any chance?""? and if it is, would it be appropriate to ask for his number? Any tips you guys could give that I could use to not be such a wuss in public? 

**TL;DR saw an attractive guy while I was at lunch, noticed he had a camera (I'm into photography and striked up a convo about cameras) wasn't sure if he was gay, too embarrassed to ask, gave him my card....so the ball is in his court**
