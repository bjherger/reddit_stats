My boyfriend of 6 months (i'm 21, he just turned 28) has the same issue, but the opposite reaction. He hides it. I've been open with my number, and when I'd ask him, always very casually he'd shrug it off with a 'I really don't know', which isn't really a good sign to me.
He has never been open about his sexual history, when we were friends before he'd talk about crushes and sometimes certain experiences but usually only if related to anything emotional rather just a hot hook up.

At a party a couple weeks back after some drinks, in a group conversation a friend asked and he came out with a ""gah..about 70 I guess"". that stung because after all the times I threw it out there, he just decides to blurt it out like that, and in a group.


As I said, he is never really open about his sexual history. He is a pretty popular member of the art/fashion community where I live (I moved here only about 8 months ago), and he hangs around big names. He has slept with a lot of them, and weird situations have come up. Like parties where i'd get stared down and cold shouldered by ex FBs, general preying on him, long conversations and then when id ask what was that, he shrugs it off with again ""I really don't know"" when drunk, or different situations he'd later just tell me he'd fucked them before (this without me prompting anything).

I'm his first boyfriend, he was a real late bloomer....like a real late bloomer. So I mostly attribute this behavior to that.

I guess I don't really have a question on how I should react to all of this because for now I've mostly been just observing, but after 6 months im starting to get a pattern. 
I really was just trying to see if any other bros had any similar experiences, on both sides. 


TL;DR My boyfriend avoids talking about sexual history whenever it comes up, yet it is a long a list. Just generally confused over various situations.

Sadly, somewhere around the midpoint right up to graduation, we had a really big falling out and we have been mortal enemies since.

Thing is, one I chanced upon his FB profile picture and realized that the photo was of him at a local gay gathering event!

I've always sort of suspected that he was gay because of how 90210-ish and beverly hills-ish and bitchy he could be, if you get my drift. Closer to graduation, I finally shrugged it off completely because I felt was stereotyping too much: always surrounded by girls, never dated a girl openly (as far as I know) and basically acted quite feminine (limp wrist, laughing etc).

Then tonight. Tonight, I was scrolling through Grindr and guess what? I spotted his face! I couldn't believe my eyes. I tried restarting the app and refreshing, hoping he would go away. Well guys, this is the ultimate proof. It can't get any gayer than this.

Right now, I don't know how to feel or what I'm feeling. I feel scared and excited at the same time.

I'm scared of what might happen if he finds my profile too? But my profile name is super generic and nowhere close to my real name and there're no pictures of my face (on request only).

I'm excited because since we were 16, I've always suspected but never confirmed it. And now that life has brought him to me in fast forward mode, I'm not sure whether I should text him to tell him. Don't forget we ended our friendship and graduated on bad terms. But guys, we have something in common now!

It's been great because it hasn't been too serious and it's just felt RIGHT. We've been on two dates. The first one, I slept over at his place and it was just the right level of cuddling, kissing, and oral. And then this past weekend he slept over at my place. Upped the level of intensity in the bedroom a little bit, but there's still so much more room to explore with the relationship (in and out of the bedroom).  

So, I was thinking about what to do for our third date when I realized that this weekend was fucking VALENTINE'S DAY. Since it's been going great and we've been very forward with each other, I straight up just asked him if he wanted to spend Valentine's Day with me. And he said yes! And I immediately felt elated, until I realized that it may have just gotten super serious without either of us really wanting it to. 

So now, I'm wondering how to go about this. Because like I actually have no idea how serious this is getting. Could he be seeing other people? It would be totally understandable if he is, we've only been on two dates. I'm not seeing anyone else currently, but that's just because I dropped a couple hookups all at once because they were going NO. FUCKING. WHERE. Am I just stupid and reading too much into this dumb ass holiday? It's obvious that I need to talk to him about it soon. Really, I think that he could be my boyfriend some time soon, but I have no idea if he even wants that. How do I approach this without fucking shit up? ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok so for the past two weekends, I&amp;#39;ve been seeing this amazing guy. It&amp;#39;s been great because it hasn&amp;#39;t been too serious and it&amp;#39;s just felt RIGHT. We&amp;#39;ve been on two dates. The first one, I slept over at his place and it was just the right level of cuddling, kissing, and oral. And then this past weekend he slept over at my place. Upped the level of intensity in the bedroom a little bit, but there&amp;#39;s still so much more room to explore with the relationship (in and out of the bedroom).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I was thinking about what to do for our third date when I realized that this weekend was fucking VALENTINE&amp;#39;S DAY. Since it&amp;#39;s been going great and we&amp;#39;ve been very forward with each other, I straight up just asked him if he wanted to spend Valentine&amp;#39;s Day with me. And he said yes!

Alright so when someone breaks my heart, like my ex, instead of going through the chore of ""trying to be friendly"", I just cut tie entirely. That has always been how I handled things. Ever since he left me, I've been trying very very hard to move on (first relationship yet second heartbreak in a row), from seeing a therapist every week to moving out to a new city for school opportunities.

Cutting tie also include blocking on Facebook/Skype/mail... And while I've gotten better at handling his appearance from time to time on my news feed on Facebook (because we have tons of mutual friends), lately it's been quite harder.

My ex is studying literature. Therefore he's in tons of writing/poetry group, with our mutual friends. And one of this group is building a project involving sexual expression, eroticism and self discovery. This group is using a Facebook **page** and most of the picture includes my ex in underwear/tight shirt/shirtless... And that's beyond my capacity.

I've searched everywhere and I can't seem to block the page... And the fact we have mutual friends on the picture make them appears on my news feed. It's a nightmare, it seems like even if I move miles away my past follows me and haunt me. :(

Help please. Thank you.

**TL;DR**: Blocked my ex after the breakup. Unfortunately, he's a member of an erotic creative writing group which has a Facebook pages I can't block... And it means I have to deal with shirtless/underwear pictures of him and I don't want that. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greetings.&lt;/p&gt;

Not consciously, mind you, it's not like I go around with a list of requirements: must have a waist-to-chest ratio less than .7, bench/squat/deadlift of at least 200lbs (although that does impress me), etc; but it takes a hell of a lot to get my id going. 

I've been working out for a little over a year, first as a means to treat my depression and migraines, and then just because I fell in love with it. A month ago I started the 5-3-1 powerlifting training program and have already been gaining considerable strength. On top of that, three weeks ago I started intermittent fasting, and I've already lost an inch off my waist and gone down three percent in body fat to a respectable 12%. Also I've taken my yoga practice, which had been haphazard before at best, to a daily session, which really helps combat the hunger pangs. 

Now my problem: I used to go to the gym and relish in the eye-candy. All the guys are straight, or so deep in the closet they're just as good as, as I go to a southern university. I'd always find someone I found attractive and have a whole set of conflicted emotions spanning from jealousy to lust. Nowadays, I don't really have that. Sure I still feel jealous whenever a guy lifts more than me, but now I don't have any of the lust to go with it. Straight guys have become utterly unappealing. While this may sound good--I'm becoming more confident and therefore no longer just wanting what I can't have because I can't have it--I'm also equally repulsed, or at least unimpressed, by gay men. Even porn stars have become lackluster. I watch porn and all I see is uneven deltoids, bad skin and small quads. It's as though the happier I am with my own appearance the shittier everyone else looks.
I don't think that I'm asexual, although I've struggled with that particular identity for some time. I've had sex with six different guys and never enjoyed myself--I have a problem with sexual anhedonia, which basically means I don't feel pleasure from orgasms.

Has anyone else ever had difficulty being attracted to other guys? I'm 21, so most of my gay friends are sex fiends and can't fathom not enjoying sex or being so damn picky. I was so desperate last year, and at the urging of one of my friends that I needed to lose my virginity, that I dated a guy who I was never attracted to but thought was nice who turned out to be a real crazy turd. Should I keep this diet up if I'm already at a healthy weight and am only wanting to get abs to rub it in the faces of everyone who thought I was fat in high school and attract guys who it now seems I won't be attracted to in return? Should I just hold out however I can until I go to grad school in a big city where there are more gay men, and therefore a higher probability of me finding someone to be attracted to? Or should I try to work on my fault-finding tendencies, and if so, how? 

In short: Dieting and exercise makes me less self-critical and more critical of others, which is killing my sex drive but not my horniness.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;ve always been pretty picky with guys.

So let me preface as to why I need your advice! I'm 19 and I have an inkling that I am bisexual. I've done everything with girl and loved it, but now I want to try something out with a guy. Here's my problem, whenever I see a guy in public it is nearly impossible to imagine myself kissing, giving oral, fondling, etc. to him. But when I picture getting and/or giving a blow job, giving and/or receiving, rim job, etc. from someone I've never seen or met it makes me rock hard. So with that being said what would be the best way to explore this new sexual development for me? Website? App? Going somewhere in my state?

I've downloaded Grindr and read some of the descriptions. Mine would be something like this, ""Hey just a guy who is curious to explore his sexuality and not really looking for a relationship. I want to spend some time with someone who would be interested in going slow with me in the bedroom."" So basically I want to find someone that would take it easy with me and let me try out things on him and vice versa. I give head, then he gives me head and so on. Allowing me to fully explore the sexual side of being with a man. Anyways, I need your advice as to what would be the best route in exploring this new found discovery of mine!

2.  I'm not very fit due to a semester I spent being depressed and not working out. 
3.  I don't know much about rugby and the new guys on the team this semester are already pretty comfortable playing because they've all played several sports before. So I'm already behind.

So I've been recently hitting the gym a lot more lately in an effort to end my sedentary high metabolism lifestyle and I keep seeing this sexy muscle stud working out. He's 5'10, brown hair military cut-ish and muscled up.
Throughout our workouts we make eye contact a lot..when we pass each other mostly. Me being insecure about my smaller frame and, quickly glance away. My body type can be described as...disgusting...lol jk. toning up a skinny fat body basically with a marginally attractive face. I'd give my overall appearance a 6.5. the .5 is for my personality(just in case you were wondering).

So, I work at a restaurant(breakfast type) right down the street from the gym and he, in an act of fate, sat in my section. I joked around with him and he left(leaving only $1.87 tip which I was more upset about seeing as I made him laugh :/ ...but I digress)

He came in the other day and sat in another person's section and I swear he was waiting for me to look at him as I finished talking to my table passing him by. I did and I smiled and nodded and went on my way because I couldn't at the time think of anything to say to him.

I again saw him at the gym today when I walked in and turned he was looking at me but I didn't get the ""I want to bang him"" look just  more eye contact I guess. My problem is I don't know if it's just a coincidence or maybe he's interested.

 I live in the south and we're all closeted here. There's practically no gay scene where I live. I'm also not the type of person, when it comes to flirting or dating, to make the first interaction. Not sure what to do...help?

I hope you're fine.

I'm 22 and, in the last few mouths, my life as been a freak show. I found out I was gay about six/seven mouths when I fall in love with a friend of mine. In the begining was too complicated to deal with the feelings and I need to see a psychologist. I never told my friend about this and I just stop talking and avoid him in order to forget him. The feelings went down but only disappear when I met another guy (3 years older), in the begging of this year. (There are few guys around my age who I feel phisical attracted). 

Lucky me, this one is gay and we start knowing each other, by texting and talking on the phone. We leave in diferent cities (one hour by train) and we couldn't see each other every day. I spend the last weekend in his appartment and the things started to get more closed and end up in this bed. I never been with anyone before, so I was nervous but he was tottaly compreensive (actually, he was the first person I kissed.) I want to take the things slowly and, once both of us are fairly tops we decide to let anal sex for other day. So, we spend the night together - a lot of kissing, handjobs and body touching, fingers... (I think we came five or six times during the night. I was really horny, he's tottatly my tipe). 

So, best weekend I ever had but this feeling didn't take too much to end. Three days later, while we were talking on the phone, he told me that he couldn't be in a distante relationship and he couldn't botton. As long as I know, I prefer to be a top. I mean, every time I think in having sex with a man, I usualy see my self as a top. But I don't want this straight roles to be aplied in my relationships, that means that I don't belive in roles in bed. So, as long it doesn't hurt me, I do not have any problem with bottom, even if I don't take any pleasure. I do prefer a versatile relationship. 

But he does not see the things this way. He said he really liked me, but he didn't liked to bottom the last time he try with one of his ex-boyfriends. He also said that he need a more present relationship, and that the only the weenkends aren't enough. 

So, I back to my bedroom, feeling alone again. I guess that the odds aren't in my favor. If wasn't enough to be gay, only attracted to a certant kind of man, I have yet to find someone who's sexual compatible with me. Sometimes, life could make the things a bit less harder.

I just figured I'd ask fellow gay people since one thing I want is an okay gay community.

I live in Orlando, FL and am graduating college next year with a fairly typical liberal arts degree. I used to live in Miami, but the cost of living there is much too outrageous for a recent grad without a full time job yet. I love the environment though and want something similar to it but with something more realistic for young people.

One of my biggest concerns is weather. I want to move to the Southwest and have been looking at places like New Mexico, Nevada, Texas and Arizona. California would be awesome, but everyone and their mother wants to live in California and it just doesn't seem like a feasible option at this point. Growing up in Florida all my life, I need it to be hot year round. The desert appeals to me because it's always hot but without the steam room-like humidity that is present in Florida.

Another thing is cost of living. Having lived in Miami, my idea of cost of living may be a bit more liberal than others. After moving off campus, I rented a small (600 sq ft) one bedroom apartment in a decent neighborhood close to school for $1100 excluding utilities. I managed to afford this with a combination of two jobs and some help from my Mom. My Mom has agreed to pay 25% of my rent when I move out for the first year, so that should help.

I want to live in a fairly large city (think Phoenix, Las Vegas, Albuquerque, San Diego) but would prefer the cost of living to be not quite as high as Miami's. I would probably rent for a year or two and try to buy a house as soon as I got a decent salary in order to start building equity. I'm not certain what the housing markets are like in these areas so some input would be nice.

I'm a young, single gay man, so an accepting environment would be nice. Miami and Orlando both have quite large gay communities with fun nightlife options and I'd like to not have to part with that. I'm not a huge rager but like to have fun on the weekends after all my work is done. I'm thinking New Mexico and Texas are more conservative, but I shouldn't have a problem having fun and finding men, right?

A nice job market is also something I need to look for. I'm realistic in that my degree isn't for anything specific, but moving to an area with a depressed job market won't do me any favors. I have internships under my belt, but I'm not sure if I want to look for jobs here in Orlando and get tied down here, or look for jobs in the Southwest and cross my fingers that they'd be willing to relocate a 22-year-old with no ""big boy job"" experience. I have quite a bit of money saved up from living at home and working for so long (think ~$12000) but obviously don't want to move out without any sort of plan.

I have a car so public transportation isn't a factor I need to worry about. But cheap (ish) gas would be nice. For reference, the current cost of gas in Orlando is now about $2.15. I'm not sure if that's considered cheap in relation to the rest of the country, but I know it's more expensive down South ($2.35 in Miami).

I haven't ruled out moving abroad, but I'd probably save that for when I'm older and more established. FWIW, if I did leave the country, I'd like to go somewhere like Australia, Spain, Italy, or the Middle East (hot climates with good economies; I also speak Arabic and Spanish).

Sorry for the ramble and if it's an overdone topic. I wasn't sure where to post this, and I know this forum has people from all over the world, so bear with me or please point me in the right direction.

I love the environment though and want something similar to it but with something more realistic for young people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my biggest concerns is weather. I want to move to the Southwest and have been looking at places like New Mexico, Nevada, Texas and Arizona. California would be awesome, but everyone and their mother wants to live in California and it just doesn&amp;#39;t seem like a feasible option at this point. Growing up in Florida all my life, I need it to be hot year round. The desert appeals to me because it&amp;#39;s always hot but without the steam room-like humidity that is present in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing is cost of living. Having lived in Miami, my idea of cost of living may be a bit more liberal than others. After moving off campus, I rented a small (600 sq ft) one bedroom apartment in a decent neighborhood close to school for $1100 excluding utilities. I managed to afford this with a combination of two jobs and some help from my Mom. My Mom has agreed to pay 25% of my rent when I move out for the first year, so that should help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to live in a fairly large city (think Phoenix, Las Vegas, Albuquerque, San Diego) but would prefer the cost of living to be not quite as high as Miami&amp;#39;s. I would probably rent for a year or two and try to buy a house as soon as I got a decent salary in order to start building equity. I&amp;#39;m not certain what the housing markets are like in these areas so some input would be nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a young, single gay man, so an accepting environment would be nice. Miami and Orlando both have quite large gay communities with fun nightlife options and I&amp;#39;d like to not have to part with that. I&amp;#39;m not a huge rager but like to have fun on the weekends after all my work is done. I&amp;#39;m thinking New Mexico and Texas are more conservative, but I shouldn&amp;#39;t have a problem having fun and finding men, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nice job market is also something I need to look for. I&amp;#39;m realistic in that my degree isn&amp;#39;t for anything specific, but moving to an area with a depressed job market won&amp;#39;t do me any favors. I have internships under my belt, but I&amp;#39;m not sure if I want to look for jobs here in Orlando and get tied down here, or look for jobs in the Southwest and cross my fingers that they&amp;#39;d be willing to relocate a 22-year-old with no &amp;quot;big boy job&amp;quot; experience. I have quite a bit of money saved up from living at home and working for so long (think ~$12000) but obviously don&amp;#39;t want to move out without any sort of plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a car so public transportation isn&amp;#39;t a factor I need to worry about. But cheap (ish) gas would be nice. For reference, the current cost of gas in Orlando is now about $2.15. I&amp;#39;m not sure if that&amp;#39;s considered cheap in relation to the rest of the country, but I know it&amp;#39;s more expensive down South ($2.35 in Miami).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t ruled out moving abroad, but I&amp;#39;d probably save that for when I&amp;#39;m older and more established. FWIW, if I did leave the country, I&amp;#39;d like to go somewhere like Australia, Spain, Italy, or the Middle East (hot climates with good economies; I also speak Arabic and Spanish).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the ramble and if it&amp;#39;s an overdone topic. I wasn&amp;#39;t sure where to post this, and I know this forum has people from all over the world, so bear with me or please point me in the right direction. &lt;/p&gt;
