Them: ""Hey""

Me: ""Hi, how are you today?""

For the past few weeks, I've been exploring this subreddit trying to find answers. Confusion has gotten the best of me, and I've had quite enough of this feeling. It has taken me years to admit this, but tonight I can finally say I am questioning my sexuality. 

Life has been pretty good to me. I've always done well academically, maintained a group of close friends, got involved, you know... pretty much what everyone posts. At least, that's how I seem to others. For the past 6 years, I have lived with this feeling that I'm not living to my full potential. It feels like I've been on a roller coaster that will never stop. I describe it as fear, embarrassment, and sadness. There's so much I want to say, but I can't spend all night writing a novel because The Winds of Winter would probably be out before I finished. So yeah, here's the quick version. 

I like to say that this began happening around the age of 11-12. Middle school started, my elementary school friends met new people, and the discovery of girls was a hit. My social circle pretty much struck a wall at this point. I was awkward, quiet, and just trying to fit in. When my ""friends"" started noticing girls, I felt that I had to follow along. I never really saw too much special. They were my friends, but I always felt so weird when they started talking about them in the pseudo-sexual manner that preteens do. I tried so hard, and even now it still feels the same. People started noticing though. I mean, if you don't have a girlfriend at 12, then there must be a problem. Anyways, I did have one ""girlfriend"" and I'd sometimes wait for her bus to pick her up. I remember one of the older kids looking at me with a smirk and say ""Wow you must be gay"". I know. A boy having a girlfriend? That's definitely a homosexual tendency. But the words still hurt. I remember running home crying and just locking myself in my room for awhile until I settled myself down. This continued for a few years, but I got use to it. Eventually, the girl lost interest and dated a plethora of guys, but today she is my best friend. This kind of torment was not only experienced during school hours or even by my peers. I've experienced it from my family, too. My sister and I are about the same age, but she can be mean, manipulating, and a tormenter. My most vivid memory of us is her running through a Staple's computer section and typing ""One_Time_Deal_ is so gay"" and other obscenities. I laughed and cried all at the same time. My own sister felt the need to embarrass me in public like that, and I had no way to stop it. I don't even know why I laughed, but it was my only coping mechanism. My parents never even punished her. To this day, I am so scared to go into an electronic's store with her because she is still willing to do it. Got to love family. 

Anyways, flash forward to high school. Getting great grades and my social circle had rekindled. I've had so many opportunities to have girlfriends, but nothing worked out. I always felt too awkward because I still don't have my licence, my own car, and I am a terrible one-on-one type of person. To stop the excuses though, I always got scared. I never felt right being with a girl. There just always felt like something was stopping me. Some people talk about that ""spark"" that they feel, and I've never experience it. As I type this, I feel like you all might think I just need to throw myself out there and get over the bullying and the fear, but it's more than that. I try thinking about girls, but I feel like I'm missing something. Guys though... I just don't know... I get this feeling in my stomach and I can feel my pulse quickening and I get scared even then, too. I can't seem to open myself up to anyone because I am scared to be ridiculed and forgotten. 

Now, as the end of summer approaches, I feel stuck. University is just around the corner, and I know I can be myself. I'm talking to this girl right now, and she's great and all, but there's really nothing going on. I think my biggest fear is that if I admit that I'm gay, the people who've believed that I've been straight will criticize my decision and apply me to some stereotype. I just want to be happy with who I am. I don't want to get emotionally attached to someone without that sexual attachment there as well. Hurting people is not my thing. I actually want to feel some satisfaction with myself at the end of the day, and not how I feel now. There must be some balance... Just some way to figure out myself. I don't want who I'm attracted to to be my defining characteristic. At the end of the day, I just want to be me. 

So, after that lengthy read, my question to all of you kind and experienced people is what next? Does this relate to any of you? What should I do to learn more about myself? I don't want to admit something to my friends and family if it turns out to be wrong. I just want to know what I can do to feel like my old self again.

Over the summer, I've been cooped in my home trying to figure out what I want to do with the rest of my life. Unfortunately, I didn't do as hot as I wanted because of some pretty heavy issues with chronic depression in my sophomore and junior year.

Some background: I'm a senior completing his degree at UC Berkeley with a 3.0 GPA by the end of December. My intention was to go to law school, but with the shit legal market nowadays, I backed away from that and considered other options. I'm currently doing an internship at this sell-side developing market research firm, and I've seriously been considering a career in finance. I've been mulling over getting some certifications and finding some work in the business/finance (either a Certified Financial Analyst or Certified Public Accountant). Moving out of the Bay Area is a last resort because of my family ties here (parents and little sister).

The stress of making a decision has been seriously getting to me, and in my medically-induced seclusion, I haven't been able to move around as much as I want. I've been trying to tell myself it's OK, everything will be OK, I just need to wait to gain my perspective, but people that have graduated the same year as me already have internships or full-time positions lined up for them.

I'm at a loss, and there really aren't that many people I can talk to. If anybody could help or lend some helpful advice, I would love you forever for it (even though I can't see your faces).

A little bit of background: I'm a mostly closeted gay guy who has been involved with a Bible study in a young professionals group for several years now. It's a moderate church within a conservative denomination. Most of the people are young engaged or married couples, although there are a few single people as well. There are a wide range of viewpoints about homosexuality in this group. Most conversations I have heard have been supportive. A few people hold more traditional views, but anybody who is leery of homosexuality has been very careful with their words and even if they think it is sinful, they think that we're all sinners who should not judge others. As long as they're respectful, I'm not going to have a problem with it or feel uncomfortable. The two people I've told there were supportive.

Anyway, a lot of these young couples are starting families, so the remaining members have been trying to recruit more people. It's been slow, but we've added a few people. Last week, we had a smaller group than usual, and one of the new guys brought up homosexuality out of thin air. He remarked that ""we need to warn those who are engaged in the homosexual lifestyle that they need to turn from their ways or they will go to hell."" I was stunned. He said this like this was what he expected everybody's viewpoint to be. None of the rest of us said anything directly in response. I don't know whether there were others that agreed with him, although I got a sense that they didn't take it that far. One of the people I came out to was there and seemed irritated by his statement.

Anyway, that evening, I posted on my Facebook as a note for those who think that gays are going to hell that regardless of your position on homosexuality, that we're all sinners and we should all be going to hell if it weren't for Jesus. There were seven people that I know went to that church - and four that currently go there, including the people that I told, that liked my status.

So I'm not entirely sure what to do. This guy being at events has made me feel uncomfortable. I don't think it's right to turn people away, but honestly, I have the feeling that most people would side with me. I suppose I could come out to a bunch more, but that could get messy as well. I'm not going to turn away from Christianity, and I really don't think it's fair to leave the church that I'm going to based on the views of one newcomer. But I know that this guy is going to be there this week, and I really don't want to go.

I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s right to turn people away, but honestly, I have the feeling that most people would side with me. I suppose I could come out to a bunch more, but that could get messy as well. I&amp;#39;m not going to turn away from Christianity, and I really don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s fair to leave the church that I&amp;#39;m going to based on the views of one newcomer. But I know that this guy is going to be there this week, and I really don&amp;#39;t want to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;
