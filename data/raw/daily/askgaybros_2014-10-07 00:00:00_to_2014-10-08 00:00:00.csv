He wouldn't prescribe PreP himself. He's referring me to an infectious disease specialist. Which of course means that I have to share personal sexual info with yet another medical professional, which is always delightful (\sarcasm).

So, when I say I like boobs, I don't mean the ""they're fun to play with"" way, nor do I mean I long for sexual interaction with them. What I mean is when naked boobs show up on the TV or computer screen  (or even revealing cleavage) I always look, and  sometimes I like them in the ""I would put my face or dick in them"" kinda way. 

I have 0 interest in the kitty kat. Like ick. But sometimes I find boobs attractive. Probably not that weird I'm guessing. Just makes me a Kinsey 4 or 5 instead of full blown 6. I'm okay with that. 

But here's where I need the advice: My boyfriend and I have been together over 5 years, and I've never actually said anything to him about it. Should I? 

Like he knows that boobs don't gross me out, and he feels the same way. But I've never told him that I actually like them. Is it something that he needs to know? 

I ask because I'm not sure it really has any bearing on our relationship. I don't long for contact with boobs, I don't actively pursue them, I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything by being with another male exclusively, nor do  I have any interest in being with a woman or bringing one home. 

But something keeps telling me that I should tell him that sometimes, when I see them, I like them, even though it probably doesn't matter. We've discussed it to the extent of neither of us are grossed out by them, or that ""tits are cool."" But that was it.

So what do you say gay bros? Does he need to know even though I have no desire to act on it?

I want to break up with my boyfriend of two weeks.

I met him on Grindr. We had lunch, I fell for him. He's very sweet and he's cute. Our chemistry matches. We agreed to be official hours later.

Pardon me if it is too fast. This is my first relationship (I am 26) and I was thrilled to feel like I was wanted. I've been on dates before and the attraction would always be one-sided (he likes me, I don't, or vice versa). This one now feels right.

Also I was a bit lonely so I gave in.

Everything happened so fast. We spent 12 hours in a motel. Now he calls me husband. We said I love you to each other after only 24 hours.

However, I now feel this is wrong. We're incredibly mismatched. He's 22, and young. A bit immature. Plays video games all the time. 

When we're together we talk only about his interests. If I talk about mine (politics, science, technology) he cuts me off subtly. 

He's also not so financially-independent. I'd say dumb? He earns only 1/3 of what I do and there are times when I pay for things like dinner. I even got him an extension on my phone plan (bill goes to his address so he pays for it). Bought him running shoes because he said his shoes were destroyed by the rains. He's also hinting that he wants a new office bag and a power bank (perhaps I'm only thinking that he's asking me to buy them, when he never did).

There's a strong inkling that he's using me but he looks offended when I bring it up. His excuse is that he has a group of friends that are much older and they always pay for him, and he got accustomed to it. He also said he's cute so people just give him stuff.

I... I like him, but I feel like the longer this lasts, the longer I'll be hurt. 

I texted him that we need a break yesterday. He called and was mad. It was I that cried and asked to reverse the situation. 

But after thinking about it, I still want to cut off ties with him. I can't shake off the feeling that we're mismatched, and that he may be using me. There are things I need to do too like getting the phone line back so my credit won't be hit if he refuses to pay for it. It's in my name after all.

This may take a few minutes to elicit legit responses, so for those of you that take the time, thank you so much.

Please see the information below, and if you have any background/input on how you really affected or changed a stubborn Christian family member's mind on accepting you for being gay, that's what I'm looking for. I can't get involved; it's not my battle, but to see how other people may have gotten through it would be helpful to decide on potential courses of action rather than just arguing.

**Background**: I'm in love with an awesome guy, and have been for about 9 months now. We both come from Christian homes, and my family has developed over the last two years since I came out to fully love and accept me for who I am. My boyfriend, on the other hand, has a mother that has a very different perspective about the coexistence of faith and homosexuality. Since he came out to her about 3 months ago, she's said things along the lines of ""i'm going to pray that guy (me) out of your life,"" and ""I know your faith will bring you back,"" and things of the like. Basically, she's not convinced it's permanent, and that he can be swayed into being straight. Trust me, he's gay.
So here's what just happened. I saw this article on here (thanks gaybros) and shared it with my family and my guy. He then shared it to his family, and asked to hear their thoughts.

http://johnpavlovitz.com/2014/09/17/if-i-have-gay-children-four-promises-from-a-christian-pastorparent/[1]

**TL:DR** - It's an article a pastor wrote about how he would treat his kids if they turned out gay. Very cool perspective and empowering for us gay men that still try to hold on to our Christian faith.

Here was his mom's response:

""As I read this article, I am bothered by the ""feel good"" undertones all throughout. Of course, as a parent you want what's best for your child and to be their biggest supporter. But I have to go back to Scripture. How will accepting of a child who claims to be homosexual line up with the Word of God?

I know every good and perfect gift comes from my Father in Heaven. So I know a child is not born homosexual but rather chooses to accept the temptations and lies of this world.
If we are a true believers in Christ, according to the Bible and the way of the life of Christ, we cannot separate our theology with our immorality. We can not ride the fence.
I know these are not things you want to hear. I love you. And I know the Holy Spirit will reveal Truth to you.

Trusting God At All Times, 
Mom""

It's clear to see how my boyfriend is so frustrated with his mom, and dealing with an agonizing battle of trying to love her but also try to show her that it's ok to just love him. 

Next, she sent this back as a rebuttal and asked for his feedback.
http://www.charismanews.com/opinion/45603-9-prophetic-keys-for-breaking-the-homosexual-spirit[2]

**TL:DR** - Crazy interpretation of scripture that calls gays a world dominating force that through unity will bring on the apocalypse.

Here was my boyfriend's response.

""As with any article, I consider the perspectives of the individual writing the paper. This one is a bit one-sided since it is coming from a conservative Christian magazine, which leaves out the roundedness necessary for good research. But that's aside the point.
We talked about the Tower of Babel yesterday in church, and the pastor mentioned exactly what the writer mentioned: namely, that the Lord uses language to divide and to unite, specifically with regards to the language of the Holy Spirit. I cannot argue the theology.

Now when we consider the spirit of the world that the author is writing about, we are talking about a spirit that desires power. Let's be realistic, the struggle between good and evil is, and always has been, one of politics and power. God is the supreme ruler of the universe, and Satan was cast out is his kingdom because he questioned that sovereignty and power. So we have two spirits vying for the souls of all the poeple on the earth: Jesus and Satan. When the author talks about the homosexual agenda, it reminds me of agendas that exist all across society, but they all strive for the same things: justice, fairness, harmony. The women's rights movements, black rights movements, movements to end child slavery, movements to end hunger, etc. I have a great respect for all these movements, otherwise you wouldn't have had the right to send me an email (me being male and you being a female) and I wouldn't have the ability to have a black friend without being considered a lower class citizen. None of these agendas and movements were attempting to seize power over the souls of the earth.

I don't see the homosexual agenda as a kingdom that is attempting to take over the world, but rather as a group within a larger society that wants the same rights as everyone else, in a state where we are allowed to enact justice (USA!). We aren't attempting to build up any kingdom to touch heaven, we aren't trying to show how high and mighty we can become. There are extremes in every group, and there are going to be those that are militant and zealous for their rights and beliefs. Should it be categorized as pride unquenchable? I certainly don't think so.

We owe it to ourselves and to everyone around us to take their perpectives holistically. With whatever lens we decide to view our world, we can't see everyone as against us; but rather, why not live peaceably and try to change the world with the light and love that God wants us to show ourselves and others? Why get caught up in the weeds when we can focus our attention on the ONE thing that truly matters: love. It's the only thing that will last, and we should love God and love each other.

Love, Your son""

But still, nothing changes. My boyfriend is intelligent, kind, and patient, but this has become a war of attrition over time and i'm looking for a new way to approach this. **Thank you so much for your help!**","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, I love this community and thank you all for your input and support over the years. This may take a few minutes to elicit legit responses, so for those of you that take the time, thank you so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please see the information below, and if you have any background/input on how you really affected or changed a stubborn Christian family member&amp;#39;s mind on accepting you for being gay, that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m looking for. I can&amp;#39;t get involved; it&amp;#39;s not my battle, but to see how other people may have gotten through it would be helpful to decide on potential courses of action rather than just arguing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background&lt;/strong&gt;: I&amp;#39;m in love with an awesome guy, and have been for about 9 months now. We both come from Christian homes, and my family has developed over the last two years since I came out to fully love and accept me for who I am. My boyfriend, on the other hand, has a mother that has a very different perspective about the coexistence of faith and homosexuality. Since he came out to her about 3 months ago, she&amp;#39;s said things along the lines of &amp;quot;i&amp;#39;m going to pray that guy (me) out of your life,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;I know your faith will bring you back,&amp;quot; and things of the like. Basically, she&amp;#39;s not convinced it&amp;#39;s permanent, and that he can be swayed into being straight. Trust me, he&amp;#39;s gay.
So here&amp;#39;s what just happened. I saw this article on here (thanks gaybros) and shared it with my family and my guy. He then shared it to his family, and asked to hear their thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""http://johnpavlovitz.com/2014/09/17/if-i-have-gay-children-four-promises-from-a-christian-pastorparent/%5B1%5D""&gt;http://johnpavlovitz.com/2014/09/17/if-i-have-gay-children-four-promises-from-a-christian-pastorparent/[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL:DR&lt;/strong&gt; - It&amp;#39;s an article a pastor wrote about how he would treat his kids if they turned out gay. Very cool perspective and empowering for us gay men that still try to hold on to our Christian faith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here was his mom&amp;#39;s response:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;As I read this article, I am bothered by the &amp;quot;feel good&amp;quot; undertones all throughout.

This is a throwaway account for reasons you will read below. I'm sorry if it gets too long, but I really don't know how to start dealing with this bump in a relationship I'm starting.  
  
I am HIV negative, and I fell in love with someone that is HIV positive.  
  
I met my man a couple of months ago. There were no expectations - it was just two friends meeting for the first time to hang out, because we are both new in town, and don't have many friends yet. The meeting was successful - it was like we've been best friends forever. We started hanging out more, and little by little, it sneaked up on us the fact that we were falling in love.  
  
Before anything serious happened, he told me that he had a secret to tell me, but he didn't want to hurt me, or didn't want me to disappear on him because of it. We played it by ear, but things did get serious, and he eventually confessed his secret to me, that he is HIV+, and I'm the only person that knows.
  
  
I myself don't have a problem dating someone HIV+. He has done all the right things - he was honest with me, and he quickly started treatment, and is undetectable. So I know I'm safer with him than with any stranger that claims to be negative.  
  
Before me, he was in a relationship for a decade with an abusive ex. He suffered a lot, and got cheated on. The problem is that he sees being HIV+ as a punishment. That he feels like he did something wrong, and that this is his punishment. He tells me he will give me all the love in the world, and will make me the happiest man, but he can't give me his body, because it is damaged. He is terrified of infecting me, or anyone else, that he hasn't had sex since 2011 when he learned about his status.  
  
I love this guy so much. I really do. He has been so amazing to me, and has treated me like a Prince. I want to help him, but I don't know how. I don't know how to make him understand that HIV is not a punishment, that I'm not scared or grossed out, and that I am 100% safe with him as long as he takes his treatment, and visits his doctor regularly.  
  
  
  
Thank you guys for letting me vent and reading this. Any help is tremendously appreciated. If he doesn't stay with me, I at least want to help him in case he meets someone else that loves him as much as I do.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone...&lt;/p&gt;

PS, the damned subject won't let me edit it.  I'm 46F, not 46M.  But since I attract so many gay men for some reason I may as well be.  But when bitches say they're gay men in a woman's body I kind of want to beat them with a lead pipe.  Okay, on to our dramatic story.

Guy, 26M, very into me, a tough, cigar-smoking 46F that according to both genders looks 30.  I'm gayfriendly but also gaysavvy.  I think he's young, gay and closeted and just looking for a beard to help him come out whilst also providing money and a sweet pad during same.  Not interested in that.  Occasional peen is pretty good and this bitch ain't never giving it up to a woman, ever.  Trust me.  So I'm curious a what the majestic /r/gaybros consensus will think of this fella.  Pls confirm my suspicions: closeted or ???

How he seemeth straight/nerd/???

- Has many gay male gamer buddies but has yet to sleep with any

- Plays deliberately obtuse when said buddies come onto him, and deflects their interest and comeons as if he never heard them

- Checks me and my ass and boobs out at every opportunity

- Checks women of my race out at every op, too, so long as they are thin and well kept as I am

- Jealous as *hell* should any other male give me even a glance and he sees it, much less the time of day

- Acts genuinely depressed should I mention anyone else I'm dating

- Dirty ass apartment.  Just unspeakable.  Horrible.  Beyond Straight Male.  40 yards past caveman.  You would die of burns there

- Zero fashion sense whatsoever

- Claims female ex but not one human in our circle has ever met or seen this rare winged supernatural being

- On Facebook, claims he is ""into women""

- Cannot keep his eyes out of mine (I am female), cannot keeps his damned hands off me, has tried to smooch me many times

- Blushes if I give him a direct stare

- The back of his neck and how he walks.  I can't describe the importance of each but you know exactly what I'm talking about.  He exhibits both.


And now how he seemeth gay as ever:

- Has many gay male gamer buddies and not one straight one not anywhere.  In a world of straight male gamer buddies he could friend.  Hashmark things that make you go hmmm

- Recoiled in horror the night I finally said, ok, quit the bs; I'll come to your apt and bang you, since you've asked numerous times  (but then said hours later, wait a minute, come by tomorrow during the day and I'll bang you then, during the daytime.)  Pass

- His ""interest"" in those women similar to me seems bogus as hell; something fake about it in big bold italic letters.  Similarly I think him checking out my ass and boobs is acting.  I think he's scared to come out and I've told him he needs to.  He replied ""I'm straight.  You don't know everything and you don't know me as well as you think you do.""  BullSHIT, bitch, I was in gay clubs before you were born and before it was a trend, back when it was dangerous, and I was not drinking and nuisancing my gay bros whilst there but instead drinking and waiting for my then girlfriends to get there, so you don't fool ANYBODY

- Into musical theatre, hates all other forms of music, telling me, ""I just love the 'journey' showtunes take you on'; have you ever heard a straight male say this?  That's right girls NEVER

- His Voice.  All the bells and whistles, ladies.  ALL the bells and whistles.

- His hands and mannerisms while talking.  All the bells and whistles, girls, plus a donut.  And this is a pink frosting jelly donut with sprinkles on top.

- If a stunningly beautiful woman is in the room with him, he folds his arms and steps back from her, eyeing her with faintly cold hostility.  He did this to a runway model friend of mine recently who I am hoping to bone.  (I am female, so is she.)  This makes me wonder since I'm considered hotness and straight males crawl all over me, WTF does this queen want from me?  Do I seem *that male?  Really?*  :(

- Fears sex, fears intimacy, refuses to smoke, refuses to smoke a J, even refuses alcohol, and claims he is ""religious"".

Please.

So, about me:

Rich.  Exotic.  Tall.  Awesome place, awesome career.  Manymany many straight men after me.  Bisexual but mostly lez.  Been to every club, scrubbed every glory hole, worked at every AIDS benefit organization as a volunteer, worn a strap on, seen it all.  Interested in 100% straight men for now.  Will never be into a 100% gay male as a partner.  Sorry, it's got zero bennies for women and this is not a charity.  

So: Cinderella Princess acts like he can't live more than a day without me but I have no interest in being the Barbara Valentin to his Freddie Mercury.  Frankly I have women and straight men to screw in my life and this would be a waste of time stepback that only benefits HIM.  He's all over me like he's my jedi apprentice and I'm over it.  He's maybe the eightieth young gay to do this to me in my lifetime and, I am flattered, but um... no.

Because free rent and counseling while coming out ain't free and all you girls know it.  Therefore what the fuck is with this guy?  I've read that sometimes Hardcore Nerd resembles The Gay, but my feeling is nope, this boy is Simply Gay and hoping to play rent boy while fucking around with other boys on the side or poaching from the straight fools I bring home, and you know, at near 50 that's just no.

I've been there and I know better, I see through it, I saw through it in 1986, and so there.

Oh yeah: he knows what a glory hole is.  At 26.  Yet claims he's straight.  Lawd have mercy.  Uh huh, you're straight; yeah right

Verdict?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Gaybros, I&amp;#39;ll make this brief.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guy, 26M, very into me, a tough, cigar-smoking 46F that according to both genders looks 30.  I&amp;#39;m gayfriendly but also gaysavvy.  I think he&amp;#39;s young, gay and closeted and just looking for a beard to help him come out whilst also providing money and a sweet pad during same.  Not interested in that.  Occasional peen is pretty good and this bitch ain&amp;#39;t never giving it up to a woman, ever.  Trust me.  So I&amp;#39;m curious a what the majestic &lt;a href=""/r/gaybros""&gt;/r/gaybros&lt;/a&gt; consensus will think of this fella.  Pls confirm my suspicions: closeted or ???&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How he seemeth straight/nerd/???&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Has many gay male gamer buddies but has yet to sleep with any&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plays deliberately obtuse when said buddies come onto him, and deflects their interest and comeons as if he never heard them&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Checks me and my ass and boobs out at every opportunity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Checks women of my race out at every op, too, so long as they are thin and well kept as I am&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jealous as &lt;em&gt;hell&lt;/em&gt; should any other male give me even a glance and he sees it, much less the time of day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acts genuinely depressed should I mention anyone else I&amp;#39;m dating&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dirty ass apartment.  Just unspeakable.  Horrible.  Beyond Straight Male.  40 yards past caveman.  You would die of burns there&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zero fashion sense whatsoever&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Claims female ex but not one human in our circle has ever met or seen this rare winged supernatural being&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Facebook, claims he is &amp;quot;into women&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cannot keep his eyes out of mine (I am female), cannot keeps his damned hands off me, has tried to smooch me many times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blushes if I give him a direct stare&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The back of his neck and how he walks.  I can&amp;#39;t describe the importance of each but you know exactly what I&amp;#39;m talking about.  He exhibits both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now how he seemeth gay as ever:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Has many gay male gamer buddies and not one straight one not anywhere.  In a world of straight male gamer buddies he could friend.  Hashmark things that make you go hmmm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recoiled in horror the night I finally said, ok, quit the bs; I&amp;#39;ll come to your apt and bang you, since you&amp;#39;ve asked numerous times  (but then said hours later, wait a minute, come by tomorrow during the day and I&amp;#39;ll bang you then, during the daytime.)  Pass&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;His &amp;quot;interest&amp;quot; in those women similar to me seems bogus as hell; something fake about it in big bold italic letters.  Similarly I think him checking out my ass and boobs is acting.  I think he&amp;#39;s scared to come out and I&amp;#39;ve told him he needs to.  He replied &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m straight.  You don&amp;#39;t know everything and you don&amp;#39;t know me as well as you think you do.&amp;quot;  BullSHIT, bitch, I was in gay clubs before you were born and before it was a trend, back when it was dangerous, and I was not drinking and nuisancing my gay bros whilst there but instead drinking and waiting for my then girlfriends to get there, so you don&amp;#39;t fool ANYBODY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Into musical theatre, hates all other forms of music, telling me, &amp;quot;I just love the &amp;#39;journey&amp;#39; showtunes take you on&amp;#39;; have you ever heard a straight male say this?  That&amp;#39;s right girls NEVER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;His Voice.  All the bells and whistles, ladies.  ALL the bells and whistles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;His hands and mannerisms while talking.  All the bells and whistles, girls, plus a donut.  And this is a pink frosting jelly donut with sprinkles on top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a stunningly beautiful woman is in the room with him, he folds his arms and steps back from her, eyeing her with faintly cold hostility.  He did this to a runway model friend of mine recently who I am hoping to bone.  (I am female, so is she.)  This makes me wonder since I&amp;#39;m considered hotness and straight males crawl all over me, WTF does this queen want from me?  Do I seem &lt;em&gt;that male?  Really?&lt;/em&gt;  :(&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fears sex, fears intimacy, refuses to smoke, refuses to smoke a J, even refuses alcohol, and claims he is &amp;quot;religious&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, about me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rich.  Exotic.  Tall.  Awesome place, awesome career.  Manymany many straight men after me.  Bisexual but mostly lez.  Been to every club, scrubbed every glory hole, worked at every AIDS benefit organization as a volunteer, worn a strap on, seen it all.  Interested in 100% straight men for now.  Will never be into a 100% gay male as a partner.  Sorry, it&amp;#39;s got zero bennies for women and this is not a charity.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So: Cinderella Princess acts like he can&amp;#39;t live more than a day without me but I have no interest in being the Barbara Valentin to his Freddie Mercury.  Frankly I have women and straight men to screw in my life and this would be a waste of time stepback that only benefits HIM.  He&amp;#39;s all over me like he&amp;#39;s my jedi apprentice and I&amp;#39;m over it.  He&amp;#39;s maybe the eightieth young gay to do this to me in my lifetime and, I am flattered, but um... no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because free rent and counseling while coming out ain&amp;#39;t free and all you girls know it.  Therefore what the fuck is with this guy?  I&amp;#39;ve read that sometimes Hardcore Nerd resembles The Gay, but my feeling is nope, this boy is Simply Gay and hoping to play rent boy while fucking around with other boys on the side or poaching from the straight fools I bring home, and you know, at near 50 that&amp;#39;s just no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been there and I know better, I see through it, I saw through it in 1986, and so there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah: he knows what a glory hole is.  At 26.  Yet claims he&amp;#39;s straight.  Lawd have mercy.  Uh huh, you&amp;#39;re straight; yeah right&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdict?&lt;/p&gt;

I moved to a new state in the west coast a few months back after graduating college. I met one guy who I really hit it off with and have been dating for about 2 and a half months. We have never talked about exclusivity or relationship stuff, but he has told me on different occasions that I'm the only person he's seeing and interested in pursuing.

He has a lot of attributes I really like about him. He's sweet, caring, dorky, attractive, and funny. There are some things I don't like, but no deal breakers. We've had little fights here and there and one where I honestly thought we would break up, but we end up making up every time. I've met a lot of his friends, went to his hometown with him, and spend 2-3 days a week with him.

However, there's another guy in the picture. I met this guy maybe 2 or 3 weeks after the first one. He doesn't know about the first guy, and has also mentioned that he's not interested in seeing anyone else aside from me. We get along really well and have a good time together. Chemistry wise, I think I like him a bit more than the first guy. However, I think that personality-wise, I'm more like the first guy. When I'm hanging out with the first guy, I get more of a sense that he is relationship material. With this guy, I sorta feel like he's more of a nice guy who is fun to spend time with for the moment but I'm not sure whether I see long term potential in him.

The problem is that I can't decide who I want. Neither of them know about the other and I feel awful because I don't want to hurt them or cheat on them, but it's starting to feel that way as things get more serious. The first guy asked me if we were in a relationship today and I kind of weaseled my way out of it, but I can't keep it going.

The reason why I'm still seeing the second guy is because we have a lot less fights and disagreements than with the first guy, and as awful as it sounds, I basically want to keep him around in case that things fail with the first guy. 

I feel pretty shitty about the situation but can't figure out what would be best to do. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll try to keep it as brief as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

My ex absolutely refuses to talk to me, but both of them remain friends.  Alley hasn't said anything about it, but I know the tension stresses her out. Her other best friend adds  fuel to the fire because she hates him, and it very vocal about it.  I have refrained from saying anything bad about him though.
