Never posted here before, but I would love some input.

So a month ago, I messaged a guy on OkCupid, and we seemed to hit it off well.  Set a date to meet the next Thursday, exchanged numbers, etc.  Oddly, we met a day before the date we set to do some bar trivia together, just the two of us (held onto 2nd until slipping to 7th by the end, but it was a valiant effort).  Afterwards, randomly drove around without finding much else to do, but it gave us a chance to talk more, and by the end of the night, we did kiss before we parted.  And even better, STILL decided to meet the very next day on the date we set before.

On that officially set date, I took him out to dinner at one of my favorite places in town, and got to learn more about him.  Decided to take him to my place afterwards, and I had been curious to see what he could do on piano (learned he's been playing since he was a kid, and I play it, too), so I took him home with me afterwards.  We took turns playing stuff for each other, and he just wowed me the whole time (first thing I asked if he could play was Underground by Ben Folds Five).  It was a great time playing things together and singing and such.  Eventually got to cuddling together, and I decided to ask him what he was looking for.  He said ""If you have that figured out for me, let me know, but for now I kind of don't know.""  Which I understood because most who are new to a place don't usually feel up for settling.  After just being in each others' embraces for a few hours, I took him back home.  And I'd see him again for the next 4 days in a row, which for me is highly unusual.  Spent nearly the whole weekend together (had him stay over, too).

So we'd meet up for bar trivia, and one weekend, we'd spend the day helping him shop for furniture and housewares and I'd even take him out of the city to hike.  Thanks to his job with the city's performing arts center, he even took me to see a Broadway musical for free (Pippin is awesome!).  And we'd just have some random nights at his place watching TV until terribly late hours just cuddling and enjoying each others' company.  You know, typical dating stuff. On one of those nights, I was too drunk to drive back home, so I stayed at his place, and I forgot how it came up, but he remarked that I might be too good for him.  And I said I'd ultimately be the judge of that.  But it stuck in my mind after that.

At this point, I've learned quite a bit about him, and it's incredibly apparent that we are two very different people.  The one thing we have in common is a love for music.  We can talk about artists to each other without much explanation just because of how much we each know, and jamming out together is like sonic sex (did a really fun off-the-cuff cover of Weezer's Say it Ain't So with him on keys and myself on guitar).  But from there, BOY do we diverge.  I've got very typically geeky interests (sciences, gaming, etc), whereas he's a pop culture aficionado who likes all sorts of trashy media I could never get into without cringing.  He's a lot more of an extrovert than I ever could be: the type who can engage in conversation with strangers easily if he feels like it.  He actually has a pop music podcast, and he's even done standup comedy.  But... the most important difference is in how we see the world and conduct ourselves:  I'm a very type A person at times who has a tendency to think and care too much about things, and he's the polar opposite.  He's someone who goes with the flow, worries very little, and doesn't find most things too important to care that much about.  And I often wondered how a guy like him could spend so much time with me without getting bored yet.  I actually mentioned that to him once, and he simply wondered how I could think that, but he drifted off to sleep before I could ponder a clear answer.

Anyway, last Monday, I tried taking him to a very romantic spot out of the city that had a great view of it at night, but he didn't seem to care to spend time actually by me.  I could hear him wandering about as I sat and looked at the city lights.  I figure that I'd want to pick his brain about where ""we"" could be and where ""this"" could go just to be clear.  But... a few days later, I find out through a friend that he was run into downtown holding hands with another guy.  After finding that out, I felt a little bad, but I still had plans to meet at his place to help him build some Ikea furniture and to have another trivia night.  He more or less acted the same way we normally would together.  Him in my lap or my embrace while watching TV for hours, etc.  It was getting really late, so I knew I had to go, but I decided to wait until I was about to leave to spring that question on him.  Gave him a little more background information as to why I wanted to know, too, and he was understanding.  His answer was pretty much what I expected: that he was just having fun with me and not really feeling pressure to commit to anything.  And I was fine with that...

But I realize that it can't work all that well with me in the long run.  At the same time, just noting how different we are, I don't think that helps out for something more stable in the longterm, either.  And I'm definitely not the type to handle that there are others enjoying him when I'm not, esp. in that context.

So... my real predicament is whether or not I should say more than I already have just to release myself and to preserve at least a friendship.  Should I say I know what I know?  Should I explain that I think he's really cool, but I understand now that I know I can offer him more than he could ever return to me?  Or should I just leave well enough alone because he doesn't have the same level of care or worry that I do, anyway?

TL;DR, getting too close to liking someone who likely isn't good for me in the longrun, but should I explain myself more so I could at least maintain a friendship?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey, guys.  Never posted here before, but I would love some input.&lt;/p&gt;

I am writing basically to encourage younger men who find themselves in this situation, and to ask that other men who know little or nothing about this area, yet still want to give advice, think twice before accusing, discounting, or trivializing the experience of many of us.
From what I read here, the usual pattern is that a younger man will write in to wonder if what he is going through with an older man in an intimate relationship is OK, healthy, beneficial, etc.  Then, many other men who have no personal understanding write in to denounce it as sick, pedophile, even  incestuous.  The younger man backs off, left feeling bad about himself for reasons that most likely have absolutely nothing to do with his situation at all.  I would like to counter this by speaking as a man who learned about sexual intimacy and love, being held, valued and treasured as a human being, by older men, and as a man who lived through it and can now look back on my life and say quite insistently that  I am so glad it happened; and I doubt that I could have come to maturity and the knowledge of love if these men had not been there.

I don't know if there is a general pattern for boys and young men attracted to those older than themselves.  In my own case, I came out of a childhood of extreme physical and emotional abuse from my mother while my father did nothing to stop her.  The only time I ever called her “mommy” was when it was part of “Mommy, please don't hit me.”  But it never stopped her.  I never knew what being touched, held, embraced, wanted or loved was.  By the time I was 14, I was actively seeking this away from home.  It meant hanging around public washrooms and making myself available by what I later learned was called “cruising.”  I automatically gravitated to older men—at 14, that meant any guy over 18.  As I got more experience it settled on men in their late 20's and in their 30's.  I wasn't looking for just getting my rocks off, but connection with someone who cared about me and showed it.  I sure wasn't going to get this with kids my own age—that meant circle jerks and scout camp orgies which was not what I was after.  Older guys were more gentle, kinder, not selfish, and wanted to make me feel good as much as I wanted to make them feel good.  Whenever they asked me, “What do you like to do?” I would always answer, “Whatever gets you off gets me off.”  And I meant it.

I was never taken advantage of, never used in a demeaning way, never asked to do anything I didn't want to do. And I wasn't “seduced” by dirty old men.  Actually I was often the aggressor—oblivious of the troubleI could be getting the older guy in.  Where I live, 16 is the age of consent, so I only had some year and a half of having to be careful.  Then I could fuck with whomever I wanted to.  My parents must have known, but they didn't care anyway.  So I could play Robin to a friend's Batman, Justin to another man's Brian with no one to stop me.  With the help of the older men I met,I learned what being loved and wanted and valued was about.  I left it to my school mates to think about the prom, how to buy beer on Saturday night,or even maybe get lucky, while I learned about life in a much more mature and romantic way.  I was still pretty young in the way I looked and thought, so it wasn't until I was 18 –emotionally more like 16—I got a job sailing on a survey ship sailing the Pacific.  There I met a 23-year old fellow crewman.  23 was still for me “older”  He was quite a man, and quite a lover.  That was my first time in love, and what an all-comsuming passion it was.  He was smart, funny, was the biggest, toughest man on board,  could take down any other man on the ship (I had seen him do it.) AND he had a Ford convertable—our magic carpet to one adventure after another when we were in port.

I don't remember actually seeking out older men, but that was the way it always seemed to work out—fine by me.  When I got to be in my late 20's and 30's myself, the age of men who I found interesting to hook up with did not continue to go up, but stayed there, but guys in their 40's were looking pretty good.  I don't  know if this is the general pattern, but I never did suddenly begin to like men much younger—i.e., to reverse the process.  Even in my fantasy life, I was still the younger man—but in real life it no longer mattered.

Those of you familiar with Greek history will recognize what I have been describing as the typical pattern amongst Greek warriors of the Beloved/Protector relationship.   The Greeks had the same-age gay relationships that we have, but the older-younger one was more common.  Straight biblical scholars try their best to discount this, but many people read the friendship between the older Jonathan and the younger David in the books of Samuel in the way I have described.

I am writing to urge you men who are in such relationships not to feel guilty or insecure about them, but to learn from them, and bring to them the same degree of passion and maturing that characterize other kinds of gay relationships.  To those of you who would dismiss them as by their nature, a priori, sick, you are slaying dragons where none exist.

Out of my main group of friends, there are three straight couples. None of them have gone very far, and none seem very romantically affectionate compared to the vast majority of couples in our school. If that's how they roll then I'm in no place to judge them, but the guys are super affectionate to each other to the extent that the girls have confessed they're uncomfortable about it and unsure about their boyfriends' sexualities. Their boyfriends regularly (like multiple times daily) joke about having sex with each other and are super grabby with each other.

Also, one of my friends and his other (male) friend were at a party a couple weeks ago and both were really touchy with each other and with me (guys just seem to like to touch me, I'm certainly not complaining!). We were all drunk, and friendly arms-around-the-shoulder turned into nipple-poking, and the other friend did body shots and decided that most clothing was optional, while saying that I was a really cool guy whenever he saw me. I was kind of attracted to him but didn't want to risk acting on it at a party and possibly turn out to be wrong and just make things awkward. I know the first friend is attracted to girls (I've only occasionally wondered if there's more to it than just that), but his  friend (the second one) was way more uninhibitedly homoerotic than I've ever seen a supposedly straight guy be.

What I'm wondering is, does my circle of friends seem closeted? I know that friends can be affectionate, and that I could be reading everything wrong, and that even if they are closeted then that's for them to figure out; however gaydar is a thing, and I'm just confused about this whole situation. I feel bad for the girlfriends to have to deal with the uncertainty, but I'm obviously staying out of that. The guy I met at the party, however, was attractive, although I'm hesitant on whether or not to act on it. Thoughts on any of this?

Edit: to make it more clear, I'm not attracted to any of my male friends with girlfriends, their dynamic just confuses me. I am attracted to the guy I met at the party (my friend's friend) who has no contact with my main group of friends except through that one friend. This is ultimately two separate issues, then. The one thing I was hesitant about is that guy could tell my friend (if I were to express that I'm interested), who might be weirded out, but now that I've thought about it there's really no way that that news would get to my main friend group, let alone mess anything up.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This seemed to be the right sub for this, correct me if not.&lt;/p&gt;

Or disowned... or beaten... yet now I hate myself more than when I was in the closet.

[Here is my previous post with back story for this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/2hak6n/at_this_point_is_there_one/). ***TL;DR:*** Dad is a short tempered angry/racist/sexist man. Can be a poster boy outside the house, inside, true colors. He told me when I was 10 he would disown me if I was gay. Lived in a mental prison terrified of what he would do if he found out. For reference, when I asked my mom to ""please shut up"", I was told I broke the 5th commandment, was going to burn in hell for doing so, and had to sit on a church pew (yes we had one) in the front hall, could not go anywhere else unless it was for diner, bathroom, or bed. If there is one lesson dad wanted me to learn, it was ""do not fuck with me, and do as I say"".

So when I was sat down, yelled at ""Why are you even in this house if you are so angry all the time, why don't you get the hell out if you hate it so much here"" etc. I finally told them I was gay, and that I was in the closet because dad said he would disown me.

He said ""Oh I don't remember that, that was me at a different time, I hope you know I'm not that person anymore"" and some other consoling words that I honestly still do not believe.

The thing is, parents have gone on as if I didn't come out, as if nothing has changed, like the conversation never happened. I get that they are trying to do it to let me know that nothing has changed and they wont treat me differently, but all I see is them going ""Oh your dad told you when you where a child that he would disown you if you are what you are? Oh you know he didn't mean that now right? That was him then not now.""

What is ~~literally~~ figuratively killing me inside (almost literally), is that apparently, his opinion changed somewhere along the line, and I could/should have come out sooner. All I can think of now is the fucking DECADE AND A HALF of life I spent in a mental prison going day to day with the fucking fear my dad would go biblical on my ass like he said he would, instead of the ANYTHING that could have happened if I came out when I knew. 

Would I have maybe had a boyfriend by now. Probably. Would I have not been forced to join the military just to get out of the house. Probably. Would I have had other avenues to meet people outside of apps and not gotten raped (is it rape if a bottom blackmails a top into sex, I don't know :\). I sure as fucking hope so. 

My parents are happy as clams because ""oh wow he was able to have the courage to come out"" and blah blah blah, and here I am just hating myself for the things that should/could/would have been. I know I can't change the past, and someone is going to quote me the ""it gets better"" but ""it gets better"" is for teen and preteen kids. I, due to the shit cards I have been dealt, have ended back home at 26. My romantic life is non existent, sexual life has been significantly damaged thanks to one asshole, and I can't really find happiness in anything. 

tl;dr: my life at home is shit. I know I have to get out. But I have been trough so much shit that I don't even think its possible/worth it to try and be happy. I hate every story I see about peoples fond memories of sex/fun they had in their teen years, or hell, at all. And knowing that I spent the same years grounded and loathing my father/existence. I don't want to overuse reddits go to self diagnosis, but I am pretty sure I am depressed and on the road to... worse thoughts (I refuse to say the act).

So has anyone's coming out made their life shittier, or make them hate/self loath more? I know therapy is going to come up but I cannot afford it, cannot have another ""talk"" with parents about this. I don't need to call a suicide hotline, but I don't need to be a therapist to know that this isn't normal and could/will most likely just get worse...

I hadn't had a ton to drink at that point... maybe five or six total drinks, which isn't a lot for me.  Usually I'm fairly careful, as in I watch drinks and only get drinks directly from a bartender.  I don't remember anything strange happening that night, but I was having fun and wasn't really on the lookout for potential strange behavior.  At one point, I remember feeling the spins and thinking ""wow, how did I get so drunk?""

My friend says I disappeared when he was in the bathroom.  He called and texted me a bunch of times.

I suddenly wake up on this futon in a strange apartment.  I'm naked and still feel drunk/out of it.  I look around and see a guy in his 30s asleep on a bed.  I feel bad, so I just want to get the hell out of there.  I immediately grab all my stuff (wallet, phone, keys are all still in my pocket), and I peace out.  I never said anything to the guy or even checked what address I was at.  I just wanted to get home.

I went back to sleep and wasn't really sure what to think until later that afternoon.  I reflected on the night and realized something was off.  I don't get that drunk like that all of the sudden ever, especially when I only had beers to drink.  I also examined my body and found bruises on my shoulders.  My asshole was really red and hurt too - I never bottom, but I feel like from the way it was hurting, something was shoved up there.

Obviously I got myself tested right away (all is clear).  I told the doctor what happened, and he gave me some materials.  I also told my friends about it, and they freaked out.  They asked me if I was ok, if I needed anything, blah blah blah.  I skimmed some of the materials I was given and thought ""eh, this is kind of pointless.""

I honestly do not feel upset by this at all.  I mean, sure, the dude that probably raped me is a huge asshole, but I'm not angry or upset.  I'm pissed off that he made me have to go through STD testing/brought me home so I missed the rest of the night with my friend, but that's about it.  I can't seem to be angry about the situation.  All in all, it didn't turn out *that* bad.  It could have gone way worse.  If anything, I'm a little flattered that he chose me to target.  Like he knew he'd never get with me unless he raped me.  

My friends keep making such a big deal about it, and if anything is pissing me off, it's them.  My one friend is trying way too hard to be supportive and keeps saying things like, ""You're not a victim, you're a *survivor*"" and ""you're strong enough to get through this.""  It gets me mad, because I tell them it's really not a big deal, and they say I need to eventually confront this situation.  I already did confront it: I got roofed, I got fucked by the ass by a stranger, and I left (with no stolen things or STDs).  It could have gone way worse, but it didn't.  It's over.  No excuse crying over spilled milk.

The fact that a select group of people doted on me and keep asking *are you really ok?* is bothering me a bit.  I almost feel inhuman for feeling so... indifferent about this.  I've felt worse about shitty one night stands before.  At least in this case, it wasn't my fault.  I know I was technically ""violated"" but I don't feel violated at all.  If anything, it's becoming to turn into kind of a humorous story for me.  It's so absurd that somehow this guy not only got a roofie into my drink, but got a full grown roofied man home.

Is this normal to feel?  Has anyone gone through this?  I'm just exasperated by my friends, because I know they're trying to be supportive, but it's doing the opposite.  It's making me feel like I *should* be all outraged and angry and upset when I'm not.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was at a gay bar one night with a friend.
