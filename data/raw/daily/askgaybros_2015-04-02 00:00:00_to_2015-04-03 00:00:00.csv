*1) It's completely normal for two straight men to be able to love each other, it doesn't have to necessarily be a THING.

*2) He comes off as so smug and ""enlightened""

*3) There is no mention of if they actually consummated their relationship.  Shouldn't he at least say if the relationship is sexual in nature or not if they are ""in love""?  And if so, how does he feel about having sex with a man, if he was ""straight""?

*4) How did others actually react?

So here's the big one: was molested at a young age several times by a friends father. Dealth with that one, talked to him this past year (I'm 25), things are good. Grew up in a Catholic, then Baptist church. Same old story, parents are religious, lead to self loathing/hating, couldn't really come out to them until I was 23. Again things are good, much better than expected. Before coming out I fell for a straight guy... hard, I have a feeling a lot of people do this.

Now the only mildly unsettling part of this is my attraction to older guys. This friend I mentioned happened to be early fifties at the time. I typically get along well with people older than me, particularly the late boomer generation. Sometimes this get attributed to being molested by my friends father, other times by my personality. Honestly I'm just not sure anymore. The reason it bothers me is because I feel maybe I'm just denying myself a regular normal relationship with someone nearer my age. I just haven't found myself attracted to people my own age yet.

The only other explanations I've had for why I have the attraction is that older people match my personality rather well. I had to grow up fast due to several circumstances in life that isn't in the opening paragraph. I'm also an only child who was often around older people. I'm told I'm mature for my age. I do most things at a slower pace, I'm not techno consumed, I don't stare at my phone 15 of my 16 hours of being awake, and I'm 100% cool with that.

So I'm a 20 year old college student, and I realized that my boners have been more ""spongy"" than before. Previously, everytime I'd jack off or hook up with someone, my dick would get super rock hard and it'd be great. Now, my dick has still been perfectly functional, just significantly less hard.

Things I think could have caused it: I had a period where I jacked off every single day. I'm trying to limit this a little bit. I'm also in a bit of a dry spell (around 6 months) and I'm going through a decent amount of stress in my life with college and stuff. On the flip side, I don't do drugs/drink very little at the moment and I exercise daily (almost excessively, god damn sports).

What can I do to fix this?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey Bros,&lt;/p&gt;

So I've recently picked up the flute as a musical instrument (I like to put my lips to something long and hard....) I'm going to use the power of music to get inside boys hearts. I want to learn a list of romantic songs I can play on dates that will tip the edge in getting boys to fall in love with me.

So bros, if you were on a romantic date and you end up at the beach on a warm summers night and your date plays you a song, what would that song/songs be? What songs would tug at your heartstrings and make you melt?

I would prefer some type of ballad. The song I have in mind that I really want to learn is Halo by Beyonce, because it has a beautiful melody and beautiful lyrics (not that I'll be able to sing the lyrics but anyone know the song would likely know some of the words), and would sound lovely on the flute. However looking at the sheet music I think that song is a little advanced (sixteenth tones and 3 octaves, the 3rd octave is hard to play on the flute without a lot of practice). I will learn it eventually but I'm looking for other songs to learn as well.

Some of the other song choices I'm going to learn

California King Bed - Rihanna

Gypsy - Lady Gaga

Beautiful Cuz You Love Me - Girls Aloud (yeah I know it's a flop but I really like the song)

I Don't Know How To Love Him - Jesus Christ Superstar (I'm not opposed to learning show tunes, plus this song looks fairly easy)

I don't listen to a huge variety of music, so help a bro out! All suggestions are welcome, unless they're like heavy metal or rap (songs with my melody generally sounds crap on an instrument lol). You never know, I might play you your song when I ask you out on a date. ;)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi bros.

I haven't had sex for five months. The body is definitely yearning. I've had no problem being slutty in the past, and yet I think I've developed some weird aversion to hooking up. Like I waste time casually looking for one, and then find a reason not to. Should I just do it and get it over with?

The long version (and warning, yes I do have a tendency to answer my own questions when I write them out): In college and a few years after I really only had one vice: sex. I look back at it like ""Wow, I was really, really slutty."" But I don't really regret it. I was making safe, mostly sober decisions. I mostly think ""Yeah, but that was pretty hot."" 

Then things happen. Relationship and relationship-ish situations made me really appreciate sex with real emotion. Sex drives start to wane a little bit. The friends I hang out with now are kind of prudes with ""good gay morals"" (nothing wrong with that) and when they talk about their sex lives (or lack there of) it doesn't make me feel bad, but kind of weird and maybe their morals rubbing off on me. Plus I'm just older and everything that comes with it: responsibilities, more wisdom, and the fact some people would rather fuck a whatever 18y/o than a decent look 28y/o. 

So I've been single for well over a year. I've attempted a few hooks ups in that time. They were mostly disappointing. One with a guy I had hooked up with a few times years ago. It was decent, but just not the same. Another was one of those ""Wow, you're so close"" Grindr shenanigans. He was ready to go the second I walked in. Like wasted no time trying to get it in, but had a lot of trouble actually doing that and we never quite got in a rhythm and just as soon as we almost did he pulled out and finished. I spent literally 10 minutes in that apt, then noticed he blocked me on Grindr as soon as I left. Few times had I felt as gross about myself after sex. The last time was a few days before Halloween, so about five months ago. Total dead fish. Would not do any of the work. I may have been a slut, but I only do all the work for love, money, or a really good ""You won't believe who I slept with..."" story (I'm only kidding about one of those). But damn it did I try to squeeze some passion out of that. I was trying my hardest to at least make this a good experience ...and then he lost his boner and said he could only keep going if we did bareback, so I politely finished myself up and left. So yeah a shitty string of hook ups that kind of turned me off the idea for a while. 

But ever since sometime in January or early February the urges have
returned. The problem is, I just can't find it in myself to do it. The worst is sometimes I'll come home on a night when I have nothing to do, like a Monday or Tuesday, and wind up wasting it with a combination of looking on the hook up apps, porn and various other non-sex internet wastes in between. Which is stupid because who else is looking for a hook up on a Monday? I mean, I've even logged into Adam4Adam for the first time in forever! 

And when I do find someone who seems like a possibility I find excuses not to like, ""Eh, too far away ...that is definitely too big for me to handle right now ...you know, but I could just finish up on my own in five minutes.""  And I'm not even that proactive about looking for it. I know I'd get better results with a shirtless photo or sending more than ""Hi, how are you"" but I just can't seem to be bothered. 

Yet, I really need --what is the technical term-- to get banged the fuck out. It's literally physical, and its starting to fuck with me head. I'm wasting so much time just looking for it, and I think it makes me awkward around boys I could want more from and is kind of fucking with my self esteem. 

(Plus, anecdotally, it seems like the last time I was in major hook up mode there's a lot more guys on hook up sites with ""Not here to hook up"" or are only into bareback sex. I find it so weird, but anyway.) 

But should I just do it? It's pretty apparent I'm terrified of another bad experience and kind of influenced by having more prudish friends now a days, but I should just find someone who really seems into me and into good sex and find a way to make it work, right? Is there anyway to get this all out of my head?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll put the TL;DR upfront: I&amp;#39;m single.

Which is stupid because who else is looking for a hook up on a Monday? I mean, I&amp;#39;ve even logged into Adam4Adam for the first time in forever! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when I do find someone who seems like a possibility I find excuses not to like, &amp;quot;Eh, too far away ...that is definitely too big for me to handle right now ...you know, but I could just finish up on my own in five minutes.&amp;quot;  And I&amp;#39;m not even that proactive about looking for it. I know I&amp;#39;d get better results with a shirtless photo or sending more than &amp;quot;Hi, how are you&amp;quot; but I just can&amp;#39;t seem to be bothered. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, I really need --what is the technical term-- to get banged the fuck out. It&amp;#39;s literally physical, and its starting to fuck with me head. I&amp;#39;m wasting so much time just looking for it, and I think it makes me awkward around boys I could want more from and is kind of fucking with my self esteem. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Plus, anecdotally, it seems like the last time I was in major hook up mode there&amp;#39;s a lot more guys on hook up sites with &amp;quot;Not here to hook up&amp;quot; or are only into bareback sex. I find it so weird, but anyway.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But should I just do it? It&amp;#39;s pretty apparent I&amp;#39;m terrified of another bad experience and kind of influenced by having more prudish friends now a days, but I should just find someone who really seems into me and into good sex and find a way to make it work, right? Is there anyway to get this all out of my head?&lt;/p&gt;

Ok, this is going to sound whiny, so I apologize in advance.  My friends keep offering platitudes but I want some good, actual advice.

I'm a 24-year-old law student.  I go on a lot of dates.  I average about two or three a week, which isn't easy since I'm pretty busy with school, and I like to hang out with friends as much as possible.  I also don't go on dates on Friday and Saturday nights because I prefer going out and meeting randoms at bars.  I have dates lined up for the next two weeks on every free night I'm available. These dates are always first, second, or third dates - I haven't made it to  a fourth date in an awfully long time.

I always find excuses not to get too involved with a guy.  I have this idea of the ""perfect"" guy in my head: cute, tall, preppy, my height, good career prospects, and comes from a nice family.  It seems like all the guys that I go on dates with fall short of this ideal guy.  They're all either too short or too feminine or too artsy or too unambitious or not as cute as I thought they were, and so and so forth.  I keep giving guys first, second, and third chances in the hopes that we really click, but nothing has stuck yet.

Up until a couple of weeks ago, I always assumed it was ok, and that I had every right to be picky.  I see myself as a good looking guy, in decent shape, intelligent, and ambitious.  I get enough attention on apps and websites that this view hasn't really been challenged, except with guys I actually liked.  I've been on a few dates with guys who 100% fit into my ""perfect guy"" mold.  But the shitty thing is that they never want to go on as many dates as I do.  It always fizzles out on the second or third date.  I feel like they're me and I'm the guys I date.  (Note: this isn't because I get too clingy or desperate or anything.  I'm pretty socially savvy and know how to handle myself.)

Also, I don't seem to match with as many guys that I really like on Tinder, and the guys that really stick out to me on Grindr often don't respond.  It's much harder to set up dates with the kind of guy I want than dates with other guys.  For instance, today I messaged two new Tinder matches.  One was like ideal - basically everything I'm looking for (so it seems) in a nutshell.  The other was really hot but he's auditioning for Broadway and I noticed I'm usually not too into theater types, plus he's a couple of inches too short.  As usual, the good guy didn't respond to me, but the theater guy did (I have a date with him next week now).  It drives me insane that the guy I got all excited about isn't even responding to me.  Meanwhile, I'm going to go out with this theater guy and probably bang him a couple of times and then leave.  If I could just get over myself and have a realistic view of who I have a shot with and who I don't, I could probably have so much of a better time with him and not feel like I should be ""doing better.""

Anyone know how to get a more realistic view of myself, so I'm not chasing these mystical, unobtainable guys and instead am satisfied with what I can get?  I have never had a SERIOUS boyfriend before.  I feel like I'm doomed to date around and will never settle down, when I feel emotionally ready to take the next step with someone.  There's so many guys out there, but I can't shake the feeling like I can do better, when that cannot be the case.  I feel like this is the curse of gay men - there are always more options out there, so we're always looking for what could be next instead of what we can actually get.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throwaway.

The problem is this will be the first time we have actually hung out together without his or my parents around.  I really would like to get know my cousin better because we rarely see each other.  I'm extremely close with all my cousins on that side of the family but him and his brother. 

I mean who knows he could be living it up at college and just hasn't come out yet.  I know everything is going well and he loves it there. I'll let you know what happens, stay tuned!

Of course, Dan Savage isn't exactly responsible for the mental health issues that kicked in when I was a freshman as well as the onslaught of other terrible things (sexual assault, family issues, my father got cancer, etc.). At least...I don't think he is.  
  
And yet, I think the one thing I'm regretting about my upcoming graduation is that I haven't had sex with anyone at my school and overall I had sex very few times. I never dated. I tried, but never really got a response from men in the area and was told that due to my skin color I would have to wait until I moved to a city or a more accepting place if I ever wanted to meet someone and fall in love. I was hopeful that it wouldn't be the case, but it was.  
  
I haven't given up yet. Right now I am sexually repressed, sexually frustrated, lonely, and am ten pounds overweight (I've lost 20 lbs. now though and am still working on my body), but I'm hopeful for after graduation. However, I was also hopeful around my high school graduation.  
  
College just wasn't what it was supposed to be. Nowhere close to what I had imagined for myself. I spent most of the time alone after freshman year. I have very few friends despite being a member of many student organizations. I always feel a weird disconnect from other people. As nice as people are and as easy it is for me to initially make friends, I've never in my life felt like I ever belonged anywhere.  
  
But I've accepted my situation for what it is. I know that life rarely goes exactly how you wanted it to. The normal wasn't my college experience, but that's okay. However, I worry about the rest of my life. I'm only 21, but being so sexually and romantically inexperienced while seeing so many of my gay peers have so much success in those realms has made me feel like a social failure. Over time, this insecurity has turned into a powerhouse of sexual anxiety. At first I was constantly rejected by all other men, even before my weight gain freshman year, and now I'm not sure if I've just gone through all the once available men at my school or if I just don't put myself out there enough because of the probably more than one hundred rejections I've faced from men over my course at this school.  
    
I can't live like this anymore. I realize that they say that if you don't try, you won't win. But what if you've been trying for four entire years and encounter failure after failure after failure? What if the failures have turned you into a reclusive shut-in who shies away from all contact with gay men out of fear that more sexual rejection could possibly destroy me?  
  
I feel terrible for saying this, but now I can look at the psychopaths who become murderers and other evil things with more sympathy now. I am not mentally ill or capable of such horrors and I'm not saying they aren't responsible (oh, they are), but I can understand how what I've felt every day for the past three to four year could break someone who has such a weak state of mind that leads people to such things. I often feel like the shell of the man I once was. Hell, I don't even feel like a man. I feel castrated. I feel sexually and romantically worthless and rejected. I often think about killing myself, but then I realize that killing yourself because you can't get laid or can't get a boyfriend is a bit silly compared to how much this world can offer you, even if my feelings are warranted.
