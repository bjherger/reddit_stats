I've BEEN ready to be honest, and been trying.  But I feel like meeting guys, especially in my area, is dreadfully hard.

I live in a rural town about an hour from NYC.  We don't have any gay bars around here, although I do attempt to go to the ones that are either in the city or about 45 minutes away from time to time.  I think most of us can agree this really isn't the best atmosphere for meeting guys.  Its worth a try, and I do, but going to a bar for the sake of finding someone to be with is a flaw within itself.

I'm on grindr...I'm not proud of it, but I am.  I'm genuinly looking to build a bigger gay-social circle, and to go on dates.  But the app is a mess.  If I look through the list of guys there, narrow by people reasonably close to my age (23 - 33), guys that actually have a face and aren't a bland torso...alright, lets then get rid of the guys that are blatantly not real....then lets focus on ones who don't have ""Come Fuck Me"" in their profiles...and lets look for ones that I'm at least a little attracted to.  Alright, cool, there's one guy left.  Then I'll message him ""Hey, hows it going? I'm Tim."" Not exactly filled with personality in the message but...hey, I literally don't know him.  

Then...nothing.  Its ok though, my ego is used to getting tossed around a little

I'm trying online dating (POF/okcupid), but to the same level of wackiness.  Any guys that seem approachable or like-able are either unrealistically far away(Hey Luke from Michigan) or just don't say hi back.  Part of it might be because I don't photograph well.  I know this sounds vain, but its a fact of my life, that multiple people have mentioned to me.  I like to think of myself as an attractive guy, but it doesn't come across in (most) photos.

Newbie here!

So a few months ago I met this man online and we met up that night to hookup. That night was great! We talked, cuddled and just kept each other company.

FAST FORWARD A MONTH

I go over to his house again and we have a GREAT time with each other! Our conversation went from talking about ourselves to musicals and back to ourselves. He's so great to talk to and I'm feeling very comfortable with him! Then it happens... he tells me he has a Boyfriend.

I'm not surprised. With my luck, I'm used to this. So I told him I didn't care, as long as he was honest with me(I forgot to ask him if he was in an open relationship but I asked a few weeks later and he confirmed that he's been in this relationship for about 20 years and that they are indeed open) and we continued with our situation.

At this point, I'm intrigued. I've heard of open relationships but I wanted to know more! I was starting to become interested in this guy and the more I knew about his situation(without being invasive and asking) the more I knew how to handle our situation. Well, I stumbled upon Polyamory. To make a long story short - I really like it! The idea of potentially receiving and giving love from/to more than one guy really connects with me! Now, as someone who is inexperienced, I understand that I could be in a ""Dream"" type stage but I really think I want to explore it!

Now to the point.

When we're together, its SURREAL! Every time we meet its more and more intimate and our time together has become precious to me. Earlier tonight he told me that he really loved talking to me and being with me and we just starred into each others eyes and held each other.. I could have DIED, it was so intimate! This is what I've been dreaming about since my teen years and for it to happen now?! I just cant believe that he has NO interest in something more than sex with me whatsoever! By the way, he has not said anything about only wanting sex. Both he and I have not said what we want from this.

I need help! How should I talk to him about.. us? How can I tell if he is interested in a polyamorous relationship? I wouldn't ask if I didn't feel like he was giving me some type of signal that he was into me. I don't know, am I just being naive? Do taken/married guys usually act like this in open relationships? Should I just calm down and enjoy the sex? Seriously, I need some serious guidance!

I'M FREAKING OUT OVER HERE!

So, about two weeks after our holiday, my friend finally wanted to talk to me about what happened on that night we had sex. He has been very quiet about it and did not want to talk about it, sometimes he would plain ignore me. But I understand that he was thinking about it, as it was a very unique time for both of us. 

So I went over to his place and we talked about it for a good while and then I came out to him as Bisexual, he was happy for me, but then said that while he did enjoy it, he does not want to take it further, so does that mean that he is still closeted or not? I don't know. He knew that I had a different perceptive on what happened then he did and said that he wants to support me all the way, I'm happy that he wants to support me and my girl friends want to support me as well. But I think he is still trying to get over it, I did say he enjoyed it after all, but I think he is still trying to get his head around it.

We talked for about 3 weeks, then had our first date at a bar/arcade place.  Date went amazingly and we were there till closing, had to basically be called back to earth by the bartender because we were making out and quite drunk. I ended up going back with him to his hotel room (he wasn't from the area and didn't want to drive that far while tired and after drinking). Needless to say, I went up with him and we had sex. Woke up, had sex and then breakfast.  It went great, we regretted nothing, EXCEPT that we hadn't used condoms.  Both of us just felt way too familiar way too quickly and made a bad decision for a first date. Well, I went to his town to visit the next week and spent the night, and we had round 3, 4 and 5.  Had a great time, but round 4 was a very drunk and a little messy, he was a sport about it.  It was an amazing time, I came back feeling good about things although we had both planned to individually get tested.  Days after seeing him last, he gets a fever and neck-ache and thinks he has ARS ([acute retroviral syndrome](https://www.aids.gov/hiv-aids-basics/hiv-aids-101/signs-and-symptoms/)).  I got tested earlier this week on Monday (4 days ago) and yesterday he told me that he was experiencing a colored urethral-discharge and burning sensation: Indisputable UTI.  Now he's reasonably concerned, and honestly, I am too.  I have been more sexually active than him in the past year and although I had been tested, I did not get swabbed like this time and I worry that maybe I just didn't have symptoms and have been carrying some STD in my asshole for months.  I had intended to get tested before I slept with him, but drunk-me is a slut.  My last boyfriend once suffered some urethral ""trauma"" after we fucked without lube (just spit) and had bleeding but no other symptoms of a UTI later on.  I'm hoping (practically fucking praying) that it is just a UTI from fucking too hard bareback (and we did so once with just my spit) and not from some stow-away plague in my asshole.  I know the possibilities and I know the risk-factors of the situation and where I fucked up.  I'm just wondering if you guys have any advice as far as the relationship (still in ""talking-to/seeing"" phase).  I haven't felt this good about a guy in a really long fucking time and it would just ruin my fucking year if I scare this guy away because I surprised him with gonorrhea.  I doubt he'd trust that I had been honest with him about my sexual activity (and I have been).  My results haven't come back yet.  I know I should be equally worried about having contracted something, but he was in a commited relationship only 3 months ago and I feel like in this situation I'm the one that poses the greater threat of spreading a disease.  Any advice guys?  You can tell me how fucking stupid I am, as long as you follow it with advice. Thanks, bros.

TL;DR: Met an amazing guy, may have given him an STD. What now?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I met this guy (we&amp;#39;ll call him Dude), on a dating site. We talked for about 3 weeks, then had our first date at a bar/arcade place.  Date went amazingly and we were there till closing, had to basically be called back to earth by the bartender because we were making out and quite drunk. I ended up going back with him to his hotel room (he wasn&amp;#39;t from the area and didn&amp;#39;t want to drive that far while tired and after drinking). Needless to say, I went up with him and we had sex. Woke up, had sex and then breakfast.  It went great, we regretted nothing, EXCEPT that we hadn&amp;#39;t used condoms.  Both of us just felt way too familiar way too quickly and made a bad decision for a first date. Well, I went to his town to visit the next week and spent the night, and we had round 3, 4 and 5.  Had a great time, but round 4 was a very drunk and a little messy, he was a sport about it.  It was an amazing time, I came back feeling good about things although we had both planned to individually get tested.  Days after seeing him last, he gets a fever and neck-ache and thinks he has ARS (&lt;a href=""https://www.aids.gov/hiv-aids-basics/hiv-aids-101/signs-and-symptoms/""&gt;acute retroviral syndrome&lt;/a&gt;).  I got tested earlier this week on Monday (4 days ago) and yesterday he told me that he was experiencing a colored urethral-discharge and burning sensation: Indisputable UTI.  Now he&amp;#39;s reasonably concerned, and honestly, I am too.  I have been more sexually active than him in the past year and although I had been tested, I did not get swabbed like this time and I worry that maybe I just didn&amp;#39;t have symptoms and have been carrying some STD in my asshole for months.

Does anyone want an update? 

Well, I finally got to talk to Alex alone last week when he came over to borrow my car. (His was in the shop, he hated his loaner, I loved his loaner, he loves my car, etc.) I asked him if everything is ok because he seemed nervous ever since that night. I asked him why he felt so compelled to tell me, and he goes on about how he has a lot of love and respect for me as a friend and who better to fill those desires than me. I was pretty flattered, I love this guy, one of my best friends ever. Alex says he really has been having some conflicting feelings about everything and his GF recommended bringing another guy into the bedroom, and she would be OK with it if it was me. 

Alex says that he honestly would rather pursue these sexual desires alone, and that his GF is also OK with that. He thought I would have some aversion to coming between their relationship which is why he thought it would be a better idea if he invited me into their sex life together. 

Well, I do have some aversion to this, I think. In going through my own breakup aftermath and such, I just don't know if I have the moxie to go through with something like this. I love my friends and I would die if this doesn't work out well. When I was in high school I dated a guy for 3 years, and I didn't find out until afterwards that he was initially cheating on his then GF with me and ended up leaving her for me. I remember the feeling when I found out. I was really sad that I unknowingly came between someone's relationship. What if the same thing happens with Alex and his GF? What if he's using this opportunity to do the same? 

Anywho, I just can't believe this situation and I'm really conflicted on what to do. My friend is smoking hot and I would love nothing but to have an open kinda thing with him . Its his open relationship and not fully understanding where his head is at that confuses me. I somehow feel like I'm letting him down, though. He's very shy and it took a lot for him to even have both of these conversations with me, but the possibilities of how this could pan out is unclear to me. I'm mostly afraid of assisting in an eventual breakup. I told him that he's one of my best friends and I love him and his GF, but that I just need to clear my own thoughts.

&lt;p&gt;Him = a cute, somewhat disobedient/stubborn leather pup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me = a bear who wants to make his fantasies come true. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically so far I&amp;#39;ve read sirius pup&amp;#39;s website and learnt a few things from there on how to be an effective compassionate trainer (he&amp;#39;s submissive but doesn&amp;#39;t want a trainer/owner who is hugely into punishment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have recommendations she&amp;#39;s i can learn more.&lt;/p&gt;

I suck at writing so some portions were ~~taken from~~ inspired by other ""Dear John letters"" that I saw both on reddit and online. Below is the letter I sent:

""I'm writing you this letter because I'm afraid if I try to tell to you in person I’ll wont be capable of carrying out what now seems inevitable. It was about two years ago that I expressed my true feelings towards you. A defenseless position because ultimately, loving someone demands unveiling parts of oneself that are concealed from the rest of the world. To have such desires only to be forced to hide them is one of the greatest challenges that I’ve been through. It is agonizing to feign indifference toward you when it seems like you’re the only thing I can think of. That is why after much deliberation I feel we need to end our friendship, at least for the time being.

I’ve been trying to gain some insight on how I ended up in this position. Trying to figure out why I allowed myself to fall in love with a straight man, how I’ve managed to go on this self-destructive path that has lead to nowhere but unhappiness. Had our connection not been what it is maybe it wouldn’t be so damn hard. However, our connection is one of the greatest connections I have ever had with another person. We just get along so well that sometimes hours will pass in a conversation and we haven’t even realized it.

I should have been able to decipher the writing on the wall. I tried hard to keep my feelings under control, but I failed. I vividly recall siting beside you watching a movie in our friend’s living room, there I sat with my palms tightly pressed against my thighs, resisting every itch to hold your hands. It is this resistance and restraint I believe is the greatest expression of love and respect.

I try to go back in time and try to find what failed that allowed me to reach this point. One of my most revisited memories is the infamous Halloween themed house party in 2012. I recall being conflicted regarding how I felt towards you, but blamed it on being troubled with the fact that you had never acknowledged that I was your friend. I was conflicted because I realized, for the first time, what it felt like to be in love with someone. I forgave every wrong, I wanted to spend every living second with you, and every time we were mad at each other it felt like a thousand knives are piercing my heart. The reality is that you would never feel the same for me. I realized that immediately. When I did though, I couldn’t handle it. Because what is worse than knowing you want something, besides knowing you can never have it?

How could something, someone, my heart wants, be so close, but yet so impossibly far? I’ve known that it was impossible. I knew it could never happen. Ever. I know that only in the movies do protagonists finally get what their hearts’ desire, for the object of those desires to love them back. However, even when this happens in the movies, we are talking about straight, conventional romances. Not one involving one gay man and one straight man. Even though I know that, I can’t seem to stop the feelings. I’ve tried hard. I really did. I started dating. I tried to refocus my feelings on someone else. But it has been impossible. It is difficult when there is a dissonance between the heart and mind.

Some people have taken the liberty to regurgitate the all too familiar platitudes about  “getting over” someone. These people obviously don’t understand the complexity of my feelings if they think I could get over them so easily. Allowing these horrible feelings to bottle up inside me has taken quite a toll on me, feelings which leave me ruminating on your every word. Therefore a few weeks ago, I made the decision to do what was best for me. It might seem selfish, but I am trying my best in a terribly difficult situation.

Countless books have been written on homosexuality, tracing back almost to the beginning of mankind. I’ve read some of these books in search of answers, but none explained on how to fall in love with ones best friend and not completely ruin it. Maybe I was destined to forever fall in love with people I couldn’t have. Maybe there is a whole assortment of impossible people waiting for me to find them. People I will miss who aren’t mine to miss, people I will dream of who aren’t mine to dream about, people I will forever love who aren’t mine to love. Waiting to make me feel the same impossibility over and over again. Only time will tell whether I can ever have my friend back at some level and love him as just that: a friend.

I will remember our times together fondly. Our times at the office, the opening of our business, my 21st birthday, our late nights out with our friends, the drive back from the hookah bar followed by leftover subs at 4am on the night following the opening of our business. I apologize for having to do this in this manner, but I simply couldn’t find any other way for me to say everything that I need to say to at least have a chance at some sort of closure.

I wish you could forgive me for all the times I did or said something in an effort to attempt to keep my feelings to at least seem under control. I’m guilt-ridden and downhearted because I am, once again, placing an undue burden on someone who has never wronged me. I’m so fucking sorry. I hope that you understand why I feel that I must do this. I hope that you may one day forgive me for having caused all of this commotion in your life.""

He replied within 20 minutes, saying that he understands the situation and agrees with my solution. The part about thinking this was the right choice kind of took me back because at the end of the day, when a friend of yours tells you to GTFO your response shouldn't be ""I understand"". Anyways, he asked what to do about our friends, since we share 99% of our friends. I said I would no longer attend group events and that that since most were friends of his before they were my friends that he would keep all of them.

I'm glad things went smoothly, but now I find myself with almost no friends at all (except for 1 person), and trying to get over him... this is going to be a long process.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;After much thought, advice from you guys (Thanks!), and advice from people who are close to me I decided to break it off and send him an email.

So I met a guy online, we both want to explore our kinkier sides, me wanting to get more into the Dom top role, him wanting to explore his submissive side.

We have talked a lot about what we do and don't want to do, he has very few limitations, just doesn't want anal yet as he's new to beyond kissing and jerking with guys.

So my multi part questions are:

1. What are some kinky, dom/sub play we can do? We have already discussed how he is into feet worship, likes to call me daddy, wants me to chew food for him, water sports, and leading into the next question, restraints. But before we get into toys and gear, I am wondering what else we can get into/up to? I have been very mutual and vanilla about sex so far, so I always ask before/during sex ""hey wanna ____"" ad get a yes/no, he wants to be used like daddies little slut, but outside of foreplay and with the no anal yet agreement, I'm wondering what other realms we can discuss and explore?

2. Gear. I always kinda wanted to get into it, been looking for a chest harness, and ever since I saw this one trans kid at school wearing a neck collar.... mmmmm I wanted to lead my very own little boy around in one. I have looked up (googled) kink gear but the most prevalent review is that the product is good, but rings aren't soldered shut or leather cracks after a while. I am not asking for the most expensive or cheapest, maybe worst of the best kind of gear? He and I both want to explore bondage, so strapping him to the bed, cuffing him so he cant tough himself while we play, debating a spreader bar, but alas outside of googles top suggestions, I am clueless as to brands or sites worth purchasing from. So anyone with bondage/collar gear and advice is extremely welcome.  Mainly looking for collar and wrist ankle restraints, but also looking for how to strap him to hotel beds star fish style. Also open to any recommendations outside those two pieces, but just looking for starter pieces.


3. Lastly, ever since riding the bus and a bus boner + cute guy I was eye raping from the back of the bus, I had a part awakened in me. Never before was I more than vanilla and soft and slow and gentle sex, but him, I wanted to choke/hate fuck him. Respectfully of course. But since then I haven't been able to get the desire to choke a guy out of my head. The LAST thing I want to do is do any damage, but I haven't so much as gone beyond spanking. I mentioned it to him when we where going through our ""no judgements, just share the kinky stuff you wanna do/try"" and hes totally into it, but of all the stuff we wanna try together, this one can be dangerous. Anyone here have experience with choking their partners? I googled it and found some articles, but its mainly about experiences with it, not so much a how to guide. One recommended applying pressure to your own neck and find the sweet spots to apply pressure (did that, even gave myself a boner) but I'm just curious as to guys perspective who do the choking and who get it, what are tips/tricks, dos/don'ts and all that jazz. 

So yeah, feel free to chime in on anything you can help me out with or ad perspective too, and maybe if theres a better sub to ask kink questions

But before we get into toys and gear, I am wondering what else we can get into/up to? I have been very mutual and vanilla about sex so far, so I always ask before/during sex &amp;quot;hey wanna ____&amp;quot; ad get a yes/no, he wants to be used like daddies little slut, but outside of foreplay and with the no anal yet agreement, I&amp;#39;m wondering what other realms we can discuss and explore?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gear. I always kinda wanted to get into it, been looking for a chest harness, and ever since I saw this one trans kid at school wearing a neck collar.... mmmmm I wanted to lead my very own little boy around in one. I have looked up (googled) kink gear but the most prevalent review is that the product is good, but rings aren&amp;#39;t soldered shut or leather cracks after a while. I am not asking for the most expensive or cheapest, maybe worst of the best kind of gear? He and I both want to explore bondage, so strapping him to the bed, cuffing him so he cant tough himself while we play, debating a spreader bar, but alas outside of googles top suggestions, I am clueless as to brands or sites worth purchasing from. So anyone with bondage/collar gear and advice is extremely welcome.  Mainly looking for collar and wrist ankle restraints, but also looking for how to strap him to hotel beds star fish style. Also open to any recommendations outside those two pieces, but just looking for starter pieces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, ever since riding the bus and a bus boner + cute guy I was eye raping from the back of the bus, I had a part awakened in me. Never before was I more than vanilla and soft and slow and gentle sex, but him, I wanted to choke/hate fuck him. Respectfully of course. But since then I haven&amp;#39;t been able to get the desire to choke a guy out of my head. The LAST thing I want to do is do any damage, but I haven&amp;#39;t so much as gone beyond spanking. I mentioned it to him when we where going through our &amp;quot;no judgements, just share the kinky stuff you wanna do/try&amp;quot; and hes totally into it, but of all the stuff we wanna try together, this one can be dangerous. Anyone here have experience with choking their partners? I googled it and found some articles, but its mainly about experiences with it, not so much a how to guide. One recommended applying pressure to your own neck and find the sweet spots to apply pressure (did that, even gave myself a boner) but I&amp;#39;m just curious as to guys perspective who do the choking and who get it, what are tips/tricks, dos/don&amp;#39;ts and all that jazz. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah, feel free to chime in on anything you can help me out with or ad perspective too, and maybe if theres a better sub to ask kink questions &lt;/p&gt;

As with most STEM majors (and engineering particularly, it seems), there are not very many girls in my classes. My largest lecture has 72 students, and only 6 of them are girls, making it very hard to find a girl to talk to/hang with/date from class.

Now, since LGBT make up approximately 5% of the population (or 1 in 20 people is LGBT), I would expect at least a few other guys in my class to like dudes. I mean, in that same lecture there are 66 guys; I can't be the ONLY one. I've checked out the LGBT group (yes, singular) on campus, and I didn't feel like I could relate to any of the guys there. 

It seems all the gay guys here are into art, theater, english, or music... Don't get me wrong, I can appreciate those majors, but they aren't as... practical, intellectually demanding, or time intensive as STEM majors. I know some of you are going to hate me saying this, but almost all of these guys are feminine/""obviously gay"" as well (one even refers to himself as a spoiled princess -.-). I have yet to find a gay/bi guy here that, like myself and my straight friends in engineering, is into science/research, sports, being outside, or getting their hands dirty working on projects in the machine shop.

**So here are my questions:**

1. How many of you guys are involved in the STEM fields (engineering particularly)? 

2. I have read studies that while ""skill in mathematics"" is something you can work on and develop, it is mostly something you are born either able to understand or not. Males have also been seen to be better in math/science fields than women, who tend to focus on the humanities and arts. Since bisexual and homosexual male brains have some similar functions as straight female brains, could this possibly be an explanation for why gay dudes tend to prefer the arts over the sciences?

**This is more of a side comment:**

I was completely in the closet until last week. An alternative idea I have is that the gay/bi guys in my classes are also closeted. This could be because they, like me, have had a hard time accepting their sexuality since they are into ""masculine"" hobbies... Idk, I'm just finding it very hard to believe (statistically) that none of the other guys in my major are gay/bi.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;22 year old bisexual college guy here, studying Mechanical Engineering.
