When I'm in town, we live in my condo that we're living together ever since we were in college. He works as a software programmer at a very big company.

I arrived home from Portland a day earlier since the project's done pretty easily. When I came home, boyfriend was sleeping. He must be tired from all the overtime.

A knock was heard from my door just right before I poked him to wake him up. The knock made him awake. He was so stunned I was there. I smiled at him like a freak. He came nearer while the knock was consistent, I thought he was gonna hug me or kiss me. But he went straight to the door and insisted to open it instead.

But I'm the bigger and faster guy, so I headed to the door first. When I opened the door, a petit woman and somewhat like a toddler male appeared in front. I was puzzled.

""Is (Bf) there? You must be (Bf)'s brother."" I was surprised. We're out to basically everyone so why would he introduce me as a brother?

""Uhhh, you must be...?""

""This is your first time seeing your nephew! This is our son, and I'm just picking our baby up so we could celebrate our fourth wedding anniversary together""

I pieced out what was happening. I looked at him and he couldn't even return my stare.

We moved in together about 4 years ago. 3 years ago I started a business of my own (I'm in construction) and it's been taking off and doing really well/been very busy thank god. 

I have no issue, I'm happy and I have what I want: a nice house, money in the bank, stable relationship, growing business...all looks real good on paper.

However I am beginning to sense he is feeling discontented. 
I have gained some weight (a considerable amount: like 45lbs) from both eating a lot of fast food, not getting much excersize (I don't do much physical labor anymore, I hire people to do that since I'm the boss now) and also it runs in my family. He has not said anything and we still have a good sex life but I can tell he is turned off (he avoids putting hands certain places etc..) Obvious solution is diet/exercise but I'm not really motivated. I have no problem with how I look and I am confident in who I am, I'm not trying to be a model and I have much more important concerns than the fact that I'm getting a belly..
Also, although I love spending time with him anytime..in general in regards to other people outside my family (him and his parents included) I'm not really interested in hanging out with others...I Would much rather spend my time at home in my boxers chilling on the couch. He on the other hand has a desire to constantly have company over to hang out and have dinner and I just go upstairs and relax and watch tv when they're here.
He complains that I am rude but I have told him that I wouldn't be rude if he didn't constantly have people over when I just want to relax at home in my underwear (which is basically all of the time that I am at home and not working nowadays). I'm not really social and although I will gladly spend time with him or our families I have no desire to hang out with anyone else. He is welcome to do whatever he wants with his friends but I have always been anti social so I don't want to be included in it because I'm just not into it. I would rather spend my free time relaxing the having to put on nice clothes and ""entertain"" and hang out with people I have no desire to talk too anymore (they were both our friends growing up but I grew out of needing friends now that I am settled down)

Basically he is bothered that I am ""becoming an old man and letting myself go"" and that's true and I don't really mind it. I'm comfortable and happy, i have no desire to go to the gym and work out because IMO we are past the hot and heavy stage and looks arent that important...we all can't be hotties forever it's not like I'm 800 lbs peoples bodies age and I was never a ripped gym bunny to begin with, additionally I'm at the point where hanging out with the buddies seems pointless because we are a settled couple in our twenties and have each other. I don't mind spending time with him at all because I don't have to put on (maybe that's part of the problem) but with others I have to get dressed and act all proper and after a long day or a long week I don't want to do anything but hang out on the couch and order Chinese food...I'm just not social. He is and that's fine but I'm grown out of that phase and I'm happy to achieved the point in life where I can be a boring old man lol.


I'm afraid he is becoming discontented and happy, I treat him very well and we love each other very much but I don't want him to think I'm some lame ass and leave me, but at the same time I'm so happy to have gotten to the stage in my life where I have the security of a home and a business and can just be a boring old man who hangs out with his man on the couch eating take out and watching Netflix ya know?

I don&amp;#39;t mind spending time with him at all because I don&amp;#39;t have to put on (maybe that&amp;#39;s part of the problem) but with others I have to get dressed and act all proper and after a long day or a long week I don&amp;#39;t want to do anything but hang out on the couch and order Chinese food...I&amp;#39;m just not social. He is and that&amp;#39;s fine but I&amp;#39;m grown out of that phase and I&amp;#39;m happy to achieved the point in life where I can be a boring old man lol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m afraid he is becoming discontented and happy, I treat him very well and we love each other very much but I don&amp;#39;t want him to think I&amp;#39;m some lame ass and leave me, but at the same time I&amp;#39;m so happy to have gotten to the stage in my life where I have the security of a home and a business and can just be a boring old man who hangs out with his man on the couch eating take out and watching Netflix ya know? I have no desire to go back to being younger and going out and stuff &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some advice?&lt;/p&gt;

Also, TL;DR summary at the bottom.


About me:

I'm Bisexual (lets just say I'm not out the closet yet but the doors been wide open for a bit) and wondering if I absolutely need to come out-particularly to my family. I'm 23 and I grew up in a really diverse area in the East Coast, moved to a really conservative small midwestern town for college, and now that I've graduated I'm moving to Colorado this week. I contemplated coming out earlier but I pretty much figured it'd be so much easier if I just didn't in college. Being the first black person that many of  my classmates and friends had ever had a conversation with was extremely annoying since one of the favorite drunken pastimes of people I knew were asking me incredibly insightful questions like ""Why do all black people live in the ghetto?"" or looking at me and starting a conversation with ""Let me tell you what I think about Ferguson!"" I've had a few friends come out in college but while almost everyone was accepting and supportive to their face a lot of people had really ignorant comments and my friends started getting the same sort of ignorant questions and comments I got on a regular basis. So I decided not to volunteer to become a double minority. In addition before I came out to them a lot of my openly gay friends (and guys I meet on Grindr), whenever the topic of bisexuality came up would make comments like ""Bi people don't exist, they just want attention"" or ""That's what everyone says before they come out as gay."" It took me a really long time to come to terms with myself because I'm definitely attracted to women physically and I've fallen SUPER hard for 2 girls in my life emotionally but only found a physical attraction to guys so far. It wasn't until I was older that I realized the physical thing is probably because I live in the middle of nowhere where I have almost no options... and I'm black.


Where I'm at now with it:

Now that I'm moving I'm kind of on the fence as to if I should do it. My future roommate there already knows I'm bi and is totally cool with it. I know very few people in the area so just introducing myself as being bi I think will be super easy and I won't have to put all the effort into it. And all of my college friends that I actually plan on keeping in contact with either already know, or I know they're feelings towards me wouldn't change. My mother however is the one I'm concerned about. My mom turns 60 this year. She's had a few gay friends in her life and has been loving and supporting of all of them. (Like in the 80's and 90's- post/during the AIDS Crisis before that shit was cool) including helping a friend of hers coming to term with her son being gay. However because she was born in the 50's she has some really really backwards views ingrained in her.



Hilarious Anecdotes about my mothers homophobia:

1) There is a lesbian that goes to our church. We all decided to go out to brunch afterwards but she had to run some errands first. Getting to the restaurant early this conversation happened

Me: Since she's not here, I guess I'll put in a table for 3.

Mom: No, you'll need a table for 4

Me: Who's the extra person

Mom: You know she's going to bring her boyfriend with her

Me: ...? ""K"" is a lesbian... she has a girlfriend... that's why they're lesbian

Mom: No. Every relationship has a boy and a girl. ""K"" is the girl, ""T"" is the man. That's just how it works!

No amount of reason could convince her otherwise.

2) She still uses the word ""fairies"" to describe gay men (to be fair- my great grandma still uses the word Negro to describe herself and others in conversation, and often asks if I still feel safe living next to mexicans and white people).

3) That friend she helped get over her son being gay she pretty much told him ""He may be a fairy, but that's your only son. He loves you and he needs you the most right now. Besides, you never know, it could just be a phase."" Two years later- he is back in the closet.

4) Her biggest fear is that I'll be a victim of a hate crime. No joke she has told me multiple times in reference to her friends gay son. ""I'd rather you be gay than marry a white woman.""



More about me and my moms relationship:

It's always just been me and her growing up. She worked 2 jobs through diagnosed with Cancer, Lupus, and a job injury that almost left us homeless, just to make sure I had every opportunity that she never had. We talk just about every day. She tells me all the time ""I'm so glad we have that relationship where we can talk about everything"" but it's kind of been one sided since my teenage years because she worries about everything.



My concerns:

Unlike most people my biggest fear isn't rejection, I know she loves me and will always be there for me. I just don't want to have to deal with a constant barrage of ridiculous questions and comments. I know they would be coming from a place of pure innocence and ignorance but it would get old fast. And theres no changing her mind on anything- ever. I also don't want to come out to her, end up meeting the girl of my dreams 2 years later, and reinforcing the idea that ""being gay is a phase some guys go through"" for her. Also, if I end up marrying a girl anyway I'd rather not have to deal with my mom in the first place.



Am I being stupid or should I just nut up and do it?

I replied by saying I've yet to feel a single arrousing feeling towards any girl.

(My boyfriend is 26) . . Everything for the past year has been amazing, and we have been crazy about each other since the day we met. He is not out of the closet except to his one cousin and a girl who lives in another country (Convenient?) - - and I never thought this would bother me.

I never thought I would care, but I totally do. 
This last month, a total 180 occurred in our relationship, and it has been on a total downward spiral. We haven't slept together in like 3 weeks, saw each other maybe for two hours last week, yet if I bring anything up, he thinks I am just being ""dramatic."" My feelings have seemed to turn for him in the matter of weeks, and I think it is because I just do not see a light at the end of the tunnel? He promises and swears he is working on it, and that he is going to tell his friends, but here we are...a year in, and he ""swears"" he is going to tell ""his best friend in February."" I love him, I really do, and it seems like it would hurt to see him with anyone else, however, I do not know how much more I can take of being a secret.
Further, his job is mediocre, he says he is going to look for a new one, and he is just generally a totally laid back person, one of those who likes to sleep 12 hours, until 3pm if he can every day. I, on the other hand, am on the go 24/7, am full of energy, and feel that missing sleep is missing something that could happen, have a bright future ahead of me, am attractive (everyone always says how much better looking I am than him..)...Are these two separate “ways of life” incompatible?
I’m stuck in this situation, we are always fighting about him not being out, his laziness, his need for a new job, not seeing each other just over this past month...Does this determine what the rest of our relationship is going to be like? I love him but I do not know where to go from here...any advice on my situation? Is there a light at the end of the tunnel?

They idealize this other person or maybe see (consciously or unconsciously) them in an unrealistic light in order to fit whatever ""perfect partner mold"" they may have constructed in their mind. Maybe the person is a pretty close fit, so there's not necessarily too much wishful thinking or ignoring of reality going on all the time, but it obviously takes a lot of time to truly know another person to their core and how they will react in multiple settings.

Even though I'm aware this type of thing occurs all the time, I know I'm still vulnerable to my thoughts running all over the place. I'd say we all probably are to some extent. But I guess I hope that by being conscious about it and acknowledging that I could very well be missing stuff is the best and most realistic thing I can do to mitigate any ""harm"" that could come from it. All that said, going through various relationships here and there, some very short-term, others longer and more serious, has taught me a lot about my own behavior (how I react/respond to stuff), and I've gotten pretty good at knowing if I like a guy or could at least see things going somewhere.

Three weeks ago, I started talking to a guy on Grindr of all places (I know, I know) and from the get-go the interaction was different. Now on Grindr, not saying ""sup? wanna hook up?"" is enough to be 'different,' but in this case we actually had a pretty decent conversation and both expressed interest in maybe finding someone to get to know, see where things go, and possibly date. We've hung out maybe ~7 times or so, ranging from sitting around drinking beer and talking around a bonfire and making s'mores, to going to dinner/movies, to seeing a comedy show together, to going to an indoor rock climbing gym, to walking around a park. Those are the big ones that stick out at least. In other words, we've spent a decent amount of time interacting and getting to know each other in a variety of settings. 

Through all of that, we've had some pretty awesome, and at times really intense, conversations. It's all flowed naturally, we have a lot of similar interests, our senses of humor mesh, he's really fun to hang out with, and thus far, we both seem to have similar outlooks on things like dating, family life, religion, communication, etc. Without good conversation, I get bored with people pretty fast, so from the start, I was pretty impressed with this guy. The only ""downside"" I could think of so far is how we both acknowledged we're very career-focused and have had the tendency in the past to neglect some parts of our personal lives as a result. 

When you take all of that and add in how attractive I find him and how great the sexual chemistry is, I can't help but sit here like a giddy school~~girl~~*boy* just like ""oh wow, this is awesome."" It's been a long time (i.e. probably hasn't ever happened) that I've clicked this well with someone on so many levels this soon into a relationship, although at this point it is still casual dating/talking.

**My question, I guess, is given situations and scenarios like this, how do you appropriately ""pace"" yourself with the relationship? Is there even a way to judge what's too fast/too slow?**

I've seen things crash and burn with friends before when they've moved too fast too soon, and I know I ultimately can't control the outcome anyhow, but given the awesomeness in this situation, I want to make sure I don't get caught up in everything and rush things.

Problem is, that he&amp;#39;s very fragile (emotionally) and has a history of severe depression… I&amp;#39;m afraid that when I say that I&amp;#39;m in a relationship, he will harm himself. I&amp;#39;m very sympathetic about his situation. Have you guys been in something similar? If so, what did you guys say and how did he react? Any help will be great! Thanks bros &lt;/p&gt;

TL;DR at the bottom 
I am a 16 year old high school student who has recently been fighitng some depression. I don't go to a therpist, instead I just kind of handle it on my own in copious ways. Ever since I found this subreddit, I've become a lot more comfortable with my sexual identity and plan to come out when I'm 18 and can leave this shithole we call high school. That being said, I am still completely in the closet; most everyone assumes me completely straight as I have hooked up with girls that they know of. I've also hooked up with one guy. He's 'straight' (as far as everyone else is concerned) and I hated it but now I crave something more, something real. I've already accepted the fact that I can't have a relationship until I'm 18 for a couple reasons. One reason is because I truly am into older guys, not that I would reject someone around my age, but naturally I just am. Most people who meet me for the first time automatically assume I'm in my mid 20's, and not just because I look older. Second, I really am only romatically attracted to guys who are very masculine. I don't mean to sound like an asshole, because I have two feminine gay friends who I am friends with, I just don't ever see myself with them sexually or romatically. My question is, how do I fight these lonely feelings? I fear that even when I get to college I won't meet people. I see posts on here all the time about young guys (18,19, 20 y/o) complaining that they can't meet anyone worth while. Is this true? I've even psyched myself out so much from these feelings of lonliness that I would rather decide on a college that has a large GayBro community (which would be impossible to find a statistic for) than one that has sufficent academics.

Right from the outset, he was honest with me about not being a fan at all of monogamous relationships. OK, that's cool, I've felt for a while that, under the right circumstances, I could make that work and, indeed, it seemed pretty fun.

Well, partly, yeah, it has been pretty fun. I can go to the bathhouse once a week just like I did when I was single, and we've had some great 3- &amp; 4-ways. He goes to the baths a few times a week (his sex drive is higher than mine), and I'm totally cool with that. We've gone to the baths together (on NYE!), and one time we even ran into each other when we went separately! That was fun.

But he also has a couple of FWB's, and this is where the problem comes in. I'm cool with him having a guy over that he just has sex with, but it's more than that. He has guys sleep over, and he *does* develop some feelings for these guys.

Now, in my head, I'm cool with the idea that love isn't a finite quantity, and that just because he might have feelings for another guy he's seeing, it doesn't mean he loves me any less. I get that. But it seems like my heart doesn't get it. Whenever he spends the night with another guy, I feel awful, like I start wondering if I mean anything to him, even though I know in my head that I do.

I've read up on open relationships, and one thing I've read is that, yes, these feelings happen, and you just have to deal with it. Well, I don't know if I can. It's weird, it's not jealousy over him having sex with another guy, it's more that I'm being made to make a little room for this other person, and I've come to realize that I don't like doing that.

As I said, we've only been dating a little over 6 months. I'm wondering if the relationship is even at a point where I can ask for things to be negotiated, like no sleepovers, or no fwb's.

I'm hoping that, over time, these feelings will go away, because I love this guy very much, and I'd like for him to be the person I grow old with.

So, for guys in open relationships, did you or do you have these feelings when your man gets with another man? How do you deal with them? Did they go away over time?

I am having major trust issues with my BF.  We have been together a number of years, and early on the in the relationship I caught him cheating on me more than once.  Somehow we worked things out and moved on.  I now believe he is cheating on me again, probably has been for all this time, at least that is what I think, and that is the issue, that I believe he is cheating on me.

I recently found very strong evidence of this, but not 100% sure.  I catch him lying to me about where he has been or doing, and also lying about transgressions in the past that I know about, but he doesn't know I know.  I sometimes feel I am creating things in my mind and it all boils down to a trust issue.  I am almost looking for signs or proof he is cheating on me.  Right now I don't trust him, but I want to.

We have talked about how I feel (him cheating) in the past and he assures me he is not cheating on me, nor would he.  He gets upset if I bring up how I feel about the subject and makes me feel bad by telling me how awful I am for thinking such things.  I can't outright say I know he is lying because I have this proof or that proof, for my own reasons.

It boils down to a trust issue, but if I confront him with what I know, he would deny it anyways or come up with this excuse or that reason. If I continue like this, my head will explode. I want to trust him, and I want things to work out, but if I force the issue, and we stay together, I know I still won't be able to trust him because it was me that forced the issue.  I need him to come clean on his own, put all the cards on the table and see if we want to stay together and to work things out and be truly honest with each other.  I feel that by him coming clean to me, he will 'prove' he is being honest with me, and I guess that is all I am looking for.  If we can work it out, which I believe we would (but it would be hard), then I feel I could trust him again.  

Each relationship is different and you have to be willing to consider many factors (which there are in ours), so please don;t judge me for wanting to stay with him.  I'm not looking for 'dump the cheating ass' advice, so please don't post that, and please don't judge me for wanting things to work out between us.  He is a great guy and I truly love him and believe he loves me.  He sees cheating as getting off, nothing more and attaches no feelings to it, so for him, it is no big deal as long as he doesn't get caught.

How do I get him to come clean?

What do I do if he doesn't?

I'm 25 (almost 26) and have had two other LTRs. Both lasted about two years each, and both were very hard break ups (the second perhaps more than the first. Point being, I have experience). Now, I will say this definitively: my current guy is the man I want to marry and raise a family with. He is literally perfect for me, and I'm confident he feels the same way. Some will say that's fast, but it's something that I genuinely trust myself (and him) to feel and understand.

I've been on my career path (science research) since my junior year of college (four years now). I just found out this morning that I got into a PhD program that is top 5 in the country for my field. I went for my interview last weekend, and the program is a perfect fit for me: cutting-edge research, respected faculty, a young but up-and-coming advisor, everything. The only problem is that it's on the other side of the US (we're east coast, the school is in California). My guy has an amazing job, plus all his friends and family, within 30 minutes of where he lives now, and I would never ask him to leave that this soon into a relationship (I'd be moving at the end of the summer).

I haven't yet told him I've been accepted, as first I'd like to think through it. But we've had a number of conversations about how we would deal with each possible outcome. Obviously, if I stay, we will continue dating and I will get to have my dream guy. Similarly, if I stay, I will do one more year of full-time research and publish my first first-author paper (a big deal pre-doctoral): this will make my chances of getting into more (possibly even better) programs next year even higher. However, if I stay (thus turning down their offer), I will not be able to reapply to this program next year. Also, my boss may find it odd/unsettling that I got into such an amazing program and turned it down. If I go, I will get to start my PhD journey earlier, join a massively high-quality group of researchers, and I will be living in a new and exciting place. However, I will lose him, and even thinking about that makes me want to cry. I know I would be miserable for a long time, and likely regret it for even longer.

I've asked a couple of questions here before and I know the answer is generally ""do what feels right."" Really, I'm wondering if anyone has had a similar experience? And if not, just some outside advice would be appreciated. Thanks, fellas.

So, around 10 months ago, after being engaged to a man for nearly a year, I found out he had been cheating and using me the whole time, and thus the relationship ended. I'm fairly sure I'm over that part, that chapter of my life is long over. But, my sex drive has never really bounced back, and that kind of concerns me.

While I was with my ex, my sex drive was **very** high. I was ready to go at a moment's notice, and had to masturbate frequently (2 or 3 times a day) whenever him and I were apart any length of time, just to keep up with it. When the truth came out and things ended, I felt betrayed, and honestly, *disgusted*. I had no interest in sex for the first couple months. 

But I always assumed it would bounce back, after all, I'm a 20 year-old man. I haven't done anything sexual with a guy since the breakup 10 months ago, and any times that things came close to that, I was always hit with this feeling of disgust. Any talk of anything sexual repulses me, which is very much out-of-character for me. I try to hide it, but it still prevents me from actually being sexual with anyone.

Lately, it's even worse. Like, anytime I have even a passing sexual thought, I'm just hit with this feeling of complete repulsion, and have this thought in the back of my mind of ""Eww, I'm disgusting, I'm no better than him (my ex) if I want this. This is disgusting. Everyone has STDs. I could never trust anyone with my body like that."" I know that it's not true, and that it's irrational, but I can't seem to stop myself from feeling these feelings and having these thoughts.

The messed up part is that deep-down, I know that I'm the type of person who loves sexual intimacy and need it in my life in some capacity. But yet I'm so repulsed by the idea lately, and even if I get close enough to someone, I end up changing my mind... I just can't win. I'm so wary of everyone, and I feel silly just typing it, but it's the best word for it.

We used to be crazy about each other, and while I still am, I'm not sure at all that he's reciprocating. He avoids kissing me, he turns away and doesn't let me touch him sometimes.

Previously 3 could be our daily number.

I've asked what's wrong and he won't say a peep. I ask continusly, he gets mad and asks me why ""I'm a bitch""? And it usually ends in him going, ""Oh, it's nothing."".

He had Grindr installed the night I came over and I didn't bother. One night he was messaging with someone and I asked ""who are you writing with?"" lightly. ""Nobody, people keeps sending me dickpics"". Okay, so we had a discussion and it ended with him deleting it, but against my saying. I told him I trusted him to have it installed. But no.

So what my point is, why the fuck do I do? I don't feel right snooping. But if he can't tell me straight, what is the point... 

I can't help but feel he's on the brink of calling it quits. But then the other second he talks about our future children, like ""awww, I want to raise babies with you blablabla"".
