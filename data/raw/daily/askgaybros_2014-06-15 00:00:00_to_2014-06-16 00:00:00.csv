We blew each other while watching porn and it was great, it didn't affect our friendship nor did it change anything.

We would just hang out as per usual, and when we were alone we would blow each other. It was amazing, thinking about it gets me hard.

Now the thing is that friend moved to a different country and I have no one.

I love giving and getting blowjobs but I'm not attracted to men.

The idea of sucking dick, having a warm load shot into my mouth is the second hottest thing I can think of. But I don't like dudes.


So I've been watching a lot of shemale porn which is great but I still physically WANT it.

As a solution I've looked at online websites like craigslist for a hookup, but everytime I see pics of those dudes I'm not attracted to them, I'm repulsed even.

So idk, there is is.

In my years I've learned that sexuality is not black and white, and I don't care about titles such as bi-sexual or gay or straight.

I'm a bibro and this is my first post, but I've been lurking for about 2 months. I have 4 questions in this post. 

Okay, so my mind is racing, but I guess I'll start with some background information. I (Zephyr) am 21 and I've had sexual encounters with both sexes before, but I've only been in relationships with women until now. When I began perusing gaybros I thought I was physically attracted to both sexes, but only romantically attracted to women. Because of the amazing stories I read on gaybros and the fact that my last two relationships were disasters, I decided that I would open myself up to the possibilities of relationships with men. About my last two relationships: in the first I was drugged with Xanax and raped while blackout. In the second I received HPV from my girlfriend, although she was unaware she had the virus because she wasn't showing symptoms. Both fell apart shortly after. 

Anyway, I'm in my home state for the summer until school starts again and I get on Grindr, Jack'd, Scruff and Adam4Adam and changed my profiles to indicate that I was interested in dating and a possible long term relationship instead of the typical hookups. It doesn't take long before I'm talking to a guy we'll call B. He's 19, gay, and I met him on Adam4Adam of all places. We start texting for about a week and we're getting along great. I had no particular goal in mind and I learn that he works on a farm near by hometown and knows how to weld. That sounds intriguing and I ask B if he would be able to teach me. He finds that enthralling, his words, and we really start to hit it off. 

Our first meetup falls through because I get called into work at the last minute, but we continue to text. Shortly after this I confess to him that I have HPV and I tell B it's alright if he doesn't want to meet me or hangout. He says, ""please don't think I'm so shallow that I wouldn't talk to or date someone just because of an STD"". Mind. Blown. So we plan a second meetup at an A&amp;W. This one goes perfectly and afterwards we drive down some backroads in my truck and he shows me all his family's properties and farmland. At this point I would like to point out that we're both closeted because we live in small, rural, conservative towns. He directs me to a secluded spot off the roads and we park there and talk for about an hour. I'm playing music the whole time and telling him about the music festivals I attend and we slowly move closer to each other until I have my arm around him. I start telling him about one of my favorite artists, Above &amp; Beyond, and that their live shows always bring me to tears. Above &amp; Beyond communicate to the crowd by typing messages on their screen and I tell B about the time they display the quote, ""You can't measure love with distance"". This quote gets to me because of how often I travel, but without missing a beat or letting me finish the story he says, ""that's because you measure love with this"" and he kisses me deeply. We stop, stare at each other, and then proceed to spend the next three hours holding each other, cuddling, making out and talking. 

We plan a trip for 4 days later to see a theatre performance of Les Miserable in Canada, which is about 45 minutes from where we live. During the performance we hold hands and B leans on my shoulder. We hang out in Canada a bit afterwards until we head back over the border to our hotel. We get there and almost immediately we're all over each other. We planned on taking a shower together but it takes 45 minutes because every time we got off the bed to get in there we'd start making out and fall back on the bed. Eventually we get to the shower by making out and walking there at the same time. We spend the next 3 hours in a sexual marathon (with protection) in and out of the shower. I bottomed for the first time, I'd only topped when I hooked up, and we flip for each other. We're talking the whole time and it feels incredibly comfortable and natural. Eventually we fall asleep tangled in each others limbs. We wake up, eat the continental breakfast, come back and spoon and sleep more for a few hours. It was magic and after we wake up we agree that we want to be in an exclusive committed relationship. That was yesterday. 

Now that I have that off my chest, I have some fears that I'm hoping you gaybros can assuage. 

1. B's family is hyper religious and he's waiting to come out to them until he's financially independent. I, on the other hand, could come out to my parents and although it would initially be awkward, I could immediately start bringing B over and introduce him to my family. The thing is, I don't feel ready. Before Gaybros I thought I would stay closeted forever. This experience has nudged me even closer to coming out, but I'm not there yet. The only way we can meet in private is hotels and we can't afford that often. Am I being selfish?

2. B is going to get vaccinated for HPV, but the process takes some time and in the mean time we plan on using protection and being as safe as possible. He said that he wants to do everything he can to prevent himself from receiving HPV, but says he would be okay with getting it if that happened. This really bothered me. I want him to be happy and I don't want to feel responsible for inflicting a disease on B. Do you guys have any advice about this?

3. We have all summer to be together, but come fall I have to return to my school that is a 19 hour drive away. We've already discussed this and we want to make things work despite the distance. I'll be back every holiday and maybe once or twice besides if I can get the money together for plane tickets. I've never been in a long distance and I was wondering if you guys had any advice how to make it work? Am I being Naive? 

4. Finally, do you guys have any tips in general about being in a same sex relationship? In a lot of ways it's similar to being in a relationship with a women, but it's different in others. So far the relationship with B feels remarkably free because I don't feel any gender expectations to be masculine. I feel more free to be myself and I don't feel I need to fit myself into society's mold of what a man in a relationship should be.

Away with my friends all week at the beach, everyones hooking up except me (because im gay and they are not) and so I was on grindr a lot during the week looking for guys or whatever. So I was talking to this one guy over the week and it didnt work out and then I got a message from another guy seeing what was up. It turned out he was our neighbor, like right next door and I really wanted to do something. So within like 15 minutes of talking I go next door and have some coffee with him. I'm really nervous at this point because I've never hooked up with someone like at all before. Another important thing is that I'm 18 and he was around 40.....which honestly I dont mind at all because he was hot and safe and open. So we go upstairs and starting kissing and everything, and then were naked and I'm sucking his dick (it was amazing) but because I was so nervous and new to that type of thing I had a hard time actually getting hard, but he sucked me off despite me being not completely hard. He finished on my ass and I came in his mouth, and then I left. 

So questions: When you first hooked up with someone were you nervous and shy about getting hard?

Also is there any risk if he just came on my ass, and not in it? IK that may sound dumb but I'm new to this kind of stuff.

And finally is that age difference weird? It really didnt bother me at all especially since he was attractive.

I am 21, I look young and I hate it. I have always found people in their 30s-40s more attractive. Every time I look into the mirror I feel like a little boy and I don't find it attractive at all.

I hated how young I look last time, so some friends told me I should probably hit the gym and fill in some mass so that I would look older. So I did that. And yeah, now I am in good shape. But there is no gym for the face; I still look disgustingly young.

A good comparison would be Justin Bieber. He is 20, also relatively in shape, but his face looks just like a child.

I have been rejected in gay bars, apps and OKCupid just because I look young, and it's a big blow on my self confidence. They would usually go ""you have a hot body, but you look like you just finished high school"". And those who are attracted to me would be the weird creeps who are exclusively into young boys.

I know this ""I can't wait to be old"" mentality is childish and stupid but sometimes I can't help but think that maybe if I look 5 years older I'll be more attractive that what I am now.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I understand that everyone will have their own dose of body dysmorphia.&lt;/p&gt;
