This is my first post here, but I come seeking some advice!
I'm sixteen years old, half-way through, and have personally began to accept the fact that I'm gay. I went through the ""curious"" to the ""bisexual"" to the ""asexual"" to the whatever cop-out I could, but after a few years, it's just reality. That's all good and fine.

However, I've never been the romantic type. Any relationship I had attempted before (with girls and guys alike) has been stale, forced, and ultimately pointless; peer pressure and all that. But recently, I've found myself falling for a guy in a way that I never really have before. Thinking of him makes me happy, in a simple way. :)

He's told me before, off-handedly, that he's bisexual. I think he may be like me, doubting himself, but I'm not sure. I've hung out with him a few times, occasionally at school, but he's not really in my social circle, so it's not regular- But for the past month or two, we've been texting each other, and while neither of us have ever mentioned feelings for one another, there's hints.

The issue is, we're both super fucking awkward and introverted (sorry for being that teenager stereotype, but it's true), him more-so than I. He's never been very social, and a lot of people find him unattractive physically (I disagree, personally), and he's never been in a proper relationship- his self-esteem is pretty low, so there's no way he'd openly show proper signs of really feeling the same way.

I'm not sure how he feels, and I'm scared to ask. I'm worried that it's not fair to assume that I DO have feelings for him because we only really text, and don't hang out a lot. But we talk about everything, and he's witty, and he's more open with me than most people, I feel like, and he's just great, in my eyes. I'm smitten, for the first time in a long time. :)

But I don't know how to really take it to that next level (whatever that level may be without potentially scaring him off. Any help?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey, Bros- &lt;/p&gt;

I need your help!
Been with this pretty amazing man for 4 ish months. I know not very long or anything. I go out of town a lot for this internship (5-6days away, 4 home) and think about him a lot. I look forward to texting him from the hotel at night and he crosses my mind relatively often throughout the day (which I think is a great thing, RIGHT?). I’d like to think this is a healthy mind set to be at this point, and especially when I am away and relatively lonely it’s a warming thought to be going home to him at the end of the trip. 

 When we first started dating I was pretty conscious of how often I texted him while I was away- I didn’t want our relationship to be all text; so kept it to one conversation a day kind of thing. 

I’ve been noticing a trend and it’s starting to eat away at me. Not sure if I’m being rational. 

Essentially, he seldomly initiates the texting and/or meeting up when I am in town. I don’t know if this is because he is (gasp) less interested in me or if it’s just the roles we’ve kind of fallen into (I text, he replies)? I feel like a 14 year old girl but it makes me feel like he might not be thinking about me when I am away and I guess I am insecure about that. 

I only have one other long term (2 year) relationship to base this off of- and in that one we basically were in a constant text chat all the time, called daily and whatnot (I wanted to avoid this overkill, so that’s why I tried to hold back on the texting). I am not saying this is normal (is it?) but I really don’t know what I should be calling normal this early in the relationship?

As always thank you for your advice.

I had a really great friend who I used to have over twice a week for hang time and every couple weeks I would go out with him and his clique. Then for reasons of busyness our hangs died down to a couple times a month and I stopped being invited out with his clique altogether. 
Cut to a year later and we haven't hung for a good couple months, which both of us are upset by. So we actually come up with a strategy to hang more and plan a couple weekends worth of stuff to happen in the coming weeks. He forgets to turn up or has to work through all of these things. One of them that really bugged me was his girlfriend was going away for a whole week so he had all his evenings and the weekend to hang. Then out of the blue he had to work all that week in the other side of the country, not back until late Friday night. That Friday night he got back at about midnight and was out with his clique and was so hung over we didn't hang that weekend. This really annoyed me so we had a heart to heart where I ask why I was dropped from his clique and he confessed that while his friends 'really liked me' he felt that there wasn't that group dynamic when I was there. At the end of this talk (which I felt humiliated for just bring up) we vowed to make an effort to see each other more.
So a year later and nothing really changed. We had a few dinners with partners (belurgh) and he invited me out to the movies with him whenever his girlfriend didn't want to go. We are not hang friends at all any more.
A couple months ago I was helping him move house. Technically I was helping his girlfriend move because he had to emergency work, and, interestingly for me, the two major players in his clique also turned up to help. After the move his girlfriend treated the four of us to lunch and as we finished up one of the clique started to work out what they should all get up to that night to celebrate moving in. They did this while I sat there. I was not involved or even thrown some eye contact as these three people who I used to hang with, and just spent the whole day working with, planned a party that I was not invited to. I felt so low at that point. I can't imagine a scenario where I wouldn't even throw an empty 'Oh you are invited too"" to someone I didn't  like to save my own embarrassment. But that was not a problem for either of the three of them. I learned from that moment that not only was I not 'really liked' by these people, nor was I even disliked, I was a non-entity to them. And these are the people my friend spends 10:1 of his time with compared to me.
I realise now I have become a 'private friend' in this guys life, and because I am explicitly excluded from his social life, it is never going to get better. I have friends who I think of as 'stable friends', friends you might call on to go see Transformers III or call on to make up a 5-a-side football team, but they are not hang-time friends. I don't want to be a stable friend to this guy.

TLDR
So what do I do. My friend is tied to a clique that I am excluded from. I can see fairly regularly *if* I host the hang-time, but I know that the should I slow down on it I won't see him any more. I think his friendship must mean a lot to me because I get a tummy ache thinking about it. And on the couple times I've slighted him he's told me it hurt, so I'm confident he likes me just as much too. 

Will I be happier to break it off and have that regret, or just continue to let this idle friendship limp on forever?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Has anyone had to seriously break up a friendship with someone when neither you nor the friend in question had actually done something wrong?&lt;/p&gt;

To those who don't like personal stories/complaints, stop reading now and feel free to downvote. This is just something that I feel I can ask you guys about and get advice from an unbiased third-party.

I dated this guy for about a year. Let's call him G. I started seeing him the beginning of my sophomore year at college. A couple weeks into a semi-official monogamous relationship, I got black-out one night and cheated, something I never saw myself, or see myself ever again, doing. A month later, he found out. We had a rough patch after that but we managed to work it out.

Around the springtime, about 6 months in, I start getting messages from guys on skype. It started out as a ""friend"" of mine asking if I could help him discover if a guy he had a crush on was gay or not. I put friend in quotations because the skype username used the full name of an old friend of mine whom I hadn't talked to in a while.

Basically, this sends me down a rabbit hole. Guy 1 references me to Guy 2, Guy 2 to Guy 3 etc. All of these guys, by the pictures they send me, are stupid attractive. Like...9/10, 10/10. They flirt, I'm flattered but keep on insisting that I am taken. They are persistent. They claim to know G, my bf. They say he wants a threesome, and that they want in. Either that, or they reference me to the next guy.
This goes on for a while. Eventually G and I break up. Mostly from pressure by his friends who hate me, and also for personal reasons.

But these guys keep on messaging me. And no longer only on skype, but on Grindr (which I redownloaded a couple months after I became single) as well.

I start to see a pattern. Super hot guys who message me, flirt, who's cams are ""broken"" and phone's are too cheap to have any apps, too busy to take calls.

I realize it: I am being catfished. And not only a random catfish, but a huge thought-out catfishing operation.
They all have the same MO: ask the same stuff in the same way, use the same emoticons, have the same excuses, talk about threesomes.

On grindr you can see how far someone is right? At school they are all, every single one, 1 mile away. G, my ex, lives 1 mile away. He works in DC every other day. On those days, he is 49 miles away. Every single account is then 49 miles away.

Now, I would not give a duck's shit about this if it were not for the fact that it has been going on for over a year now. I barely use grindr, and its usually for shits and gigs, but whichever profile is in use at the time always messages me. Attractive guys. Makes you feel good. When they're fake, dampens your confidence a bit.

And, not to mention, he/they have been sending around pictures of myself, private pictures I had only sent to my ex, to other guys on grindr. Saying I am dtf and want a threesome. There is more stuff/proof out there but I can't think of it at the top of my head at the moment.

So...advice? I want to confront him. This is fucked up. But should I waste my time? Is it worth the confrontation?

He is in a lot of pain when he moves and finds it really hard to change the dressing. I'm hoping someone who has been through it can give us some advice.

* How long does the pain/discomfort last?

* Any tips on washing it and changing the dressing?

* How long until the hypersensitivity goes away?

* How do you deal with the hypersensitivity?

He's also concerned about what it will look like.

* How did yours turn out?

* Does it look the same as someone who was circumcised when they were young?

* How long does it take before it looks normal?

* Any other general advice?

Potentially great guys never show enough interest to make me think that I have a chance and should pursue them, and instead remain ""cool"" and ""aloof"" (ie. a bit distant and emotionally unavailable, because that's what's ""cool"" right now...). Guys that later turn out to be crazy/manipulative/abusive are the only ones who ever seem interested enough in me, so I usually end up wasting my time with them. 

I realize that dating requires effort, and fostering great connections takes time, but I'm sick of feeling like I'm always chasing guys that don't want me, or like I'm always having to try and prove myself so that they'll maybe see me as worthy of getting involved with. I'm tired of all the ""good"" guys being so closed-off and distant, so as to seem uninterested, and having to be suspicious of anyone who seems genuinely interested in me, because they always turn out to be really toxic people. And I hate saying it like that, because I know it sounds like I'm being dramatic or that I'm victimizing myself, even though that's not what's going on (well, I might be a tad dramatic, but it's no exaggeration when I say that every guy that I've been on more than one date with has mistreated me, and the ones who didn't get that far just lost interest or never had it in the first place, or never called back, etc. etc.).

I don't wanna have to try so hard to get people to like me, because I know it doesn't work that way, but at the same time I also realize that some effort is necessary. I'm just fucking tired of wanting something I can't have, of waiting for someone that clearly doesn't fucking exist.

I just wish all the good guys didn't either hide from me, or simply weren't interested in me. I'm tired of feeling like I'm the only one ever putting in any effort. I'm done with wasting time and being let down. But what the fuck can I even do about it?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m just so fed up with the current dating environment. Potentially great guys never show enough interest to make me think that I have a chance and should pursue them, and instead remain &amp;quot;cool&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;aloof&amp;quot; (ie. a bit distant and emotionally unavailable, because that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;cool&amp;quot; right now...). Guys that later turn out to be crazy/manipulative/abusive are the only ones who ever seem interested enough in me, so I usually end up wasting my time with them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realize that dating requires effort, and fostering great connections takes time, but I&amp;#39;m sick of feeling like I&amp;#39;m always chasing guys that don&amp;#39;t want me, or like I&amp;#39;m always having to try and prove myself so that they&amp;#39;ll maybe see me as worthy of getting involved with. I&amp;#39;m tired of all the &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; guys being so closed-off and distant, so as to seem uninterested, and having to be suspicious of anyone who seems genuinely interested in me, because they always turn out to be really toxic people. And I hate saying it like that, because I know it sounds like I&amp;#39;m being dramatic or that I&amp;#39;m victimizing myself, even though that&amp;#39;s not what&amp;#39;s going on (well, I might be a tad dramatic, but it&amp;#39;s no exaggeration when I say that every guy that I&amp;#39;ve been on more than one date with has mistreated me, and the ones who didn&amp;#39;t get that far just lost interest or never had it in the first place, or never called back, etc. etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t wanna have to try so hard to get people to like me, because I know it doesn&amp;#39;t work that way, but at the same time I also realize that some effort is necessary. I&amp;#39;m just fucking tired of wanting something I can&amp;#39;t have, of waiting for someone that clearly doesn&amp;#39;t fucking exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just wish all the good guys didn&amp;#39;t either hide from me, or simply weren&amp;#39;t interested in me. I&amp;#39;m tired of feeling like I&amp;#39;m the only one ever putting in any effort. I&amp;#39;m done with wasting time and being let down. But what the fuck can I even do about it?&lt;/p&gt;
