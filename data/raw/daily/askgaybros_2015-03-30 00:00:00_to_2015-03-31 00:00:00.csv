So I came out to Mom after I found out that my younger brother came out to her. She kind of forced me into it by saying, ""Well I would have thought you would have a lot to say about that."" So I just kind of said, ""I know how he feels because I feel the same way."" 

At this point I felt pretty ready because I figured that she already knew. But it was sort of a mixed response. Basically, I got the ""I will always love you, but have fun sinning."" Which was not what I was expecting.  I tried to explain that I felt sexually attracted to both men and women and that I wasn't going to hide that, but she is basically of the opinion that I should ""choose"" to ""suppress"" my feelings towards men because...I don't know why. I've been feeling kind of hurt lately because she said a lot of stuff that stuck with me. She did way more talking during the conversation than I did, which also says something.

I used to call my Mom the Ice Queen. It's sort of endearing because it's a positive and negative connotation. Positively, she could be an ice queen because she's blond haired, blue-eyed, and is obviously stunning even going into her late 50s. Negatively, she always says shit that can cut you down so far and fast, but doesn't even realize that she's said something that has wounded someone deeply. I had a lot of those cold remarks here.

Examples: 
- ""Well this isn't something that you should choose, that bathhouse culture isn't something that's admirable.""

- ""You know that 95% of gay marriages fail right?"" 

- ""Is this something that's common? How did I get stuck with two in the family?"" 

- ""You know you can never tell your grandfather right? Actually, just hold off on telling the rest of the family until I'm ready to talk about it."" 

- ""I don't think it's a good idea for you to bring men home to the family. I mean what will people think? You don't think 
everyone will support you, do you?"" 

- Here's the worst one though, ""I think I did always know. Your Dad knew too, and he hated it. I think that's one of the reasons why he left."" (Keep in mind my Dad left the family just over a year ago and it's all still a very raw experience for all of us). 

I can go on, but you get the point. Mom isn't as open-minded about it as she thought she was. We're both out to her now and I don't even know how I feel about it. My middle brother doesn't like to talk about it or too me much anymore, so I don't bring it up. My youngest brother is still awesome to talk to, but I'm not out to him yet.

So...yeah kind of feeling defeated and more wary about coming out to the rest of the family now that the person who I figured would have my back the most doesn't at all. I feel like I need to talk with both of my brothers about it, but I'm so scared and so hurt by what my Mom has said. Any advice or comfort is appreciated. 

**TL;DR: Came out to Mom and it sucked ass. My 2nd youngest brother is gay, he's also out to Mom, and he won't talk with me about it. My 3rd youngest brother is who I'm on the best terms with, but I'm not out to him. Now, according to Mom, Dad left the family a year ago because he was unhappy with his marriage, but also apparently always knew I might be gay (I'm bisexual) and that's ""one of the reasons why he left."" Need advice and honestly just some comfort**

A couple of years ago I was seeking therapy for depression and anxiety. Those issues seemed to fade away when I was diagnosed with ADD and began treatment on that. 

This semester, I went to my university's health center to see a therapist when the anxious feelings started coming back. It's mostly future-related stuff, like applying for jobs and research deadlines that have me stressed. She doesn't know I'm bi, but has been helpful giving me strategies for dealing with the anxiety. She suggested I take this week and really look at what is worrying me so much.

I actually sat down and spent some time doing just that. I have always gotten good grades and people praise me for my smarts, which made me feel like I had to uphold some standard of excellence (note that I'm a mechanical engineer, so it's challenging). I realized that I haven't been working hard to learn the material, but because I didn't want to be **wrong**. Outside of school, I would sometimes take forever to make decisions because I was too afraid to make the **wrong** choice.  

**THE GOOD PART**

I never came out to anyone because I could never truly know how they would react. What if I came out to the **wrong** person, or at the **wrong** time? I didn't want to risk it.

I realize now that my desire to be right... my desire to be in control of every situation and know exactly what to do... it's ludicrous. This idea I've had of myself is too ideal, and I lose out on parts of being human if I try to be perfect.

Today, my best friend and I were smoking weed after work in his apartment. Many friends know I'm stressed this semester, and today he said I could talk about it with him anytime if I needed. I asked him if he meant that, he said yes. I paused for what felt like forever and my heart was racing, but I toughened up and ripped the band-aid off. I said ""Kyle, I'm bisexual"".

He just goes ""oh, that's a big one. Well don't worry, I won't tell anyone"".

**FINALLY, THE QUESTION**

So my heart rate has gone back down, and my head has cleared up significantly. But now that a few hours have gone by, I can't help but feel..  underwhelmed. I guess I expected to feel like this huge weight had been lifted off of my shoulders, but I don't really feel different at all. I just feel.... normal? It's kind of making me wonder why I bothered in the first place if it didn't make a difference. I'm guessing that this isn't the standard reaction... Any thoughts/input?

","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My background is that I am a 22 year old bisexual male, studying at a university. A couple of years ago I was seeking therapy for depression and anxiety. Those issues seemed to fade away when I was diagnosed with ADD and began treatment on that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This semester, I went to my university&amp;#39;s health center to see a therapist when the anxious feelings started coming back. It&amp;#39;s mostly future-related stuff, like applying for jobs and research deadlines that have me stressed. She doesn&amp;#39;t know I&amp;#39;m bi, but has been helpful giving me strategies for dealing with the anxiety. She suggested I take this week and really look at what is worrying me so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually sat down and spent some time doing just that. I have always gotten good grades and people praise me for my smarts, which made me feel like I had to uphold some standard of excellence (note that I&amp;#39;m a mechanical engineer, so it&amp;#39;s challenging). I realized that I haven&amp;#39;t been working hard to learn the material, but because I didn&amp;#39;t want to be &lt;strong&gt;wrong&lt;/strong&gt;. Outside of school, I would sometimes take forever to make decisions because I was too afraid to make the &lt;strong&gt;wrong&lt;/strong&gt; choice.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE GOOD PART&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never came out to anyone because I could never truly know how they would react. What if I came out to the &lt;strong&gt;wrong&lt;/strong&gt; person, or at the &lt;strong&gt;wrong&lt;/strong&gt; time? I didn&amp;#39;t want to risk it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realize now that my desire to be right... my desire to be in control of every situation and know exactly what to do... it&amp;#39;s ludicrous. This idea I&amp;#39;ve had of myself is too ideal, and I lose out on parts of being human if I try to be perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, my best friend and I were smoking weed after work in his apartment. Many friends know I&amp;#39;m stressed this semester, and today he said I could talk about it with him anytime if I needed. I asked him if he meant that, he said yes. I paused for what felt like forever and my heart was racing, but I toughened up and ripped the band-aid off. I said &amp;quot;Kyle, I&amp;#39;m bisexual&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He just goes &amp;quot;oh, that&amp;#39;s a big one. Well don&amp;#39;t worry, I won&amp;#39;t tell anyone&amp;quot;. We talked a bit, it was kind of awkward not only because we were high, but because I obviously caught him off guard (no one would have any reason to guess that I&amp;#39;m not straight). He asked me how long I had known, why I came out now and not earlier, etc. We&amp;#39;re moving in together in May with two other of our fraternity brothers, and I also mentioned that I plan to come out to them too before then. I thanked him for hearing me out and went for a handshake. He responded with a hug and said &amp;quot;for sure dude!&amp;quot;. We proceeded to max out on munchy food and watch House of Cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FINALLY, THE QUESTION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I realize I can politely decline, however I have a few concerns:

* How do you gauge if someone is asking for a date, or is simply looking to hang out?

He was so into it that he said he wanted to fuck me really badly. I knew he lived in a different hemisphere so this would never actually happen.

Then, seemingly mid-conversation. He stopped messaging me. He read my kiks, but didn't say respond. I sent some more pics and comments the next day: nothing.

So I said sarcastically that I was thrilled to be his second option (LUCKY ME!) and he lost it saying ""Fuck, calm down bro! I made plans before you messaged me."" So I said I was being sarcastic, for him to take his own advice [calm down], and that either way I didn't really need, or want, to know that he was meant to meet someone? He apologised and we continued on. I was in the middle of replying to another message later and he messaged me ""Not replying? Gluck"". I was like, ""I'm legit typing right as you sent that"". He apologised *again*, and said, ""Sorry man, awks. I'm not usually like this.""      

Funny thing is I had actually met him months back - and he was like that then too. In person he was grand, but chatting was like navigating a minefield. We chatted a little more after we met up and he was *so* defensive over the stupidest shit. He blocked me because when I said we should meet again, he replied with, ""I'm lazy, but I'll see later."" So I said, ""I'll prob look elsewhere with that attitude"". Months later, he chatted me [last week] when I changed my profile pic, but I didn't reply. Cut to tonight, after he said he doesn't usually act like that, I had to say something! I told him that we had in fact chatted before and he shouldn't take things I say personally because I don't know him personally. And he also shouldn't be so defensive, but I was gonna end the convo because it was more of the same. I finished wishing him best of luck though. He simply replied ""fuck yourself"" and blocked me two seconds later, so I couldn't even screenshot it properly for [/lolgrindr] (http://www.reddit.com/r/lolgrindr/new/), which is the real tragedy here. [Only got a couple of messages he sent me] (http://i.imgur.com/2fM6NsL.png), but all mixed up. None of my friends are up as it's 1am here and I needed to rant to some guys who would get it. Like, wtf? 

TLDR: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JVeFRRLdAc","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Defensive douches. He told me three messages in that he had plans to hookup with another guy, but that guy was busy. So I said sarcastically that I was thrilled to be his second option (LUCKY ME!) and he lost it saying &amp;quot;Fuck, calm down bro! I made plans before you messaged me.&amp;quot; So I said I was being sarcastic, for him to take his own advice [calm down], and that either way I didn&amp;#39;t really need, or want, to know that he was meant to meet someone? He apologised and we continued on. I was in the middle of replying to another message later and he messaged me &amp;quot;Not replying? Gluck&amp;quot;. I was like, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m legit typing right as you sent that&amp;quot;. He apologised &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt;, and said, &amp;quot;Sorry man, awks. I&amp;#39;m not usually like this.&amp;quot;      &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funny thing is I had actually met him months back - and he was like that then too. In person he was grand, but chatting was like navigating a minefield. We chatted a little more after we met up and he was &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; defensive over the stupidest shit. He blocked me because when I said we should meet again, he replied with, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m lazy, but I&amp;#39;ll see later.&amp;quot; So I said, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll prob look elsewhere with that attitude&amp;quot;. Months later, he chatted me [last week] when I changed my profile pic, but I didn&amp;#39;t reply. Cut to tonight, after he said he doesn&amp;#39;t usually act like that, I had to say something! I told him that we had in fact chatted before and he shouldn&amp;#39;t take things I say personally because I don&amp;#39;t know him personally. And he also shouldn&amp;#39;t be so defensive, but I was gonna end the convo because it was more of the same. I finished wishing him best of luck though.

But this seems more like a pattern she has developed.  my best friend (convoluted story how we became bffs) used to be close with her but they are no longer friends.

I'm sorry if this is a long post.

A bit of background: Met my ex on Grindr, dated for 2 months and loved every minute of it. He went overseas for some church work, and in that time I decided to sign up for the military. I had discussed this with him, and said he would support me 100% but he would need to talk about 'us'. After talking with him when he got back, he broke up with me because he felt it might not work out but still said that he liked me a lot. To say I was heart broken, is an understatement. It was love at first sight with this guy, and I kick myself every time for having the feelings I did for him because it led to a lot of crying and a lot of regret. 

I stupidly thought that we could just be friends, but that didn't work out and I told him (while crying) that we shouldn't talk for a while so I can really get over him (and I did). We didn't talk for almost 4 months when I posted a status on Facebook recently, relating to some personal issues I had resolved involving my father (which he knew about and experienced himself). He rang me and asked if I wanted to grab a dinner and talk. So I agreed and we met up. Now at this point, I had really gotten over him and genuinely only wanted to be his friend (he helped me with a lot of personal issues which I will forever be thankful for). 

Anyways, after dinner, we go for a drive to the beach and just sit (like old times). Then he starts to confess that he's missed me a lot, and has been thinking about 'us' in the time we haven't spoken and that he made a mistake in breaking up with me… and then, he leaned in to kiss me on the lips, and I pulled away. He asked what was wrong, and I said to him that I didn't know what he wanted. To which he said, that he ""wanted to be with me"" and tried to kiss me again, for me to only lean away again. 

I'm really at a stand-still, because I leave for basic training next week, and the last thing I need is to deal with this issue. It took me so long to get over the only real person I've loved, and those months sucked, but I can't help to feel that some connection is still there… 

So here I am, asking strangers for help because I don't know what to do. Part of me wants to continue my relationship with him, and an equal part of me is dead-against it. Please help

I'm a sociable person with the people that I know, but I find it hard to develop new friendships, especially if it's a 1 on 1 situation. That makes things like dates and bars pretty awkward for me.

I've been taken advantage of/sexually abused before and I am wary of other people's intentions. In my experience, most people are looking for one thing and won't take no for an answer. Even on actual dates, people pretty commonly try to coerce me into going back to theirs.

For example, I caught the attention of a handsome guy at the bar the other day. We struggled to engage in any kind of conversation because of the loud music, his strong accent, and being quite drunk. He says I should go back to his, but as there wasn't any connection beyond the physical I told him I wasn't going to. Yet he kept coming back pressuring me into going back with him.

During that night, I was out with a friend who is more or less the opposite after she's had a few drinks - being very touchy feely with everyone and making tons of friends. I'm not much of a dancer, but I was joining in. Another guy who I'd been chatting to then told me to stop looking so miserable (I have bitchy resting face) and then groped me.

I want to be more friendly, but at the same time it worries me that it would be taken the wrong way.

When I was 25, I had a friend who was 20 who started to change the nature of our friendship and I am still not sure what the Hell was going on.  Got any ideas?

First off, before this happened, we had known each other casually for like 1.5 years; we both were part of the same hobby group.  During the last 1/2 year or so, we started getting closer (it seemed).  We both started showing up early just to chat.  First it was just a few minutes, but eventually it was almost an hour early.  One day, I was late, and he said he was disappointed that we missed our weekly chat.

Then one day he asked to meet with me outside the normal time of the group meeting.  What I thought was going to be a 15-minute little chat turned into 2 hours.  Then he wanted to hang out the next day.  Then, after the next group meeting he followed me home at 11 at night; we stayed up and chatted at my place until 1 in the morning.  We hung out again a few more times, and then he followed me home again, this time at like 1 in the morning and he stayed at my place until 3 am.

The one day he asked me to go to the movies with him; he also invited a couple other guys, but only one was free.  Our friend wasn't available until after dinner, so my new buddy and I spent the whole afternoon together, had dinner, met our friend, went to the movies, then walked home together.  In total we spent like 13 hours together that day!

A few days later, I asked him and some friends to my place to watch a movie, but he couldn't come because he had a date; afterwards, he seemed incredibly disappointed that he missed out so I invited him over to watch a repeat of it.  We met for dinner, watched the movie, and again talked for hours.  At the end of the evening, he asked if I was available in 2 weeks because he was going to be back in town and might have some free time; we never met when he got back to town, but he did call to apologize for not having time.

Since I wasn't going to see him for a few months, I wrote him a nice, friendly, non-romantic ""hey bro"" letter, which elicited not 1 but 2 phone calls from him.  The next time we met, he gave me a gift based upon that hobby we shared; to this day, it's one of the best gifts I have ever gotten from a non-family member.

So, based upon this basic information (there's a lot more), what did this guy want?

1- We were just casual acquaintances and he was just wasting time.
2 - He wanted to be better friends.
3 - He was ""interested"" in me. *nudge*nudge*wink*wink.
4 - Some other option I haven't thought of.  (Like he was recruiting me for a cult!)

I'll give a debriefing in a few days if this post gets any attention.  I truly am curious what other gay guys would have thought in this situation.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey Gaybros, help a brother out.

I'm not playing the victim or insisting I'm innocent - but does he have a point? Is it all my fault? I've been back on antidepressants and lost a great deal of self confidence and interest in sex and do have mood swings as a result of this and because of frequent pain. 

The most frequent argument is my request for more help with house work as he's not working at the moment. I also want to wake up and to bed with him. (Currently he goes to bed around 4am and wakes up about 2pm) Is this unreasonable?

I'm 49 and he is 22.  I know I could be his father.  We became friends first.  We get a long great.  He does not act like most gay ""kids"" his age.  Not into the gay scene.  Doesn't toss around those irritating slang terms like ""girl"" and ""work it bitch"" etc.  This past January he came over and we were just talking.  I didn't think he'd even be interested in me romantically anyways because I am also hiv positive and older.  I'm handsome and don't look my age. You get the point.  After two hours of really talking he puts his head in my lap and says ""this is nice"".  This was a Saturday night, he left Monday morning.  It was the best weekend I think I ever had with a man and I've had a lot.  There was no sex.  Just lots of intimacy.  Holding, touching, laying together talking.  Sure there was chemistry but we both didn't want to just go straight to bed and end up where we always both have.  

We have another thing in common we are both former meth users.  Any gay man who has used meth and had sex knows how awesome it is.  I have been off of it a lot longer than he has and has learned to enjoy sex sober.  He has not.  So now we when get started intimately and get to a certain point we have to stop because it triggers him to want to use.  He actually asked me to get high with him so we could fuck.  It was very tempting.  We talked about it and I told him I would just wait until he was ready for sex in sobriety.  

How long is too long to wait?

Is there a time limit.

I have never loved a man like I do this one.  He could be 62 instead of 22 and it wouldn't matter.  it's his mind and heart I fell in love with.  Yes he's an average handsome guy and physically I am attracted to him.

We spend evenings together cooking, watching movies, a lot of talking and god I love this guy.

Anyone else ever been through this?

I think I have to put my dog down tomorrow. She's really sick. And I'm really lost. 

I've been pretty proud of my ability to love myself and fine being single and alone so much, but after she's gone then that's it. I will be absolutely alone. She's been with me for 12 years and has gotten me through so much hell. 

I don't know what to do. My best friend is dying.

My friends aren't the most reliable people. They can't be here as much as I could use them. And they also are incapable of dealing with other peoples' problems. 

I've been undergoing a lot of loss lately. And I'm exhausted. I already see a counselor once a week. And no, I'm not getting another dog. That just seems weird to me. 

Any and all advice will be much appreciated. I just need a hug. 


EDIT: I just got home after putting her down. 

That was the hardest thing I have ever done. It was so quick. I don't even know what to do. 

So I put her things in my car and will donate them to a good shelter I used to volunteer with. 

My home is so empty. It's so quiet. Her collar was in my pocket and as I took it out I heard the jingle and thought that she was coming. 

My god it was so fast. Just like that. And her eyes were open. Staring at me. Dead. This was so much harder than losing my dad. 

I have to go to the doctor today to try and get this stupid cough taken care of. 

I haven't wailed like that in years. My best friend is gone and I feel absolutely alone and isolated and my heart is so dry and cold and broken. 

But I'm proud of myself. I made the executive decision and the right decision. I don't feel closure from it. I don't at all. But I know she won't be crying and bleeding to death in the middle of the night while in miserable pain. 

She died happy. A bit scared, lost, confused. But I was there holding her. 

I miss her so much. 

EDIT 2: Hi all,

Thank you again for the outpouring love. 

The day after I went and got a massage, went to the gym, got a haircut, and saw a counselor. 

I feel a lot better. Today I went to the gym and started getting back to my work slowly. 

I feel like this is the universe's way of saying that I am ready to go it alone. I can do this. She's always with me. I love her so much and I know she loves me. 

A lot in my life has been changing and a lot of change is to come. And I can do this. She got me through the most difficult things in my life. And I'm ready to continue influencing the world in a positive way and helping others. 

Thank you for your outpouring love. It really has helped me a lot. Thank you so much. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Gaybros,&lt;/p&gt;

He's in his early thirties, I'm in my early twenties. 

We talked for an hour before going over to his apartment and having sex, the chemistry was great and I felt so wonderful about the whole thing. 

His phone rang from his jacket pocket when he wasn't in the room and I saw it was from a women, he also had about 30 cards with his name on it which wasn't the name he had given me and it shared a surname with the women calling, the address on it wasn't even in the state. Everything he said was probably bullshit. 

I decided not to say anything, I don't like drama. When I got home I googled him and found his facebook page, he's married and has three kids, looks like such a happy family.

It's so weird to look over his pictures with his wife and kids knowing what I know and what I've done.  

What should I do? I'm thinking I should just move on, what do you think?
