I am in need of a bit of advice regarding anal sex. So I am somewhat new to the world of bottoming and basically, I am having trouble with taking longer dicks. I start to get a jabbing pain when it's so far in and have to get them to slow down.  I have wondered if this is just a problem with practice? Girth doesn't seem to be too much of a problem (or atleast in my experience so far) its the length which is getting problematic. 

With respect to practicing myself, I have slowly moved from fingers &gt; multiples of them &gt; small toys and I'm onto a medium size toy now. And the same problem has arisen - I get so far and it starts to pain like the sensation of jabbing.

I really need some social support on this one. Have other people dealt with something similar or experienced it themselves? What might be some tips or things I should try? Also, I have to say it's pretty frustrating at the moment, the will is there but the body is saying otherwise...for now anyway.  

Cheers guys!

Yes, it involves my ‘straight’ friend - wow what a surprise huh?

But first I feel like I need to give some backstory. I am a fully closeted 20 y/o, and am finally coming to terms with the fact I am gay. Boy, it has been a long road  - there was never a moment in which it clicked that I was gay, more a gradual progression. One that featured much denial, anger etc... starting from around 15 when I discovered porn &amp; masturbation (late bloomer). I slowly transitioned from straight to gay porn but even then did not accept my gayness. It was only about a year ago that I EVENTUALLY began to accept that I am in fact gay (still feels weird to write it).

I have not come out to anyone before, I don’t think I am ready to trust someone with that information before I am fully ready to come out. The thought of telling my family and friends brings on tears and makes me sick to my stomach. I am 99% sure my parents and siblings would take it well, but not so sure about grandparents and extended family. 

Friends are another issue altogether - because I am so deeply closeted and don’t come across as gay, we talk about people from school who came out. Let’s just say the comments are not always positive, I know they are half joking but it hurts me deep inside to realise this is how they would talk about ME behind my back if they knew. So yeah, I have to emphasise while progress has been made, I am in no way shape or form ready or psyched up enough to come out yet.

Making the situation worse is the fact that I have no gay friends (a common theme it seems with people who have these straight guy high school crushes). I actually feel really comfortable around my straight mates, and I feel like I am straight in every respect apart from well, the gay part (I hope you understand what I’m getting at). I have even hooked up with many girls in town, I guess to keep up a persona - never slept with any though. I have had two random, drunken gay experiences but these were with complete strangers and were quickly shut down by me.

Okay this is getting really long (sorry) and I haven’t started on my friend yet but I wanted to give some backstory and emphasise that I am not in a position to come out yet.

So, my ‘straight’ friend comes into the picture at the start of secondary school (sorry, not american) - about 11-12 y/o I guess. To start with I hardly even noticed him, just sort of an extra in my life. When we were probably 15 we started to hang out a bit, being in the same friend group. This is where the little things started.

He would sit unnecessarily close to me on the couch. I would bend over to tie my shoe and he would jokingly dry hump my butt. He would randomly jump up and start play fighting with me and then just sort of lie on top of me. He would sit on my lap… the list goes on. One time at a school ball (prom), he deliberately rubbed past me, making me feel his rock hard erection on my thigh.

So inevitably I started to fantasise about him and developed a crush on him. Being a bit of an awkward kid myself, and deeply closeted, I would hardly initiate these ‘events’ myself and if I did it would be something small like touching his thigh with mine when we were sitting next to each other. Often, he would move his leg away and say something like ‘Don’t be such a fag’ or ‘Stop trying to kiss me’.

I don’t really see him making that much contact with our other friends, and as you can imagine, my brain goes into overdrive, going over every contact that happens, feeling elated one minute, devastated the next - just classic crush behaviour. Its the over analysis which really gets to me though.

I moved away for university (college) when I left school, and these thoughts would fade over time, which was really nice, but as soon as I come home for the summer the feelings are quick to return. This current summer (southern hemisphere), we have been better mates than ever, spending more time together than ever before.

So heres the dilemma - I have my suspicions he is not as straight as he might claim (sorta like me!), but at the same time I am equally sure that he is. Even if he is in fact gay, I don’t even know if he likes me. He will always have multiple girls on the go and even invited one back to my house the other night when a few of us were having drinks there (and got a hand job). But then i’ll watch him in public and his eyes will follow the guys who wander past, not the women. I am so confused and it is doing my head in. By this point, I would have assumed something would have happened between us by now if he did fancy me, but then again I haven’t been very forward either, and he can be a little awkward/shy himself.

I need a resolution - either something substantial happens here or I bury my thoughts and move on with my life, rejecting any further contact he tries to make because I just wouldn’t be able to handle it anymore. I would really like to try initiate something, but in a subtle enough way that it would not blow my cover or leave me deeply rejected and hurting. I definitely feel there is SOMETHING between us but it could very realistically be all in my head.

Any advice on how I progress from this point onwards? How do I know if he’s really gay or not? And that he likes me? Were all those ‘contacts’ meaningless or were they him trying to make some sort of move? 

I’m sure some of you have been in similar situations… please… guys?!

Oh god this is killing me bros. Sorry about the essay and verbal diarrhoea but it feels good to finally put my thoughts into writing.

&lt;p&gt;I need a resolution - either something substantial happens here or I bury my thoughts and move on with my life, rejecting any further contact he tries to make because I just wouldn’t be able to handle it anymore. I would really like to try initiate something, but in a subtle enough way that it would not blow my cover or leave me deeply rejected and hurting. I definitely feel there is SOMETHING between us but it could very realistically be all in my head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any advice on how I progress from this point onwards? How do I know if he’s really gay or not? And that he likes me? Were all those ‘contacts’ meaningless or were they him trying to make some sort of move? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sure some of you have been in similar situations… please… guys?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh god this is killing me bros. Sorry about the essay and verbal diarrhoea but it feels good to finally put my thoughts into writing. &lt;/p&gt;

So I stayed at my parents house last weekend and my niece who is 5 was there, who I adore, shes the only niece or nephew I have. I was hanging out with her before I was leaving to go to my boyfriends. When the time came she asked me where I was going and I said 'to my boyfriends', which I could see confused her somewhat as shes never had this idea put to her before. She asks if we kiss and I say that sometimes boys kiss boys and sometimes girls kiss girls, nothing more. She then asks me if we will sleep together and if we'll be naked, at this I said no I will be going to my own house and to my own bed and that was really it.

The next day I was due to meet my mom in town but she ignored all 8 of my calls throughout the day. My dad eventually called me that night and said after I left that my niece brought up me and my boyfriend at the dinner table and that we get naked in bed etc. I assured him that yes I said I was going to my boyfriends but that it was her who put the question to me about sleeping arrangements...so now my mom isnt talking to me thinking that im spreading some gay agenda or recruiting my niece or some shit, assuming the worst of me without even talking to me. My sister told me she felt sick when she heard her daughter say this, meanwhile she has had 3 different relationships including my niece's father so my niece is acquainted with the term 'boyfriend' and has connotations associated with it from elsewhere, least of all me.

In hindsight, I shouldn't have said anything about where I was going I guess, but I didn't see the harm really, the worst being that she'll grow up thinking its ok for members of the same sex to be together...fairly torn about the whole thing to be honest. Im 24 and came out last April, my folks only really came round to the idea a few months ago and now this...

I'de appreciate some input bros :)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just wanted to throw this out there and see what the general consensus is...&lt;/p&gt;

We are still together.

To those who doubted, it CAN work.

I told him I knew about everything. I made him tell me. Some of it was taken out of context and he proved it. It was a power play that was the catalyst for the entire event. It was much more harmless than initially believed but still hurtful and awful.

To those with similar problems, communication is key. Be open about your feelings and don't sit on them. It will only prove more difficult and drive you absolutely insane if you keep your feelings and knowledge hidden.

I wish all of you with problems like this luck. I would also like to thank all of you who messaged me with votes of confidence and your kind words.
