I'm in a depression, don't have many friends, and a job that drives me crazy. I wasn't thinking clearly, and now I (sort of) regret what I did. 

I hooked up with this guy on Grindr, he's 18, I'm 20, we chatted for a bit and he was a really nice and relaxed guy. Anyway we hit it off and he blew me and then rode me (I was sitting in a chair, he was ridding on top of me if that makes sense). I wasn't wearing a condom, he came, I didn't. I didn't reciprocate. It was fairly quick, about 10 minutes or less. He said he was clean (yeah I know, people can lie) and I know I'm clean. There wasn't any blood, he looked really healthy and skinny (he was a twink). Afterwards, about 30 minutes later, I went home, urinated, and showered and cleaned down there very well. 

TL;DR: Depressed, life has really gone down hill fast, hooked up with a guy, he rode me bareback, I didn't cum, lasted for less than 10 minutes, 30 mins later went home urinated and showered. What's the chances I've really fucked up?

I'm up to date on all of my immunizations and I'm in fairly good health. What's the chances that I caught something? 

Again, I know what I did was really fucking stupid. 

edit: And we're also catching dinner this weekend...

**Update:** Thank you everyone for your comments and support, except that one asshole (you know who you are). They got me on Truvada and Isentress. 

**Also:** As someone who is always in good health, I didn't realize how expensive these meds were. Without insurance, it would have cost roughly $4,200 for the meds. My total balance due was $50.

Last week I joined Squirt (just a hookup site). I got a message from a 21yo and we chatted from there. We had some common interests. We met on Sunday and just talked, he was really nice. He noticed that I was shy and anxious and asked questions about it. I didn't go into details of the disorder of course, but I told him a little. He's studying postgrad at uni, has a job, ambition, a wide social circle and drives. I felt like a complete Joe Blow compared to him. 

We went back to mine where we talked some more and did kissing and cuddling. He was very understanding and confiding and said that he'd like to help me come of my shell. He stressed the fact that I would need to be completely open and honest to him when/if I feel uncomfortable about something he says. I just got an overall really nice and welcoming impression from him. By this stage I had no interest in hookups and deleted my profile. 

A few days later, he brought lunch and we talked/cuddled again. He asked why I deleted my profile, I said it was because I didn't feel that I needed it anymore and because I had him in my life now. I tried not to come across as attached. But I think I am. He said not to feel stressed if I want to go back on Squirt if I want to meet guys and not to delete my profile on his account. I guess that means he still intends on meeting guys and is worried that I am getting my hopes up too much. 

We have kept in touch by texting during the day. Not much though, since he has a busy schedule. I think we're meeting again on Sunday or Monday. I'm not going to lie, I want to be together with him. And it is this that has caused me so much turmoil this week. One problem or negative thought spawns half a dozen others. It's debilitating, it's driving me crazy. I cried myself to sleep last night. I don't know why. I just felt despair and hopelessness like no other. I'm on the verge of crying now. 

The small amount of rationality in me knows the basics of what is wrong. There's the inadequacy thoughts on my part that I mentioned earlier on (comparing my life to his). And I know the fact that if he wishes to keep his options open by keeping his site profile and seeing other guys, that's perfectly normal. And I know that this is the first guy in years that I've met and think they're relationship material, yet I haven't been in a relationship before and don't know what love is. 

From the sparse details I have told him, he thinks I just have anxiety around people. If I give him the big picture (avoidant personality disorder and depression) I'm scared that he's going to run a thousand miles, or at least give me the 'friends only' response. I don't even know if I should tell him, since I just met him. Even if we entered a relationship, it would get out of hand. It would be too much work on his part to meet my needs (like being justified often and having lots of contact and having to sometimes work around my social restrictions) and it would be enough to wear out anyone. And what happens after that is that people seek greener pastures and end up cheating.

I prefer ordered lists, as I’ve been in therapy for a long time and I’m done with the bullshit meandering and small talk that doesn’t necessarily lead to anywhere.  I don’t expect any one answer to come and save me, but maybe somehow by writing it out will help me cope with life.  It’s a weird sort of sensation to know you need help, but I guess I’ve been that way my whole life.

1)  Who exactly am I?  This might some seem a normal question for someone on the cusp of graduating college, but for me it means something different altogether.  I’ve been on medications for depression and anxiety for the last nine years of my life and a constant question starts to bubble in my head whenever I occasionally lapse on my meds (seriously, anti-anxiety meds make me feel okay with missing a dose or five, which is horribly, yet hilariously, ironic).  But even more so, considering how much I drink, I have to wonder, is it me that people like, or is the drunk persona I let people see?  It’s a strange thought that probes my mind from time to time, but considering how often I’m drunk, it makes me wonder if people like the real me or just the façade they see when I’m hammered.  (I do like being hammered though).  Ah who knows?  People are just constantly fluctuating states of sobriety in my opinion.  Oh hey, this brings me to my next point.

2) My brothers.  I’ve been involved with my fraternity for the last three years of my life, and god damn if people tell me that I haven’t tried my damnst to make it a better place.  I’ll skip the history of what this place means to me, but certain brothers just ruin me.  Coincidentally, this also leads into other issues.  Primarily, I’ll begin with Moose.  This son of a bitch is the epitome of a straight crush for me.  Even further than that, he does one thing I’ve never encountered with all of my hookups and boyfriends combined; he makes me want to be a better person.  Fuck him.  Oh I know the sayings about straight crushes, but as a person who’s never actually been in complete love for a person before, this is hard to take lying down.  What’s worse, if hilariously sad, is the trust he places in me with certain secrets about his sex life.  You ever listen to the man of your dreams, a guy who wants to go on drunken adventures with you despite the outcome and trusts you implicitly because of your relation as frat bros, tell you about his sex life? It’s literally hell.  What’s worse is that I can’t even talk to other bros about this, as my frat bros are all I’ve got.  Odd conversations about the things you wish you could do abound lead to awkward situations if you know what I mean.  But even further than that is the sexual anxiety I feel when it comes to other guys.  Sure I’m in a small college and my selections are limited, but as a bottom who is perpetually plagued by hemorrhoids and what may be herpes (just found what might be a cold sole on my mouth), shits rough, yo.  What pisses me off about the sexual frustration the most though, is that I haven’t been laid for a year prior to my last hook up (which was a month ago) I had been clean.  And then this shit?  Seriously? Can I have sex once without some sort of STD scare?  Or with someone I actually like?  

3)  Finally, here’s the worst part, the future.  Every college senior worries about what’s in store for them when they graduate and I’ve got the same concerns as everyone else.  But what’s worse is considering the future I have with the people I’ve made close relationships with.  I love my best friends, but I recognize that ultimately they are damaging to me in many ways.  If I had to write a song about them, it would be titled “Drunks don’t let friends get sober.”  What’s hard is that I didn’t have friends in high school and now that I’ve finally found friends, it’s conflicting to let them go.  Do I move my entire life to follow my best friend, who is, in all honesty, kind of a shit head but still a great guy and try and make things work wherever we decide to move (I mean, Seattle doesn’t seem that bad, right?)?  I dunno know man, all I know is I can’t live with my parents anymore, which is ultimately going to cause some major discontent in a few months when I graduate.

Fuck me, bros.  I try to be a good person, and I’ve worked hard to be in the best place I could be in.  But sometimes, its all just so overwhelming.  Hell, I’ve got all these issues and I didn’t even include being a closet furry for all that’s worth (my name is wherewulfe, fucking get it?  I would extrapolate more, but that would’ve been point 4 in which I describe always being a black sheep wherever I go).  I dunno guys.  I just need someone to hold me tightly for a night or eight and let me know it’s all gonna keep moving on, rather I like it or not.

Unfortunately, I don't have much of a love life whatsoever. Until 1 month ago I even was a virgin. After years of trying to find a boyfriend I decided to lose my virginity in a one night stand due to my age. 

One of the few things I actually like about my life right is how well I'm doing at university. Unfortunately, I have to work a lot to pay for my expenses. Still, I've managed to get quite a good grade average so far. My research has been accolade-winning. It has been lauded by several academics. My supervisor even wants me back for more research. However, I just had to decide between producing a controversial, important piece of research and a specialised programme. I ended up picking the specialised program. Therefore my groundbreaking research will have to wait.

There are several things I can't stand about university, though. For one, I hate how long it takes to get your grades. I usually email my professors one week after exams because I REALLY want to know my grades. They still won't tell me, though. 

Getting grades for assignments is a pain as well. I don't understand why university lecturers can't just put up a list with everyone's names and grades for students to see. I'm always very curious about other people's grades but they won't always tell me.

The only thing I love about waiting for grades is how anxious everyone else gets. Haha.

One thing I really love about university is talking to academics. After lectures I always stay behind to talk to lecturers. They really appreciate talking to someone as intelligent and accomplished as I am. Several of them have expressed interest in working with me on research in the future.

We talked, went on a few dates and have been hanging out. We text and he is a pretty stellar guy. I've expressed interest in dating him and he said he would like to get to know me more. He has mentioned before he is a bit a voyeur (and let's face it, who isn't) so I didn't think much of it. In talking yesterday, we were talking about a previous conversation we had. I was playfully arguing my point and he said I had said something different. After a bit he says ""do I need to send you the tape!?"" So I responded ""tape?"" And he says ""yeah, didn't I tell you I have a camera in my room?"" I said no and he said he would explain later. I asked him to explain now and he asked to call but I couldn't talk on the phone at the time. So we are supposed to talk today and I'm trying to keep calm but we have had sex a few times in his room and I'm just not comfortable with the idea of being recorded without my permission in a private setting. I know that his house has a security system, but I never thought there could be more than an alarm.  Has anyone else ever dealt with this? Could I be over reacting a bit? I am talking with him tonight and telling him my stance on it, but I am hearing him out first and going from there. 


Update: Okay, talked with him. He said he thought I knew he was joking. I told him where I stood on the issue and that if he ever did or does do anything like that, that he looses my trust completely, that he will regret the very idea, and that I'll take him to court over the issue. I also told him that the next time I go over I'm doing a thorough check of the whole house and all his electronics and that either way he lost a lot of trust and major points with me. At this point, I'm weary. I have major trust issues and he made me feel like I couldn't trust him. I don't like that.

So this happened a few months ago &amp; I don't really care anymore (well, it still bothers me a bit...but whatevs lol) but I JUST found out this subreddit existed, and I wanted some opinions I guess lol. 

Backstory: I met this guy on Growlr like a week before Christmas. Let's call him Ben. Ben was a white 30 y/o slim blond hair blue eyed nerdy bro. 100% my type. I messaged him and we started talking that whole day (we even exchanged a bunch of random pics and our phone numbers) until he had to go into work that afternoon. We bonded over books we've read, video games we've played...etc.

From that day we would talk every now and then. He didn't really text too much, since he said he worked retail and christmas was a busy time for him. Completely understandable. 

After talking a bit more, on January 3rd, we went out to lunch to have some burgers. Not really sure if it was a first date or not....but I guess I'll count it lol. It was the first time meeting in person, he seemed to really like me, and I sure as hell liked him. Our lunch ended up being like 4 hours long, we just talked and talked lol. He even suggested going for ice cream after lunch (to which I treated).

When we said goodbye, we hugged each other, and he mentioned how his house is a complete mess and he hasn't had time to clean. If it was cleaner, he would invite me. We left it at we'd stay in touch, and when he cleaned he would invite me to his place and we would hang out maybe watch some netflix. 

Days go by, I don't hear from him. Of course, I want to talk to him, so I start texting him. He'd reply like 5 hours later, sometimes at like 2 am when I was asleep. He said he's been crazy busy, so I gave him more space. I text him one day and he told me he got promoted to manager of his own store, blah blah. And I figured he'd still be busy, so I gave him more space. Mid January I went out of town for like a week and a half, and I didn't bother texting him in that whole time. When I got back I texted him, he didn't even know I was gone, but I still kept texting him. And as usual, he'd reply 5-6 hours later. 

The 20th, I was just really frustrated with him and I snapped (Mind you, I still really liked him at this time, but I hadn't let him know just how much)I wrote him this: ""Alright, don't mean to sound whiny but I want to take a chance here; I really like you. I would like to continue to get to know you, and maybe take this even deeper. I completely understand that you're busy, but I've been in situations where I have worked 13-14 hours straight, with no lunch breaks, yet somehow I made time for the people I wanted to talk to... I feel like you rarely talk to me, and really it's just me trying to get your attention for a month now. I just really want to know if you feel anything towards me at all. If you don't, please let me know so that I can stop wasting both our times."" 

Never heard back from him after that. I gave it a few days, but nada, I moved on. It gets me mad that he was just really flaky about everything and dodged me, when really I just wanted a straight answer. The rejection doesn't bother me, but the dishonesty is what make me so mad about it looking back.

Just wanna know bros, what do you think? Should I have sent it? Should I have just kept waiting? do you think he was even into me?

I'm a bisexual and I'm fairly new at being with guys. Long story short, I never wanted to do anal (even with girls), I always thought it was really gross since that's, ya know, your shitter lol and I never saw how it could be arousing (I sort of had a mental/physiological block that wouldn't even let me dream of it) but lately I've been opening up to the idea of anal. I met someone recently that I think could definitely be the one I'd be willing to try it for lol. I'm not sure what my anal role would be since I'd never done it..although I have a feeling I'm a Vers lol 

Of course for me, safety comes above all and I want to make sure everything is safe before we go at it lol. So any advice you guys can give me for a first timer? 

Also, this is a bit gross, but bear with me, I tend to go #2 about 3-4 times a day. Since I go so frequently, my asshole feels very raw and I actually start to bleed a little bit when I wipe, and when I check there is blood on the toilet paper.

This is a complete change from previous times where I would be able to get an erection from making out with him and be able to go at it again after like 10 minutes.
