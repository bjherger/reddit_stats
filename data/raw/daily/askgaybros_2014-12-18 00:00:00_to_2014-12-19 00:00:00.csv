I came out to my best friend (female) a year ago today. Since then, I think my life has gotten better. Over all, it's definitely way better being out of the closet, but now there's a new set of issues to deal with. Rather than just fawning over guys, now I get to pursue them. And 99% of the time, this has led to rejection. But I also find myself not being ready for anything serious when it's presented by someone I'm not very into and just wanting to have sex, as many 21-year-old males are wont to do.

Anyways, the single life for someone who has visions of being in a committed relationship some day is obviously frustrating and I'm wondering if the realities of being an out, gay man change as you get older; if these things get easier or if you get more jaded. Obviously it depends, but I'd like to hear what you have to say about the subject.

Thanks!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey there,&lt;/p&gt;

I only have romantic feelings for women, I've never had a crush on a guy, I've only had girlfriends, I've always identified as straight. 

But I'm just so much MORE sexually attracted to guys. It's always been like that. I can still get off with girls and it's not impacting my relationships, but when I'm alone I'll only really use gay porn. I try forcing myself to use straight porn but I always end up looking at the guy. Lesbian porn doesn't appeal to me at all.

It's tough to deal with because I feel like I'll either never be fully attracted to my girlfriend more than anyone else, and I can't date a guy because I just have no feelings for guys. 

I'll notice cute guys, but that's more like 'Oh look, they're so hot.' 
When I notice attractive girls, I think they're gorgeous but I never imagine them in sexual ways like people seem to do.

TLDR: Romantically I like girls but not boys, sexually I like guys more than girls.

If anyone has any advice or experience I'd be grateful to hear it.

But she kept saying things like, ""all the guys you like look like LITTLE BOYS!"" I know she was joking, but still it made me feel kinda....dirty, or something.

I'm not a pedophile (lol), but I am VERY sexually attracted to boyish looking men. I don't like body hair, I prefer shorter, and I like boyish faces. Brown hair typically, and gorgeous brown eyes, not really tan but not really pale either, and hair is very important to me as well. I also prefer not ""obviously"" gay guys.

Is this a common thing? Am I in the minority here? Is this weird?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello! Long time lurker, but I made a throwaway for this.&lt;/p&gt;

He approached me after class and we had a conversation about physics. After that, I noticed he would stare at me in class and look away if I caught him. He would approach me and seemingly try to flirt with me, he would at one moment be shy and at the next try to impress me. Anyway, he showed me every sign in the book... you name it, he showed it. Eventually I allowed him in and we became friends. When I first saw him, to be honest I thought he seemed like a bit of an insensitive bro. How horribly wrong I was -- me and him got along fabulously and as I got to know him I found him to be one of the most inspiring and unique individuals I've ever met -- a true one of a kind, full of vitality and life that I've never really seen before; he had a love and empathy for everyone he'd ever met, his relationship with his sibling's and parent's was... beautiful... might sound ridiculous, but he truly is an incredible human being. Probably the sweetest person, most fun person I've ever met.

Anyway, back to the story, we met up again at the start of the next semester and would sometimes study together. He still seemed nervous around me and would awkwardly stare/look away and just generally show interest. By his behaviour, I made the horrible assumption that he was a closet case who was ""secretly"" into me. Over the next year, we continued being friends and I learned more and more about him, and frankly... though nothing really was ever sexual or romantic, I fell deeper and deeper in love with him. The profundity of my emotional attachment is ineffable. He was so ambiguous about his sexuality this entire time. He never talked about women, about being in a relationship, he was single the entire time... again I chalked this up to him being a closet case.

Fast forward to two days ago, when a (girl)friend of my was showing me her tinder, and flicking through matches just for the fun of it. And lo and behold, there he is, he comes up as a match on my friend's Tinder. I couldn't believe it. He was straight. No closet case would ever make a Tinder account and use it. He didn't know her so we opened up a conversation (he matched with her... great...) and started talking to him... once again he proved himself to be so sweet thru even a text conversation. Eventually we told him who I was, which he was surprised to hear. He told me over Tinder: ""I'm cool with gay people and I suppose everyone might be a little bit flexible, but I've never had the desire to be with a man, ever"". That's exactly how every truly straight person I've met has described their heterosexuality. his honestly was undeniable.

My heart shattered. I had always been too shy to confront him about how I feel, and always assumed he was too afraid to confront me about my feelings as well. Well the next day I did, and he told me that he was indeed fully straight, always has been, but that he still loved me deeply and wanted me in his life. I thanked him for his honesty, went home and balled my eyes out. He never knew I was gay either because I'm a closet case. I'm such a coward.

I know it sounds ridiculous, but I was/am completely head over heels with this man; I thought of him as the love of my life. He has every quality I've wanted in a man; on top of this, he's probably the best looking man I've ever seen. Unbelievably handsome. The fact is that I'll never find someone as good as him in my entire life, there's just no chance of it ever happening. I was hopelessly devoted to him even though we were just friends. I made a (gay) tinder account just to see what else is out there, and it literally made me cry. for these years (and now) I've been completely unable to see anyone else in a sexual/romantic sense other than him -- I had no relationships, sought after no one other than him, and became basically emotionally devoted to him; not by my own choosing, but rather by my nature. My degree of my love and respect for him, to be honest, is not something that everyone gets to experience in their life... He made me believe love was something that actually existed, that one truly can find someone and dedicate their life to one person, to never feel the desire to stray. He made me believe monogamy was no myth. I sincerely believe that.

The pain I'm in now is unbearable. When I lie in bed at night, my body starts shaking uncontrollably. I pull myself into the fetal position. I can't stop thinking about him. I've thrown up several times. Life feels so empty -- I can't even listen to music, watch TV or have a conversation; I have no interest in anything. I want to scream.

So the truth of his ""flirty"" behaviour was of course that he was just the most friendly person one could ever come across. He had a sincere interest in me as a friend, he also saw me as a rare find and therefore did what he could to secure me as a friend. all those signs of attraction I read too much into; all for naught. he's just loving with everyone.

I don't know how to get over this heartbreak. I suppose I'm posting this solely because I need to get it out there, and that I need some sympathy and people to say things to me. I honestly don't think I can ever love again. I honestly think that objectively speaking, I'll never meet someone of his caliber again. That was it. Every other person will be a facsimile of the romance I had for him. It's like meeting anyone extremely unique; you feel so blessed that you get to know them, and simultaneously sad for the fact that when they're gone you're never going to meet anyone like them ever again. And you may say I will, but time has told me he's the rarest of beasts.

tbh, it really on my end is the perfect storm of stupidity. I feel unbelievably stupid. I've wasted so much time and energy being secretly in love with this man that I lived in my own little fantasy world. I have to go from seeing him almost everyday to basically cutting him completely out of my life. the pain, the pain...
TLDR: guy I fell deeply in love with (the most handsome man I've ever met, I wish I could share pictures) who for some reason I convinced myself was gay actually turned out to be straight and now I'm utterly shattered.
