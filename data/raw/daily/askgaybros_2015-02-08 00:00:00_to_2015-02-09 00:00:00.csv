Hello! I've been lurking around this sub for a while, I had a great time here! The bros are awesome. My awkward wording are largely due to English is not my first language, so I apologise.

Just to let it out there, I'm a twentysomething male who identify my orientation as a biromantic asexual and enjoy yoga and sprinting (although I know jack about cars - does that make me a Bro?). I come here often because this sub is lighthearted, and while I do browse lesbian subs I feel more comfortable here because I'm a male? Does my verbal diarrhoea make any sense?

Anyway what I want to ask is:

- What does it feel like to be hugged by someone?

I know this will sound so ""oh poor me so autistic I've never been loved, woe is me"",  but I do really want to know. As far as I remember the last time I received a hug is back in third grade by my classmate. It doesn't help that I get squicked fast enough if someone gets close to my bubble. I mean, does it feel good? I read somewhere that it actually helps lower stress, is that true?

- What does it feel like to have your hand be held by someone?

Being a biroace myself I feel like sometimes I'll never met that special someone. While I don't enjoy sexual contact, I wonder what will it feels like to be hugged by someone that you care about romantically, feeling that space between your fingers clasped tightly by your SO's hand...

- Is it awesome that your SO's face is the first thing in the morning and the last thing in the evening that you see?

My parents marriage, although these months are quite smooth, was pretty horrible during the times that I live with them (until high school). I strongly believe that you should NEVER fight in front of your children NOR that your kids can hear you had a row, however my parents does not seem to get the memo. They even reached that point where they discussed about divorce with us their kids, although they always made up. I don't want to blame them, but to be quite honest... 

I am... Terrified of getting close to someone, romantically. Although I never dated anyone to this day, I know that I am the type who doesn't fall easily, but when I DO fall, I fall hard and deep. I think I can never fight my SO. I am a people pleaser. Which will make a total doormat in any relationship that I will have. If love is the greatest thing on earth, why does so many couple separate that easily? Which then make my diva spirit went all "" I am a strong independent men, I don't need no men/women beside me"",  which is good at least because it'll fill me with self-righteous confidence for days... But when I lay on my side in my bed at night, I wonder what will it feel like to see your SO face. Which will bum me out terribly. And the cycle goes on.

- Will it get any better someday?

Ugh I cringe so hard typing that, but will it guys? 

I'm terribly sorry if this garbage is a waste of time. Mods feel free to delete this haha

Thank you so much bros :)

So I am moving to Melbourne in 2 weeks and am starting to get a bit overwhelmed. I am relocating to try and find work after finishing my degree and not being able to find any work where I currently am.

I come from a reasonably small city so think Melbourne will be a bit of a change.
I think the main thing I am worried about is meeting new people and making friends. I don't really want to rely on grindr to try and make friends :/

Also any areas to recommend living or areas to avoid?

It's been going great. He visited me in December and we had a fun time. Several things have clued me into his plan to send me a gift and ask me to be his boyfriend on Valentine's Day.

So here's why I asked: a couple things about him concern me and I'm not sure whether they are worth saying no, or if I can/should be flexible.
When we first met,  I discussed sex with him and shared that I believe it's important to be safe and get tested regularly. So, before we ever had sex without a condom he told me that he gets tested regularly when he goes to the doctor for asthma check ups. However since I have known him, he has not been to the doctor for asthma check ups. Hence, he has not been tested regularly monthly as he first said. I have come to learn that he exaggerates somewhat on a few things, so that's why I question whether I think this is ""no"" worthy.

Another thing, he and his ex broke up over a year ago and he assured me that he would never get back with them because the guy is bad for him. They had a bad break up and the guy treated him poorly and screwed him over for some money. 
One thing I find concerning is that he keeps pictures of him and his ex. Now, I'm not worried about that type of thing because I have come to find that he is not the type to clean up old pictures or old post on social media. But regardless of that I don't want to think of or look at pictures of him and his ex together. 
Also, his ex doesn't live in the same state anymore so that's another layer of security. 
 
It's just...I haven't been in a relationship for 4 years and it was really easy being single and not having to deal with this type of stuff. But I've found that i really enjoy myself when I'm with him and I can be my whole self with him.

I'm a college sophomore and I feel like all I've experienced from guys is rejection. I've met guys, from apps or school, and we might go on a date or two but after than they invariably stop talking to me. I have come to expect rejection from guys I meet. What bothers me is not the rejection, of course one is to expect much of that, but it seems like I have a very high rate of rejection. This is a perception, and it may be wrong, but I was wondering if anyone else feels, or had felt, the same and if that changed. If it changed, what made it change? 

I am outgoing, involved, a good conversationalist and am decently good looking. I've lately felt a bit depressed by my bad luck. Should I completely withdraw from dating and focus completely on working, school and going to the gym? Is it just difficult to find serious guys looking for a relationship at my age (20 years)? Should I commit to working out much more so that I can have a more athletic body?  

Haha I understand this is a very broad question, but I just implore your advice for what I should do at this stage in life, and how I should interpret rejection.

It's mostly two seperate things: 1. My seuxal experiences aren't too limited, but they're a LOT less then i'd like them to be (iv'e only done anal once though tried 3 times). When im planning sex, blowjobs or anal even, espically if its for a different day, i get super anxious and also horny while waiting. It distracts me the entire time im waiting and even if i jack off it comes back fairly quickly.

2. I also will randomly go into that super horny state at random times. I'll wake up and be extremely horny all day, occasionally multiple days, and while jacking off helps, i get super horny again a lot quicker then if it was on a normal day.

Also, this is probably the biggest one: Feeling ugh once i cum. When im horny/jacking off, i think ""i really wanna fuck this guy/this is hot/whatever"" then once i cum, BOOM it's completely gone. It turns into ""ugh what the heck? Why am i doing this? This is weird"" Then a few hours later im back to normal.

What do you guys think? Is it weird/a problem or do you all experience it too? If im not spcefic enough please say so.

So, me and my close friend (we'll call him T) have known each other for approximately 3 months now. He recently moved to my state where we matched on Tinder and started going on dates. Essentially, we were dating for around a month, were having sex and were getting pretty serious. Everything was perfect and I couldn't have been a happier guy--I felt like a met someone I truly care for.

Well, after a little over a month we sit down and he cuts the cord. ""I don't know what I want, you're a fantastic guy buy I've only been here a month or two."" ""You're not my usual type."" ""I'm not saying we can't date again later."" I was broken, but I slowly but surely moved on--I understand and respect his reasoning. *I* complicated the situation by still treating him as a boyfriend even after this which is my fault and I've corrected that behavior. But this began a lot of tension between T and I. We've gotten ourselves into this hate/love relationship.

So, we've gotten to a point now where we're pretty close. We're gym partners, we hangout on a daily basis, we go out every weekend. And this is where the actual problem began...

Last week he met a guy at the gay club we went to. Super nice guy, but definitely not someone I'd pin T to date/be with. We'll call him Q. The next day we all hang out again and I got Q's number, we were all getting along. Q has only been in my town for a few weeks now, so he expressed how he did not know anyone yet, so I wanted to befriend him and make him feel welcomed in T's circle of friends. When T saw me doing this, he was clearly upset, so I backed off. Later that night he called me to tell me how uncomfortable that made him feel for me to get his number. So I complied and backed further off.

It's been a week now and Q has joined us at the gym consecutively, and T spends most of his free time with Q now. I see the exact same patterns T followed with me now with Q. 

Last night, we all went out again (Q included) and this is the problem I'm facing now. Q, T, and I are all dancing together on the floor with one of our friends (a girl). T leaves to do something for a second, and Q gestures to me to come dance with him. Now, at this point I was afraid to do that, but thought *why the hell not, T can't get mad at two friends dancing.* Sure enough, after dancing for maybe 30 seconds with Q I look up and see the most fucked up stare/I want to kill you face from T. I stop immediately. At this point, T had pulled aside our mutual friend and was walking to the other side of the club. I follow them and thought maybe we were going to a bar downtown. T turns around to me and says ""What? Are you going to follow us? Why don't you go back to grinding with Q.""

Long story short, the rest of the night he was a complete asshole to me. If I were so much to look at Q or talk to him he would get visibly upset. This was especially difficult because I can tell Q likes to talk to me a lot, and he laughs at pretty much everything I say. Not helping.

Me and T plan to talk about it sometime today. This is my perspective...

I am fucking pissed. I've put T at the top of my list for months now to make sure he's integrating into our town. All of his friends are through me. I helped him look for apartments. I hung out with him anytime he wanted to. I treated him like *gold.* Even after we broke up and he started treating me like an ass. Hell, if I didn't convince him to come out last Friday, he wouldn't have found Q. He has the nerve to tote this guy around like a trophy, make out with him, and touch him right in front of me. Where he knows damn well it's going to bother me when he went through the same fucking routine with me.

Every time we've had arguments, I let him walk all over me. But I'm done with that because this time I think he's in the wrong. If he could act this way towards me because I danced with a guy he's known a week? Fuck him and his petty insecurities. I hope to communicate my frustration later today, just in a nicer way I guess. I just can't see how someone I would lay down everything for would hold such strong feelings of jealousy over nothing. I don't know what to do and I think we're both being dumb and stupid... I just need some advice.

I know we should just take a break from being around one another, the only problem is our gym routine has us meet everyday. Maybe just keep it to the gym for a while?

&lt;p&gt;In this situation, would you still do the chocolate, flowers, dinner gig? Would you get creative? Not do anything Valentine&amp;#39;s related and just do something romantic some other time? This is the first Valentine&amp;#39;s day that I won&amp;#39;t be &amp;quot;alone&amp;quot;, so I don&amp;#39;t know how to go about this. Thanks for the suggestions guys.&lt;/p&gt;

Since then, he deleted me from Facebook and never returned any of my texts. It sucked really bad when I found out about it, but as time passed I dealt with it. Today, I bumped into him on the street. I saw him approaching from a distance and he noticed me shortly afterwards. I wanted to ask him the reason why he stopped talking and if I did anything wrong (something I had already asked in my last text to him), but I just couldn't go through with it. Our exchange was something like this. 

Me: Greetings!

Him: How are things?

Me: Pretty good, what about you?

Him: Pretty good as well.

He, then, patted me on the arm and continued walking. For a while, all the negative thoughts stormed back into my brain, but I managed to keep it cool. I'm sure that, with time, it won't be much of a deal for me, but I think it's a really unfortunate situation. From what I've read, quite a lot of guys get the silent treatment after a while. If only we could respect each other like decent human beings and talk about our thoughts and feelings.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;A while back I posted a text about a guy who suddenly stopped communicating out of the blue.

A little over a year ago, I was browsing on one of the Me Monday threads, and saw a guy, who we'll call Greg, who was interested in trading Snapchats. I contacted him, and we chatted through there, which isn't easy, so we exchanged Kiks. After chatting there, we exchanged Instagrams, and eventually became Facebook friends. He convinced me to get Grindr, which I did so hesitantly, but it's been better than I anticipated.

Fast forward to this past August: he mentioned needing relationship advice, so we talked about it on the phone for a good while. It made me feel good that he trusted me enough to be asking about it all. 

Fast forward to November: I started a conversation via text, and I asked how his relationship world was. He told me he was dating a different (better) guy for over two months. I'm happy for him, but we had texted during that time, and he didn't mention it at all. All of the conversations we've had since September haven't been very fruitful. He hasn't initiated any conversations, and doesn't give much of a reply. 

I'm glad for his relationship, but I still want to be friends. We've never met in person, despite living in the same state, but since June, I've been about 1000 miles away. I'm not bothered by that at all. Am I overthinking this? If there's any more details you guys might think are necessary, let me know. 

Thanks in advance!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll provide as much background info as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

There's a guy at my job that I had seen around for forever, but it was only once he moved desks that he smiled at me one time in recognition and I smiled and waved back that we've been doing that every time we see each other ever since.

He works the day shift, 8am-4pm roughly, and I work afternoon/night shift which is 2pm-10pm so there's only a little overlap in the time we're at work at the same time and I can't spend a break with him or anything because the last break the day shift workers take is 2pm-2:30pm which is when I get there.

After smiling and waving to him every day as we walked past each other slowly became crushing on him super hard, I worked up the courage to talk to him yesterday right before he left. I introduced myself and told him my name and he told me his (which I already knew, thanks name placards at every cubicle) and then, like the nervous angsty child I am, I asked if he was leaving soon, which is  a pretty dumb question considering I already know the answer and it's only yes or no. He said yeah. He seemed distracted (he might have been in a hurry to leave) so I was just like ""well I'll see you around"" and smiled at him when he got up to leave a couple minutes later.

Without sounding too pessimistic, this kind of situation has happened to me before where I start crushing on a guy in my surroundings (school, work) and it goes downhill as I go crazy wondering whether he's interested in guys or if he's interested in me, and how to deal with getting to know him versus just taking the plunge and asking him out or something.

It's only been a day since our first ""conversation"", but I feel like for my peace of mind I should just leave him a note or something with my number and say something along the lines of ""Hey, it's /u/Shephards and I'm too shy to tell you think I really like you so I wanted to give you my phone number. No pressure or anything, and if you aren't gay I'm sorry for misreading things and hope you aren't insulted/offended.""

In the past I've always just let these things fall away after time so that's why I think maybe this time I should be upfront and direct with him. All I have to lose is smiling and waving to him every day I guess? I really need other opinions on this beside my straight friends that don't have predicaments like this, so help me, /r/askgaybros, you're my only hope.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since I was posting about it in the thread by &lt;a href=""/u/SmileAtMePlease""&gt;/u/SmileAtMePlease&lt;/a&gt; (wonderfully appropriate username) I thought I&amp;#39;d write about the whole story.&lt;/p&gt;
