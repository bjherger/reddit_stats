My boyfriend of 18 months and I got into our first argument last night while we talked on the way home from our respective jobs.  We are pretty lucky in that we both work the same schedule, and usually on our commutes home we'll talk about our day until one or the other of us gets home.  We're usually home within 15 minutes of each other.

He's worked at this big box retailer for nearly 3 years, and in the last 9 months or so, I've watched as his soul has been sucked from his once lively body.

Since a new store manager took over earlier this year, he has come home nearly every day bitching about his job.  Whether it's not hiring the right folks, not scheduling the right hours, not providing support, the manager hiding in the back office all day long, not writing folks up, not providing breaks, not having their trucks unloaded, not having stuff stocked in a timely manner... I could go on.  This new manager literally does nothing all day.

Well, this weekend is my boyfriend's birthday.  We both scheduled off on Friday and Monday for a nice long weekend.  We didn't necessarily have plans for either of those days, but we both really need time off, and some time in the outdoors.  

Turns out when my boyfriend went to work yesterday, his sorry manager didn't approve either of his days.  So, he's got to work while I'm off.  This is after already semi-promising to approve them if he'd come in this past Sunday for a few hours.

When he complains about his job, I listen.  I encourage where appropriate.  I offer advice.  I let him vent.  Most of all, I encourage him to find a job where he's not under the direct supervision of an idiot.  He's being wasted and being paid very little for his effort.

Part of my frustration is with him in that he is either unwilling or just doesn't want to find a new job OR push back on his manager in any meaningful way to make his current job better.  He just refuses to do so because he doesn't see it making a difference.  (And a new job will 'just have it's own set of problems'.)

What can I do?  I care deeply for him, and I absolutely hate seeing him so downtrodden behind this.  It also takes a lot for me to no keep harping on the same pieces of advice every time we talk about this.  I absolutely do not want to nag that a new job is needed, or he needs to step up to his manager.  

I also realize he's a grown ass man and is capable of making his own decisions, but damnit, I want him to be happy, and working in a job that pays him well enough and appreciates him.

tldr:  boyfriend has shitty job; refuses to do anything about it, OP is frustrated and wants to help without nagging, help!?

Everyone should know that I'm a writer, and as you know, when you choose to become a writer, making money as a working writer is a challenge. It's hard but not impossible. I fell in love almost two years ago, and he was my first boyfriend. I was deeply in love with this man, and things got difficult when I couldn't be hired as a writer because of my visa (I'm international). Point is: he dumped me by saying that he knew that he couldn't fall in love with a struggling artist. His next boyfriend was a very, very wealthy dude who was always getting him expensive presents (I knew all of this because of his Instagram). I was very depressed at the time. Also, I came out to my very conservative family and all three of them (mom, dad, sister) decide to tell me that being gay is a choice and that they won't support me. After that, I lost my job. I was like one hit after another. I burned through all of my savings, so I had to get a survival job as a cat sitter.
I was feeling incredibly suicidal, that was until I got my survival job. At one of the buildings I met a very cute guy. He was older and somewhat successful in my field. Please dear reader, keep in mind that I haven't gone on a date with anyone in almost a year (when you're dumped for being poor and replaced by a 1%er, your self-respect hits the ground pretty hard). I took a chance on this guy and we have an amazing first date. He also tells me that he's not looking for a boyfriend right now (which is fine, I thought: hey! we might have a fun time and see where this goes).
He asks me out on a second date and says that having sex while being high on Ecstasy is fun, so he says that we should do that on our second date. He says I'm really handsome, and funny and that he wants me to spend the night at his place . He wants to cuddle and get to know me better. I was counting the hours for this second date (sex while being on E with a gorgeous guy? fuck yeah!)
We met, and we go to his place and we take the pill. Also, don't forget I've been really depressed lately. The pill kicks in and he decides to tell me that he's not looking for a boyfriend because he's engaged to a guy younger than me, and that he's leaving the country to marry him and he's coming back in the last week of september with his new husband. It was my first time on E, and then he asks about my family, and I start to rant and rant. I also tell this stranger I was feeling suicidal, and how much my ex hurt me. I pretty much told my darkest secrets to this handsome stranger. At 2 am, he says to me that his tolerance level is up and that he's done with me. He's mad we didn't get to have sex so he kicked me out of his house like I was a dirty dog. I felt like crap, BUT I don't feel suicidal anymore (which is great! I'm so thankful to this guy about that! I even called him and thanked him about it!). My short film just got into a film festival, and I took a short trip, but now I have to go back to my cat sitting reality, and this guy who humiliated me and judged me is coming back with his husband, and I'm going to feel like shit. It's going to be so humiliating for me because it's like he gets to have his cake and eat it in front of me, and that's just life... I guess.
I don't know what to do. I really want to quit this job, but I need the money until I find something else, and now, the last thing I should tell is that... I don't trust men anymore. I want a new relationship and all, but I just don't want to try again because I know the guy is going to be mean to me... and I don't know how to handle this situation... any feedback would mean the world to me.
thank you!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone, I really need advice with my life or feelings right now. Everyone should know that I&amp;#39;m a writer, and as you know, when you choose to become a writer, making money as a working writer is a challenge. It&amp;#39;s hard but not impossible. I fell in love almost two years ago, and he was my first boyfriend. I was deeply in love with this man, and things got difficult when I couldn&amp;#39;t be hired as a writer because of my visa (I&amp;#39;m international). Point is: he dumped me by saying that he knew that he couldn&amp;#39;t fall in love with a struggling artist. His next boyfriend was a very, very wealthy dude who was always getting him expensive presents (I knew all of this because of his Instagram). I was very depressed at the time. Also, I came out to my very conservative family and all three of them (mom, dad, sister) decide to tell me that being gay is a choice and that they won&amp;#39;t support me. After that, I lost my job. I was like one hit after another. I burned through all of my savings, so I had to get a survival job as a cat sitter.
