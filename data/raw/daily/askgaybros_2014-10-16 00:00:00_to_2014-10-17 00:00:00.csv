I've been with my current partner for close to 5 years now. It's not always been peaches and cream but whenever there is a problem in our relationship we are both open and will discuss the problem and work toward viable solutions. Both of us have our faults but those have never stopped us from being together and I feel like we have a deep love for each other based on understanding and companionship. Well all except for this problem.

My partner is a severe hyperchondriac and has serious anxiety issues that he won't seek help for. I'm studying to be a nurse and worked in a mental hospital for quite awhile so I'm usually able to help him with this and talk him through his anxiety, but being in the field that I'm in does no favors for his hyperchondria. He gets achy at times and thinks that he has cancer or appendicitis (our friend recently had appendicitis so he's now constantly worried about it). It gets to the point where he will convince himself that he is sick but due to his family history he is afraid to see a doctor and receive treatment for anything unless I physically take him and reassure him the entire time. He has several trigger words pertaining to his current health conditions that will cause him to have full blown panic attacks (namely sleep apnea) and if I do talk him through the attack he still refuses any kind of non-invasive treatment.

The point being is that I don't feel like I can go and do other things for extended periods of time. I recently helped one of our friends move to another state and happened to take a flight back that routed me through Atlanta and he was afraid I might have caught Ebola. I also learned from my roommate that he did an intense amount of cleaning while I was gone; this was alarming because he never cleans, I always do the cleaning around the house. 

This problem that he has with hyperchondria and anxiety has gone well past the range that routine therapy alone can fix. He needs medication to deal with his anxiety and he needs someone qualified to help him through his hyperchondria when I'm not there. I knew he was a hyperchondriac when we first started seeing each other, and I also knew about the anxiety but back then they were both manageable. Now it has gotten to the point where if I leave he is having mild panic attacks because he's afraid I might die.

I feel so powerless now. I feel like I'm failing him as his partner, and even worse, I feel like my predominant form of work can't even help him. I'm out of options for the both of us in this regard. I can't change him because that would be both impossible and contradictory to a sustainable relationship. It breaks my heart to see the love of my life suffering in this way and it greatly troubles me to even consider giving him ultimatums on this situation.

The point is that I need to find a way convince my partner to help himself in these matters and I don't know how bring up any of his trigger phrases in a way that allows him to work past his fears. I'm at the end of my rope and it's a long drop down. I can't give up on him but I also can't stand to see him suffer.

You need to stop thinking I still have that desire to ""try to do anything"" with you.  Don't flatter yourself.  Besides, your head's already far up your ass so it would be difficult anyway.

I did my part and admitted my wrongdoing.

I was nothing but a guy of convenience to you, your chauffeur, your lackey, your servant.  This wasn't what I was looking for.

Anyway, we've been seeing eachother every two weeks since then, and usually just end up fooling around.

My feelings for him have stayed the same, I'm still in love with him, I still really care about him.

Last week he hooked up with another guy, he told me yesterday, I freaked out even though we aren't dating and shouldn't have a reason. But it was a blow to me, I can't help my feelings for him, and it just felt like I got punched in the stomach. We dated eachother for two years so this is warranted feelings in my opinion.

Ok so today, I took the day off work because I was up all last night being a whiny little bitch feeling sorry for myself. He messages me to come over after he finds out I took the day off, we hook up again, he listens to my ramblings about how I still love him...etc, he answers some questions about the guy he fooled around with...etc.

Tonight we start talking online again, I ask him what he thought today was...etc, he told me he was just horny. I sort of got mad at him because he knows I have feelings for him, he knows that I've been holding onto the fact that we will get back together; he gave me this impression and was implicit about it. I've been going to therapy sessions for him.....etc, all so I can just be a more level headed person.

So what the hell do you guys think I should do. He's admitted he doesn't love me, he says he still wants to maybe get back together, he doesn't want me to leave his life, he's sleeping with other guys, he' ssleeping with me. 

I'm a fucking moron aren't I for doing all this? Should I just leave, I fucking love this guy and really can't help my feelings, I just have very little experience with relationships, and honestly when I entered this one I never thought I would actually love someone, I really didn't know what it meant, but it is fucking tearing me to fucking pieces right now.

I'm afraid of being alone, ha I just need some fucking support.

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, we&amp;#39;ve been seeing eachother every two weeks since then, and usually just end up fooling around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My feelings for him have stayed the same, I&amp;#39;m still in love with him, I still really care about him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week he hooked up with another guy, he told me yesterday, I freaked out even though we aren&amp;#39;t dating and shouldn&amp;#39;t have a reason.

I had a girlfriend (21) for the last 3 months. Before that, I was never in a relationship, and decided to test out whether I was in fact, gay. I wanted to see if I would be emotionally attracted to a female and that's when I met a girl at a bar through mutual friends. She seemed to like me and I did too (probably just as a friend/out of curiosity). I know this is wrong, I made a mistake. I didn't know if I was gay or not at this point, so we went out.

It was fucking horrible, and I had to go along with it. After that, I realized that I should tell her the right way, I didn't think she'd take it bad, but she did, which i understand.

I wanted to tell her before my family because I felt bad that she invested so much time and it would be the right thing to do. At the same time, I also realized that she was incredibly homophobic. She kicked me, screamed, called me a disgusting faggot, cried and left. I tried calling her, left her a lengthy text apologizing as best as i could. No response.

He's quirky, weird, really fun to be around. Whenever the club gets together (only been two weeks) we pretty much hang out together side-by-side. We're both socially awkward so there's not much talking until alcohol's involved, although we probably wouldn't be dependant on the stuff for long.

I find him really cute, and he does flirt a lot when we talk - I'll say 'fuck you' jokingly, and he'll say 'wait till we're back at my place', but of course that won't happen. He also dances and poses seductively a lot for me, as I said - quirky lol. Whenever I feel things going anywhere though, he'll either just shut it down or ignore me, or even walk away to 'the bathroom' or whatever. Sorry if I'm explaining this weird, still a little drunk and... awkward lol.

I've always believed in the 'if he's the one, you'll both know' philosophy, but I'm very inexperienced with this stuff. It really hurts when he turns down my advances like he has no interest, after messing around for a while. On the other hand, when I 'ignore' him he comes running to find me.

The past few years have been hard for my family. Four years ago my dad's mom passed away from pneumonia. My older brother took his own life 2 years ago on New Years. My mom's mom passed away in July, and tomorrow is my mom's final service and burial.

I'm doing pretty well considering I'm laying my mom down to rest tomorrow afternoon. She was suffering from a good amount of pain for a while after her first stroke 2 years ago.

I'm okay with her leaving; it was for the best. But I'm saddened that I couldn't see her once more this year. The last time I spoke to her was 2 days before she left, and I promised her I'd visit - parents live in LA, I in New Jersey - by Christmas. I was going to visit after I go to South Carolina to care for my sister and her new born daughter.

I just can't help but feel that I should have tried harder to visit and call her more often. 

I'm 24, but I've already lost half of my immediate family. Has anyone else lost loved ones early in life? What advice do you have? Thanks","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m okay with her leaving; it was for the best. But I&amp;#39;m saddened that I couldn&amp;#39;t see her once more this year. The last time I spoke to her was 2 days before she left, and I promised her I&amp;#39;d visit - parents live in LA, I in New Jersey - by Christmas. I was going to visit after I go to South Carolina to care for my sister and her new born daughter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just can&amp;#39;t help but feel that I should have tried harder to visit and call her more often. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m 24, but I&amp;#39;ve already lost half of my immediate family. Has anyone else lost loved ones early in life? What advice do you have? Thanks&lt;/p&gt;

My partner and I are each other's first same sex significant other.  We were best friends, that evolved into more, and now we are happily partnered, living together, planning our futures together.  It feels incredibly right.

Since we both had only had relationships with girls before each other, we never really had any sexual experience with other guys.  My partner has suggested things like threesomes, etc, and while I don't think I'm ready for that yet, I think I could be willing to expiriment a little in the future (read years, not weeks or even months).

For anyone in a successful long term relationship that has an open element, how do you make it work?  How do you deal with jealousy?  I guess my main concern is the feeling that I'm not ""enough"" sexually, which leads to feelings of inadequacy.  Also, the misdirection of my partner's sexual feeling or affection towards someone else is a feeling I'm not ready to deal with.

It isn't like this is an imminent pressure or concern, I'm just trying to be proactive.  Please no ""your partner is an asshole"", etc, comments, because he isn't.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey gaybros,&lt;/p&gt;
