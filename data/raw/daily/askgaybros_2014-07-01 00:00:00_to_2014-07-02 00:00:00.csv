Regardless, sometimes I think taking a ride on the Craigslist/Grindr coaster, having some fun and being done with it, would probably open myself to being a lot more…well…open in general.

&lt;p&gt;tl;dr - So, wet dream, is this normal? And is anyone else this confused about what they enjoy sexually?&lt;/p&gt;

I have been dating this guy for a little over two years now and aside from the normal ups and downs that every relationship goes through a third party observer would assume everything was going well. We moved across the country together and had no problems planning out big trips to take many months in advance. However, the reality is that even though I didn't feel like the relationship was lacking anything, I made some horrid decisions to have random hookups using Grindr 7-10 different times during the relationship and then tried to erase it from my memory/live in denial and go back to the guy I was dating. I already know I'm the worst fucking person in the world for doing it, but in a sick twisted way I never meant to ruin my relationship with this guy. I tried to have both a promiscuous lifestyle and a relationship at the same time. I know it was a lie I told myself that something like this could even be possible, but it continued...

Approximately a month ago the guy I was dating picked up my phone and I still had screenshots of Grindr conversations in my gallery I had with these random guys that I would use to get off occasionally. We had a falling out that lasted a good while before I was able to calm him down after telling him I only got on to get off to the conversations I would have with these people and never met up with (Knowing that this was a complete lie and really only to try to spare the feelings of this guy who in my head I never really consciously wanted to hurt.) Later that night after I had came to realization that if I truly cherished this relationship like I said I did I would never bring myself to ever do anything like this again and had gone to bed, he downloaded a program that allowed him to bring up all those deleted text conversations to the surface and then it was all out on the table so to speak. We stayed up most of the night talking back and forth. I was trying everything I could to try and explain that despite the horrid acts I committed that I really did still love him and that I would do anything in the world for a shot in rebuilding that trust that was shattered that night. Into the next day he was absolute in his decision that we were over, and after I finally broke down out of my denial and realized the harm I've caused and that there was no chance of ever saving this relationship, he saw something that made him want to say that if I really valued this relationship and I could prove to him and myself that I can really change, he said we could start over from the beginning. 

I cried so hard after that moment saying that I don't deserve a second chance and that you shouldn't even want to be with me after the pain I've caused you, but I was completely ready to do all I could do to make this right and prove our connection was not a lie. 

A few times since then he would regress and tell me how much he hated me for doing that to him and I would do everything I could to calm him down and patiently wait for him to throw everything at me because I knew I deserved every second of it. I would attempt to reassure him that I have changed for him and that I have no desire to put our relationship at risk again. 

Fast-forward to this past week. We both had a vacation planned back to our home state where we would be physically 4 hours apart for most of the visit. He flew out of the city we live the day before I did so that night I had the apartment to myself. Because I did legitimately used those conversations to get off in the past I thought I could try something out that would distance myself from getting physically involved with someone aside from this guy, something I swore up and down to him that would never happen again. So I read posts on the personals section of Craigslist just hoping to read something that satisfied me. I even went as far as to make a post on my own just to read the replies I would receive. Aside from the basic stuff most of these types of ads had, there was nothing linking me personally to this post. I never uploaded a picture to this ad partially because I honestly didn't want any suitable responses. About 10-15 minutes passes and I start to realize that even this is getting dangerously close to the type of behavior I was partaking in and I decide that it was for the best to just delete the email address I used to receive the responses from this post. I then just downloaded a porn video, did my business, packed for my upcoming trip, and called it a night. 

There were a few times during the trip that he told me while we were apart that he could now never forgive me for what I have done and that he assumed I was just hooking up with people while we were apart (this was most certainly not the case as up to this moment I have been truthful to him that I have not even wanted to start that behavior again), but after long sms conversations or a phone call, things somewhat returned to normal in a way and we were both excited to see one another again to finish off this vacation apart.

Now we arrive at last night. After what started like another regression that we had been able to work through in the past month, he remembered the email address that I had never really used in the past, but that I had used for the Craigslist posting before deleting it our first night apart. After I attempted to stall him or change his mind and I was about to have the account reactivated and the inbox restored, I told me what he would find in that account. Replies of people from the Craigslist ad I posted were there, but I had never responded to any of them and deleted the email account quite quickly that first night.

This is when things got bad really quick. He used this as his proof that I was the exact same person I was and that I was not committed to making this work and that he was done ever giving me a second chance because in his opinion, I had already blew it. I tried to explain that my only intention was trying to get that thrill of reading sexual replies that someone else wrote without actually being involved with anyone, physically or contact back and forth online. This time my attempts to get him to see that I do in fact care about him have fallen on deaf ears. It got to the point last night that he punched me in the arm which was the first act of physically aggression we've ever had. 

I know I don't deserve for this guy to ever take me back, and I will hate myself for the rest of my life for what I have done to the person I cared most about. He says that the deleted email account is evidence that I haven't changed, but I opened the account to show him that there was never a reply send out to any message I received. He doesn't believe me and I can understand completely why he wouldn't believe me based on what happened. Am I a complete monster for thinking that I still have kept my word to him and that he is overreacting to the email account? Am I still in denial that I can ever do anything to prove to him that I do care so much about him in the hopes of our relationship being saved? Or does it seem that I have messed up my only shot at redemption with this guy? 

My apologies for such a long post and I'll appreciate any feedback I can get. Thanks so much.

In my first post here, I would like your sincere opinion on this matter: I'm a closeted bi with a small circle of friends, all male. Said friends suggested a short camping trip next week. The thing is, I worry that something may happen there that will trigger an excited (you get me) or a weirdo reaction by me. I don't think they have even thought about the possibility I'm bi, and lately I find myself getting excited really easily. Finding out should be destructive in many ways, for me foremost. I've stayed with other friends in the past, but nothing happened because I was cautious and they were really non-provoking in any way, something that I can't say about these (see: masturbating and being nude in my view). What should I do? Please, no hate, looking for sincere and well-spoken answers. I would be glad to elaborate if asked.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello there.

I was in a bad relationship all on his part, but all I can think of is him.  I hate him and I know all the garbage he put me through would make anyone leave. But I let him stay... and now its affecting my mental and physical health.  

I can no longer stay sane because random thoughts and images of him come into my head. It sucks because my active imagination starts running and it wont stop and I end up crying because of remembering all the pain and suffering I had to go through to be with him.

I've tried talking to people, but it doesn't work. My only outlet towards all this is running and working out and I can't do this everyday because my whole body is sore still from all the excessive workouts I have done.  It sucks that the anger comes and goes without warning.

I can't sleep because I subconsciously think of him and start crying and start getting angry at myself for being with someone like him, I can't eat because I lost all appetite and it feels disgusting to eat. Its like eating bland food and force feeding myself until I get nauseous.

Theres just nothing I can do to forget him and work on myself in peace... I just want it to end it sucks so bad.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do you get over your ex? &lt;/p&gt;
