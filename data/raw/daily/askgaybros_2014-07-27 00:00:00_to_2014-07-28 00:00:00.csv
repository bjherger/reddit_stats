I'm 23 and I've always wanted a relationship since as far as I  can recall.
I'm not an online-app type of person. I tried a couple of time, it just didn't work out, it's awkward, the other guys make their intentions unclear, they just want sex etc. I believe I'm more comfortable with building something with somebody I see daily in a natural environment, with whom I'll become friend and eventually get closer. This is kind of hard to achieve with Apps since we have two unrelated individuals who starts building something from the ground. To me it always felt forced in a way.

Which made me put faith into life fate and random encounters... Which is what cause some issues for me. Doing so often result in a punch in the face of the fact we, homosexuals, are a minority.

At first, when I came out (6 years ago) and started to explore life, I was fine when I met randomly an interesting and good-looking guy (party, bar, friend's friends, school) who turned out to be straight. But years later, it's starting to make me very depressive. I've met more interesting* straight guys in 6 years out of the closet than gay, and I don't do that on purpose. 

^*When ^I ^say ^interesting, ^I ^mean ^both ^the ^personality ^and ^the ^physic, ^common ^interests, ^good ^caring ^personality, ^etc.

And when I meet a gay guy randomly at places mentioned above (which is rare), he turns out not being of my taste. But when the guy's is good enough and has potential, it turns out he's straight. I'm bound to see my girl friends being flirted by good guys in my face and see them friendzone really good guys whereas I'm stuck in the limbo of ""where the F are my possibilities"". It makes me feel I'll have to reduce my (already not that high) standards or content myself with what I get instead of getting what I want.

Which reduces my options to either try harder online, which isn't good for me, hang in there (which sometime makes me depressive) OR go in a ""fully gay-themed"" areas, which has proven me to not be more efficient or that good.

So. How do you deal with this?

I haven't told a single soul about this and I think this would be the only way I could do it and it would help me to move on....

He was my first love, my first kiss, and I was his too. and I couldn't get the courage to tell him that he was the first one to break my heart. I cut him off from my life (deleted/blocked his number, unfriended on facebook, moved to another city) but it still sucks how I couldn't stop thinking of him until now even when it's been months since we last spoke. I love him but he doesn't love me back. typical unrequited love. We didn't really have any closure. We just stopped talking to each other, and I would just look the other way and pretend I didn't see him when our paths cross

We were roommates back on our first year of college and initially, I really didn't feel anything at all for him and just wanted to be friends because I think he's cool. I was an international student and he moved in from out of state. The first time we met, I really didn't feel anything for him, and I just thought he could be a cool friend since we both love playing video games and I'm a huge dork.

A few months after living together, I started to notice how he always crosses my mind. I couldn't stop thinking about him and how I feel funny whenever we're in each other's presence. What made things worse was that we shared the same room and our beds face each other, allowing me to conveniently look at him every time I wake up. I had a feeling he was looking at me too. Maybe I fell in love with how he looks when he sleeps. I think I have the tendency to fall for the ones I feel could use my protection / someone I could care for. And it certainly didn't help how he always faces me in the morning. This continued for months and within those times, I felt that he feels something for me too. I kept on telling myself it was just me reading between the lines and hoping that he feels the same way but there were moments where I see him taking a glance at me and catch him and his friend (who is a girl) talk about me. I knew he was gay, but he's trying to hide it. I think I was attracted to his feminine qualities and physical traits and I use to fantasize how he turns out to be a girl in the end and we hit it off from there... (ik, creepy..)

I wished I didn't make that move. It was so cheesy I never thought it would happen in real life. It was morning and I was still in bed when we caught each other's eyes and smiled, he threw a shirt at me, I threw it back and it led to him pulling off my blanket and me wrestling him to my bed and pinning him under me and we ended up making out furiously. It was magic and my heart was pounding so hard I never thought it was possible. I had this strong feeling that what were doing was wrong and it would never work out but it was replaced with how I'm willing to sacrifice things for him and how I am in love with him.

He told me that what happened between us shouldn't happen again and I agreed because it was pointless. but it continued for almost a year, although less frequent, even when we were no longer roommates. During those times, I made an effort to get to know him better, tried asking him to go out with me and he made it clear that he doesn't feel the same... I kept on trying to move on but every time he asks me to come over, I would because I wanted to be with him. It was confusing and I really don't know what to make of it. We were each others firsts and we handled it badly.

Before the summer break of last year, we sort of ended things. He told me I will find someone who was nice to me and would love me back, and I hoped it was true. I never initiated contact with him and I started seeing this really nice girl who I started to like and also likes me back. But he was always in the back of my mind and he would sometimes contact me and we would play video games together. This made me think about him more and look forward to seeing each other again.. I ended up not seeing the girl anymore, telling her I wasn't really over someone else and it was unfair how I still think about him when I'm with her. I didn't tell her it was with the guy. We go to the same school and we have mutual friends. I haven't told anyone about him but he told his friends about me. What hurts is that he tells me his friends want me out of his life and they want him to cut me off. I did the job for him after we stopped contacting each other.

Everytime we see each other at school I just automatically switch on this air of indifference, I start to shut down and feel numb and not really look at him. In the end I regret this. I want some closure because I'm still hurting and I still think about him every single day without fail. I think he's one of the main reasons why I moved to another city. I want to forget him but it sucks how my life still revolves around me thinking about whether he cared about me at all...

This is confusing and I just want to move on but I can't.. :((

&lt;p&gt;I wished I didn&amp;#39;t make that move. It was so cheesy I never thought it would happen in real life. It was morning and I was still in bed when we caught each other&amp;#39;s eyes and smiled, he threw a shirt at me, I threw it back and it led to him pulling off my blanket and me wrestling him to my bed and pinning him under me and we ended up making out furiously. It was magic and my heart was pounding so hard I never thought it was possible. I had this strong feeling that what were doing was wrong and it would never work out but it was replaced with how I&amp;#39;m willing to sacrifice things for him and how I am in love with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He told me that what happened between us shouldn&amp;#39;t happen again and I agreed because it was pointless. but it continued for almost a year, although less frequent, even when we were no longer roommates. During those times, I made an effort to get to know him better, tried asking him to go out with me and he made it clear that he doesn&amp;#39;t feel the same... I kept on trying to move on but every time he asks me to come over, I would because I wanted to be with him. It was confusing and I really don&amp;#39;t know what to make of it. We were each others firsts and we handled it badly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the summer break of last year, we sort of ended things. He told me I will find someone who was nice to me and would love me back, and I hoped it was true. I never initiated contact with him and I started seeing this really nice girl who I started to like and also likes me back. But he was always in the back of my mind and he would sometimes contact me and we would play video games together. This made me think about him more and look forward to seeing each other again.. I ended up not seeing the girl anymore, telling her I wasn&amp;#39;t really over someone else and it was unfair how I still think about him when I&amp;#39;m with her. I didn&amp;#39;t tell her it was with the guy. We go to the same school and we have mutual friends. I haven&amp;#39;t told anyone about him but he told his friends about me. What hurts is that he tells me his friends want me out of his life and they want him to cut me off. I did the job for him after we stopped contacting each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everytime we see each other at school I just automatically switch on this air of indifference, I start to shut down and feel numb and not really look at him. In the end I regret this. I want some closure because I&amp;#39;m still hurting and I still think about him every single day without fail. I think he&amp;#39;s one of the main reasons why I moved to another city. I want to forget him but it sucks how my life still revolves around me thinking about whether he cared about me at all...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is confusing and I just want to move on but I can&amp;#39;t.. :((&lt;/p&gt;
