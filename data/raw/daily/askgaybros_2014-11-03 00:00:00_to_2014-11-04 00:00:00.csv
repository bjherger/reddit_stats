I’ll start out by saying that I am have an INTJ personality type. Relationships are my Achilles heel, and I tend to over-analyze things and read too deeply into these sorts of situations. I also apologize for the length! I hope the sections help.

Some background: I just turned 23, he's almost 22. We both work and go to school. I'm pretty introverted and have a small group of friends, whereas he has an enormous social circle.

**The Beginning**

I’m trying to understand the perspective of this guy I’m into. We met for the first time two months ago. Our first month was fantastic. We had been seeing each other about once a week before he started this new job.

**The Issue**

On two occasions I made plans to see him, and he cancelled because he got stuck at work (new job). Plus our hours are different. We used to hang on weeknights, and we haven’t been able to with his new hours. The second time he canceled, I showed up and he wasn’t there. He was still at work, and he didn’t call me ahead of time to let me know he couldn’t make it. I was very upset, and he felt terrible. I told him I was concerned he didn’t want to keep seeing me, or that he wasn’t ready for something real because he couldn’t make time for me.

**The Confusion**

As I told him this in my frustration, he asked if I wanted him to leave me alone. I told him I didn’t want him to, and he was relieved to hear that. He reassured me that he likes me, but that he is afraid he doesn’t fit with how much I want to see him and talk to him. He has a lot going on, but so do I. He sees that I like him a lot, and he didn’t think it would be fair to me that I can’t see him as much as I’d like to. He also explained that he’s a little afraid of dating. His past couple relationships have been roller coaster rides, both very good and very bad. But, he explained that he gets nothing but good vibes from me.

The next day he invited me over. We went for a walk by a lake. Then we sat in his car talking and listening to music all night, and we finished the evening with wonderful sex. It seemed to be his way of showing me that he wants me to stay, even though he knows he can’t always see me.

**The Waiting**

This was three weeks ago. For various reasons, things keep preventing us from seeing each other on weekends. He had plans with old friends this weekend in another city, last weekend he had to crunch to finish homework, and the weekend before that I was sick. 

He still calls me once a day or every few days, and we'll talk for maybe 20 minutes or so. He’s also pursuing a better job where he will have flexible hours to work around his classes.

We also decided that we should make plans well in advance to see each other. Last week, we decided to set aside a day this coming weekend to see each other.

**The Lingering Doubt**

He called me last night while he was visiting his friends. I helped him deal with a personal problem that arose during his visit. We talked for half an hour, then he went back to talk to his friends. They had been complaining to him that he was on his phone the whole day.

A while after we hung up, I texted him saying I wished I could talk to him in person. I also told him that I missed him.

I haven’t heard anything back from him, and I’m caught in this train of thought that he doesn’t want anything too serious with me.

If you care about someone, and you haven’t seen him in 3 weeks, wouldn’t you tell him that you miss him? And what does it say when you don’t get a response when you say that?

Maybe there's something else he's dealing with. Maybe he has more homework that needs done (he's very focused about school). I could make any number of excuses for him. But my doubt is still there because he hasn't said ""I miss you too.""

**The Path Forward**

I think I should wait a few days to let him get back to me. It would be refreshing if he called and offered his thoughts on what to do this weekend, or conveyed that he's excited to see me.

I don't want to keep texting him either. 

Is it best to do nothing?

As always, any help is much appreciated, bros.

I am a clothing/fashion fetishist and I have found myself noticing certain trends in clothing and overall appearance, some of which frustrate me. I just wanted to see if I was the only one that notices this kind of stuff and the views from you guys to correct me if I'm wrong or to generally contribute your thoughts.

Firstly: Tight clothing. It seems like in general, it's frowned upon to wear looser clothing except athletic shorts or trackpants, and that if you don't wear fairly tight stuff, that you get passed over. This is especially prevalant with skinnier guys who are seemingly expected to wear skinny jeans and form fitting shirts and that anything else is seemingly deemed ""sloppy"" as if the guy didn't get the right size stuff at the store. Straight guys however seem to have a social authorisation to wear a lot of the baggier/looser stuff no problem.

Secondly: Street Casual Style. From my observations in seeing guys on the street and throughout the Internet, that a lot of teenagers have nice style when it comes to their choice of casual clothing but when one hits their early-to-mid 20s, that so many guys stop paying attention to their casual style and often just go with whatever's around, often resulting in some generic form-fitting jeans that look faded and a shirt that looks like it's been worn too much.

Thirdly: Choice of Underwear. It seems like at least from my observations, that straight guys have again, the social authorization to wear loose boxers no problem. But for bi and gay guys, that there seems to be an expectation to wear briefs, boxerbriefs or something kinky (or nothing at all), something that shows off the package. If you're straight and sag a touch as a straight guy and your boxers flare out a bit, it's seen as sexy, but if you're bi/gay, it seems like you're not doing your part to show off enough since your boxers are 'covering up details' and not being sexy — in fact I have heard some who describe boxers as sloppy. It's difficult to find anyone these days who wears loose boxers who's bi/gay or anyone who appreciates boxers and sees them as sexy.

Fourth and finally: Long Hair. It seems that there is almost a force against guys having long hair that is pushed forth by both the world at large and indeed the gay community. It seems regardless of how well kept a guy keeps their long hair, that there's always a crowd demanding ""cut it, it isn't manly"", or ""cut it, only women have long hair"" or ""it's ugly"" or something despite having hair that is often complimented by women. Again, in an area where teenagers do it better, it seems like that many of them have a tousled hairstyle that is thick and lush, but when one hits their 20s, that many men almost start going down to military short.

So yeah, I just want to put this out there and hope that I can at least be corrected to an extent, because frankly, it seems if a guy wants to be stylish in their mid 20s, it seems that only a snappy business-casual look, with short hair works along with tight underwear being the only option to be seen as a sexy partner in bed.

I want to know why it seems that many guys as teens have snappy, vibrant style that is full of energy, while when one hits 20, one has to throw all of that away and adopt a stereotypically male appearance to be seen as attractive.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;

However, I try to be as safe as possible. I always use condoms during sex and would never even think about doing bareback unless I was in a monogamous, committed and trusting relationship. 

Unfortunately, I got gonorrhea a few weeks ago. Like I said, I've always used condoms, so my doctor told me that the person who passed it on to me likely had it in his throat and transmitted it through oral sex (so, let that be a lesson to everyone that oral isn't always safe). 

Since then my hypochondria has kicked in. Every time I notice something weird going on with my body I think I have HIV. Sore throat? HIV. Feeling tired today? HIV. Weird pimple? Definitely HIV.

Over the past few weeks I've developed a bad case of dry, itchy skin that's driving me crazy. I purposely avoided self diagnosis online but I broke down last night and checked webmd- and surprise! Apparently itchy skin can be an early symptom of HIV. The rational side of me knows it's much more likely to be an effect of cold weather, or perhaps a new cheap laundry detergent I just bought, or the fact that I'm using minoxodil which is known to cause itching. But the hypochondriac is convinced that it's HIV.

I'm sick of feeling this way. It makes me terrified to ever have sex again. I'm thinking back on all of my sexual experiences and second guessing whether I was as safe as I could have been, and at times it feels like the only option is to just be celibate for the rest of my life. And yes, I was tested back in July and was negative, and I'm getting tested again this week (I'm terrified). But I know I'll go back to being paranoid the very next time I have sex with someone.

I don't even know if I'm looking for solid advice, I just wanted to rant and see if anyone else feels this way. But if you have any advice I would love to hear it.

Some how a couple of weeks ago I end up dancing with a guy I kind of know and we are having a pretty fun time. We were dancing very close and there was a lot of contact, but it didn't go any further. I didn't think much about it but a week later I am a party and this guy's friend is there and he says how the guy (who he says he thinks is straight but has doubts) I was dancing with said I came onto him and that it freaked him out. Obviously this annoyed me as we were dancing with each other and I would never try anything with a guy who wasn't interested, if he wasn't interested he would have left yet he implies to his friend that it was just me who came onto him. As pissed off as I was I tried to move on and forget about him..

So last night I go out with friends and see the guy I danced with at the club again, he is on his own but he smiles at me and keeps following my group of friends around and looking at me, he speaks to me and he is quite friendly however I was still annoyed about what he said to his friend so I didn't chat for too long, but he still kept following me around the club.

Now I don't know what to do about him, he was really nice when he spoke to me in the club and he is an attractive guy, but he still was rude about me to his friend. I don't know if he is straight but just a bit weird, or gay and doesn't want his friend to know about it..

What do you guys think I should do, should I ask him if he is gay or just try and ignore him?

He's 31 and not out and I'm 27 and very much out. We hadn't had but one argument until after we got back from an NYC trip in July and he and my best friend (friend 1) were at each other's throats, I was pissed at both and vented to a friend (friend 2) not on the trip with us. (This is a bit rambling but this is important later.)

After NYC, he said things were moving too fast, and they were. I agreed to slow things down and we did. This was a giant fight, that I can even remember all the details of now.  Anyway, I was being moody because of my bad job and he wasn't being patient.  This is his biggest (I want to say only, but that's a lie) flaw - jumping the gun when someone acts like an ass or he feels slighted.

Only a few stupid arguments in three months but I keep asking for him to cool it when he gets a bit melodramatic about something small - he is legitimately working on it and the argument before last was more of a discussion than anything. Things have been going great; I have a new job, car, etc. and we've been doing all sorts of fun stuff, making memories.

The ""discussion"" was me excluding him from things. He felt he was clingy sometimes but I just did what I felt like - that I didn't invite him out with my friends and he feels left out of the quality time.  I said that I didn't see it that way but I had stopped inviting him to things because it didn't mesh with his work schedule and as a conscious effort to ""cool things off"" since the relationship had been moving to fast (for mostly him).  I said I would make sure to include him more often or at least extend the offer.

Last weekend, we go to King's Island together and are having a great time - until my friend who meet us there decides to say something along the lines of what was said in confidence (the spend more time together).  This made him think that I had told that friend what was said.  That sucks but I had upset him over a month earlier when the same friend brought up the NYC blowout - my BF asked me how did he know, I told him the truth, I texted while in NYC to vent about how stupid the BF and friend 1 were being.  BF asks what friend 2 was also told, I tell him the truth and said some sex stuff. The BF was not happy about that - I said it was brought up by friend 2 who was complaining and said, ""but you don't have those problems"" and I corrected him.  I thought it was fine, two very good friends talking about our respective relationships.

So,the BF thinks that I went back on my word, to not share so much to friend 2 about him. So he starts acting out at the park. Last hour we're there. I try to ask what's up - I had no clue.  I text him ""If you're going to act that way, let's leave.""  He was embarrassing the both of us. That makes him act out more - ""Let's leave then, I'm done."" I was PISSED.  We get to the car, which he didn't say anything during the walk, I just flatly ask ""What the hell is wrong with you?"" You start acting out and none of us know why.""  He then says that I told friend 2 what was not to be shared.

Big fight, conversation. I tell him that basically he called me a liar, I apologized for the two things I told friend 2 long ago. Venting about NYC, not sorry about, I had no one to talk to and my two companions were killing me and at each other (friend 1 instigated BTW, which is something not out of character, but the BF made worse); sex, totally sorry about. I said the same thing again, but his outburst that lasted over an hour was uncalled for and the subtext of me a liar was too much.  He started in about ""As close as I am with my friends, I would never tell them..."" I stupidly replied, ""You're not even fucking out to them! You don't get to use, 'As close as I am' in any rebuttal regarding what you tell your so-called 'friends'."" Yeah, I was a dick.

So, awkward ride home. I wasted $70 on an event the next day, that we couldn't attend because we drove home at 2 am and slept all day the next. I was ready for a full-blown breakup that morning and packed my stuff. I was upset and I had pissed him off.  Nothing happened he just got depressed and kept apologizing to me and texted friend 2 that morning.

Fast forward to this Saturday morning, he says that he thinks we should break up.  He brings out the worse in me (he has the capacity yes, but like once a month) but more importantly thinks it's unfair to keep the relationship up when he has no intention to come out.

I really like him, love him even and agreed (after a lot of cuddling and mutual crying) that it was best - we can't grow as a couple if only my friends know about us. I spent most of the weekend with him as a farewell but neither of us really wants this.  Are we being stupid?  Besides the King's Island incident, my friends have liked him a lot. Friend 1 has seen him since NYC and doesn't have any issues, friend 1 knows that the BF wouldn't have said what he said if friend 1 wasn't being a prick.

TL;DR: My boyfriend isn't out, thinks he brings out the worst in me, and wants to break things off. I agree that me being out and him not will cloud things in the future, more than they are.  We just don't know if it's the right decision.

Friend 1 has seen him since NYC and doesn&amp;#39;t have any issues, friend 1 knows that the BF wouldn&amp;#39;t have said what he said if friend 1 wasn&amp;#39;t being a prick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: My boyfriend isn&amp;#39;t out, thinks he brings out the worst in me, and wants to break things off. I agree that me being out and him not will cloud things in the future, more than they are.  We just don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s the right decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

I've been in a relationship with my boyfriend (who happens to be 26 years older than I am) for 2 years now; it would be 3 years in February. After a little over a year, he lost his job so he had to move over 800km away from me and I only get to see him once or twice a year for 1-2 weeks at a time because I am currently working on a B.Sc. in Forensic Science and Chemistry and don't get a lot of time off from my studies. He's also deeply closeted as bisexual.

All was fine, seemingly, until this week. It's obviously very hard for both of us and I personally had a moment of weakness a few months ago and asked him if he wanted to have an open relationship but he told me to ""not give up"" and I didn't. I instantly felt my resolve become even stronger in that moment. We both have PTSD but he has a much harder time dealing with it than I do, and he went to see his friend (who happens to be a military therapist) about 3 days ago. He came out to his friend for the first time in his entire life that day, and told him about us and how he was having a hard time dealing with the distance. His friend (who is even older than he is) basically told him ""I always knew that you had some deviancies. You should break up with him because it's not fair to him. He has his entire life ahead of him while you only have the next 20 years or so before you retire."" and I think that that messed with my boyfriend deeply. I've never had a problem with the difference in age, and obviously I don't think that it's ""unfair"" otherwise I wouldn't still be here.. But my boyfriend basically told me today that he is thinking about breaking up with me, partly due to the distance (and how it's affecting his PTSD), partly because his friend made him feel guilty, and partly because he wants ""to get laid but can't.""

I don't fucking know what to think at this point. I told him to do what he thinks is best for him, and he said that he will wait another 2-4 weeks and ""see how it goes."" Part of me is glad that he wants to at least wait things out a little before calling off a multiple-year relationship and yet another part of me wishes that he would just get it over with so that I can start healing. I absolutely love him and I feel like my heart is already broken even though nothing has happened yet.. I've become an anxiety wreck these past few days and all I want to do is listen to Depressive Suicidal Black Metal (I'm a metalhead).

It's also horrible timing because not only am I ***extremely*** busy with school for the next 3 weeks to the point that I don't even know if I have *time* to grieve, but my 20th birthday is in 21 days and it may just end up being my worst birthday ever....

It would get lost in /r/AskReddit, and I figure /r/ainbow would be too supportive, etc. I just want to know why this bothers people.

It seems like a lot of people think there are two types of gay men: gaybros and flamers. Gaybros are the manly kind and flamers are the feminine and bad kind who hit on straight guys and advertise their sexuality and hold back gay rights for everyone else and are the worst people in the universe. Supposedly. If all of us flamers disappeared from the face of the Earth, the world would be a better place.

Thing is, I'm not really open about my sexual orientation in the first place, and I can probably say without exaggerating that most people who know me think I'm the quietest person they've ever met. But I'm also really skinny, and my voice, although deep, sounds a tiny bit gay. I try to be really nice to everyone (e.g., men and women), I have just a slightly submissive personality, and I don't consider myself a ""bro"" kind of guy.

Because I'm not good at small talk and generally avoid participating in it, I guess most people never notice. But I've been opening up a bit, and I've also *needed* to speak up more in general lately. Incidentally, I've also started to get shit. 

Yesterday at my part-time job, I overheard people gossiping about my sexual orientation. First group of people who did it were clearly doing it derisively. Second group didn't seem particularly negative, but I don't see why the fact that I (seem to) like guys is an interesting topic of conversation for people. I had to cover for someone who didn't show up to work that day, so I had to speak to a lot of customers; one of them mocked my voice, and it sounded very much like a stereotypical gay voice.

I'm not out to my parents, but today I think I might have heard my mother make a joke in passing about me sleeping with guys. (She was speaking to me, but in Spanish, which isn't my first language.) And my stepfather has been even more of a dick than usual lately, so maybe it's because they're starting to believe that I'm gay.

Aside from all that shit I mentioned, I don't think I'm even that girly. Most of the stuff I like is pretty manly (e.g., video games, prog metal music by bands like Meshuggah, computer science, etc.). But because of the voice and the somewhat twinky body, that doesn't count.

I think I've made this post too much about me, though, and my question is just, in general: **why does it squick people out if a dude is a little feminine?** Even I'm guilty of this, to some extent. If I see a guy wearing makeup, for example, my initial mental reaction isn't ""That's kinda unattractive,"" but something more like ""That's disgusting."" And then I think about it and realize that there isn't necessarily a rational reason for that.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This question isn&amp;#39;t directed specifically at gaybros, but I figured I wouldn&amp;#39;t really get the response I want from anyone else.

&lt;p&gt;Aside from all that shit I mentioned, I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;m even that girly. Most of the stuff I like is pretty manly (e.g., video games, prog metal music by bands like Meshuggah, computer science, etc.). But because of the voice and the somewhat twinky body, that doesn&amp;#39;t count.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I&amp;#39;ve made this post too much about me, though, and my question is just, in general: &lt;strong&gt;why does it squick people out if a dude is a little feminine?&lt;/strong&gt; Even I&amp;#39;m guilty of this, to some extent. If I see a guy wearing makeup, for example, my initial mental reaction isn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s kinda unattractive,&amp;quot; but something more like &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s disgusting.&amp;quot; And then I think about it and realize that there isn&amp;#39;t necessarily a rational reason for that.&lt;/p&gt;

* If indeed a push is mandated, why do people think they have the right to push someone they don't know. I can see family or friends encouraging someone, but anyone that thinks they have the right to force another person they don't know to do anything is an asshole.

But, what's the deal with this..since when is it okay to push people to come out of the closet.  Perhaps I'm too sensitive, but I think this is crossing a boundary if the closeted person doesn't want to talk about the topic of sexual orientation.

This might not be the right place to post so if not please let me know where I should!

So myself and my ex female S/O had always been open in the bedroom, however she was mostly the more submissive of the two of us, which I was always happier with.

Anyway a while back she was teasing me with her hands and playing with my balls, she had got into the habit of stoking behind my undercarriage as it turns me on alot and was starting to get a little more adventurous. Her finger would wander down the path between my ass and undercarriage and I'd get a shiver and grow harder in her hand. She never pushed in though but would tease and graze over my hole.

We sometimes did oil massages and one such time she was teasing me and I pushed myself down onto her finger as it wandered south, she looked at me and I asked her to push in, it was the first time I have ever done anything with my ass but she complied and I loved it. She was gentle and slow but the deeper she went the better. After this she had done it a few other times and even used her tongue on me. I found this sort of stimulation amazing and it really got me off.

Since the first time I have had fantasies of her just fucking me, I want to be the submissive one and to have my legs in the air or her hands around my ankles and to just have her go at me with a strapon. Though I feel this is something far in the future after she said she was not too interested and if I wanted to explore it I could go and find a guy that was willing to instead. Anyway we broke up a while ago and I was left with this chance/desire to fulfil some inquisitive thoughts in my head. I've recently been exploring my own body and find myself fingering more and more.

So my question/problem is I want to be fucked by a guy, but I want a man who knows what he'd doing to just have me on my back and y'know play with my cock and tease my ass. I just want that dominance and to be milked. I'm not into kissing or oral but I'll happily use my hands as well, in fact I'm quite interested in that.

It's really tempting to me...but I'm nervous. Because it's Craigslist.
