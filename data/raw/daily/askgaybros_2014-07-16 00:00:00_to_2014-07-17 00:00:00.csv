Let's say his name is Damien. In my eyes, Damien is dorky, nerdy, geeky, but he's also cute, funny, handsome, loving and caring, although, he doesn't seem to realize some of these qualities himself. Damien has always made me feel loved and special. 

The thing is, we have a 9 year age difference. He's in his early 30's and I'm in my mid 20's. He is stable and successful in his career and still has the opportunity to grow. Meanwhile, here I am, out of school, slightly off the path I wanted to go and not having a start on my career. I have goals and dreams, which I want to achieve, however; I'm currently a little lost, but is slowly finding my way again. 

There were once or twice where we talked about our future together, but every time that happens, I start feeling sad and pathetic, because I'm still lost, while he seems to have everything more together. Currently, my future is so unclear that I feel horrible knowing that I can't realistically plan a future with him yet, despite how much I want to. I feel like I can't meet his expectations. I believe in the concept of ""Work Hard, Play Hard."" I know that he's worked hard, but he deserves to be happy. I, on the other hand, haven't work as hard as I should, so why should I deserve this happiness (him)? 

The current reoccurring issue is I don't feel like I'm worth it. I don't want him to settle for me, especially since I'm such a mess. I think he's happy with me, but I believe he can be happier with someone else who has better circumstances than me. We are currently in an open relationship, although he has wanted to close it for a while, but I don't want him to limit himself just because he's in a relationship with me. Perhaps in this open relationship, he can find a better person. I honestly just want him to be happy, whether he's with me or not, but if someone else can make him happy, then so be it. He treats me so well that I wish I can do the same, if not more to him.

Is it wrong to think the way I do? That I'm not worth it? Sometimes I question why he's with me because I'm not attractive, I don't have a nice body, I feel so average. 

Am I wasting his time?

I've talked to Damien about this before and he says it's because I have low self-esteem that I feel this way. It may have developed and exacerbated from my previous relationship, but who knows?

I am a pretty conservative guy sexually (only bottom 3-4x a year unless dating a guy; but have oral, frot more), but am no angel. Almost all of the anal sex I've had has been protected (bare with a long term ex). The dermatologist said over 30% of her patients have genital warts and said even with condoms ""there's a lot of skin contact and stuff flopping around back there"".

I have a follow-up appointment on Thursday to determine how to proceed. Despite the fact that most guys are supposedly exposed to HPV, I've never heard a guy say he has it and have certainly never seen warts. I feel dirty now and am not sure what this means for my ass and sex life going forward. Obviously nothing is going in my ass for a long time (which is fine). Can I still have oral sex with guys without the fear I'm infecting them by touching my skin or dick? I've been trying to go on proper dates with guys- what would you do now? What would you tell your work and your family when you have the surgery? It's supposed to be week or so of recovery time and pooping sounds like a fucking nightmare. Ugh.

Any experiences, advice, or support is greatly appreciated. :)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;#39;ve had what I thought were hemorrhoids just inside my ass for a few months and was hoping they&amp;#39;d go away. The didn&amp;#39;t so yesterday I saw a dermatologist and she confirmed my big fear- they are anal warts or HPV. She said I&amp;#39;ll have to get them cut out! by a colorectal surgeon. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a pretty conservative guy sexually (only bottom 3-4x a year unless dating a guy; but have oral, frot more), but am no angel.

So, I've been talking to this guy on OKCupid recently. We hit off great. Turns out one of his best friends is one of my work friends, so that helped ease the tension, and started chatting it up for the last few days. We want to meet up for a date in NYC on Saturday. To grab a bite to eat. Is it better to ask him out to lunch or dinner?

I thought Lunch might be better because then we could spend more of the day together, but at the same time Dinner can be more intimate, and we both seem pretty interested in one another. What are your thoughts bros. Any advice would be a huge help!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys,&lt;/p&gt;
