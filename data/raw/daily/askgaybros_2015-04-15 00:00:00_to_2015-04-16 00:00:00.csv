Before I came out of the closet, one night back when we were 18, we were hanging out and he was really high on suboxone back when he was into pills, and he told me he was bi. After that I immediately grew feelings for him that never went away. 2 days later he told me it was just the drugs talking and that he is completely straight (which in my mind, that kind of thing doesn't just come out of nowhere but I'm not going to sit here and assume how other people work).

Anyways so here I am now, my feelings for him grew worse and I was able to be a man and mature about it and finally tell him how I feel about him for the sake of not letting how I feel wreck our friendship. It went well and he told me it doesn't make him think any different of me. Well telling him also ended up making it worse for me and now I'm in an emotional bind. I hang out with him every day and it's very clear our friendship is important to him as it is to myself. But I can't even maintain a love life because of it, I always end up blowing guys off because I'd rather be with him. And then I just end up taunting myself by putting myself around him all the time. 

Part of me really wants to distance myself but I care so much about him and we are already about to be college roommates and I just feel like I can't. I want to find another guy to help me forget about it as well but my negative attitude towards it and small town gay life haven't helped me out. So what now, do I just deal with it?

I guess pretty much everyone of us have been there, at that time when you just need to stop looking outside and give the *inside* some attention. When you finally feel kinda tired to go on dates and would rather just focus on yourself and your own well-being. Well, I've hit that spot too.

When you did find yourself in that situation, what did you do? How did you face your everyday routine with this change in perspective?

I'll go ahead and give some examples myself from my own situation:

First step: I just deleted everything Tinder or Grindr-ish. I just can't care with those anymore, and that usually gets in your way *a lot* more than you might think. Second step: deleted some pics left in my mobile that might remind me of times I don't want to be remembered (ex-bf).

As of right now, I'm pretty much just playing games I like and going to the gym regularly. But I'm starting to think about dedicating myself even more to training at the gym (training everyday as opossing to just every other day) as well as learning to eat healthier. Hanging out with friends [isn't exactly one of my best bets](http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/31h0it/i_cant_hang_out_with_friends_anymore/), but I usually *do* find some chilling moments depending on where we go or what we do (games and boardgames, mostly). Besides that, I usually use what's left of my time to brush off some C# programming so I can get a little better at my job.

What about you? I'd like to hear more ideas on how to enjoy yourself and your own company. Feel free to share yours!

But this is really my only outlet. I am sorry if I bother anyone with this. I know I've made some enemies here, but I don't have any friends and I just want someone to listen.

I've had my cat Annie (Technically his name is Anakin :/) for about 12 years. He was always a scaredy cat and didn't like anyone but me.

He was the kinda cat who would get excited to see me and cuddle with me, but then after 5 minutes he'd get bored and do his own thing. He wasn't particularly active or affectionate. But he had his moments.

I grew up with a family who wasn't really there for me. My dad left when I was 3, mom was too busy working since she was a single parent, and my sisters only stayed during the summers.

Annie was my only family. Someone I could come home to who I knew was there for me and had all the time in the world for me.

The past few months he has been showing his age. I wasn't too nervous at first. He was still jumping and eating, and he always was pretty lazy.

This past week he just left. My cat is no longer here. Its just his body walking around living. His mind is a blank and he does not respond to anything. And it kills me that I didn't get to cherish his last moments of him knowing who I was.

Its hard watching him trip and stumble everywhere. Refusing to eat or drink. And puking everywhere. He doesn't deserve this.

And its still not real to me. I feel like I am going to wake up and it was all a dream. He'll meow and meow demanding I feed him and pet him. But I know the cat I knew and loved is already gone.

I have an appointment in the morning. I'm glad its my day off because I don't know how properly I can function.

So to anyone who read everything I thank you. I'm glad that I had this moment to remember the life I had with him. I know not everyone is a cat person, and maybe I'm insane for being so upset. 
But I don't care. He was practically my child and I don't know what it's going to be like being so alone at home.

Here are some of my favorite pictures of him. Most are from a couple years ago.

http://imgur.com/RPeECKn,EjWIUYk,vm9PzJq,KaQuXTN,zc8iMe7,C04X9JM,HtoZsyh#0

EDIT: He had kidney failure, and the vet said at best he had a 10% chance to survive. He would need constant fluid IV injections but it was such a low probability. I did not want him to have to live like that and thought it best to put him to sleep now and ease his pain. 

I really want to thank you all. It was nice to know people were thinking about him, and to hear (read) your kind words. I still don't believe it... but I'm getting there. Thank you all.

So we sat in his house and I simply started talking, using the excuse that we only had like 5 minutes. I told him that I understand that people feel love at different times, that just because I said what I said he wasn't forced to say it back, that I wanted to know if I had scared him, that I wanted to know why was he so strange ever since, what he actually wanted in a relationship, what he thought was a real relationship... all this and I never noticed that his face was getting redder.

He then started bawling.

Trying not to panic, I tried my best to both make him comfortable and at the same time understand why was he so upset. He just kept screaming that he was sorry.

When he calmed down a bit, he said that the only thing he wants is for us to be happy. Together. He said that he was scared of him not being on the same page and that he thought he was actually a monster for not appreciating me more. And that if I needed to hear it, he would say it. I told him that I could understand if he wasn't in that place yet, and that I'd love to hear it, of course I would, but not until he actually felt it. He then calmed down more and started talking about the future. I asked him what he wanted for the future, and his answer surprised me. He actually wants the same things that I want. Marriage, kids, house, pets (he likes cats and I like dogs, but that can be fixed), and so on. We then agreed to postpone our moving in together until a better time.

He then simply said: I want to feel what you feel. I don't know why I acted the way that I acted, but I want to be there with you. Just give me a little time, I'm slow.

So we made up, had a very nice talk after that, had something to eat, and after fucking his brains out we were exactly in the same position. He was getting ready to sleep, but rather than opening my mouth, I simply smiled at him and left.

While walking to the bus stop, he sent me a text: I don't know who am I kidding. I feel the same way. I want to say it. Come back.

But I replied: Not until you're ready. And if you're ready now, you'll be ready next time I see you. Good night.

And then he replied with a blue, heart-shaped emoticon. **I fucking hate emoticons! And he knows it!** But it's the thought that counts, right? So I smiled and waited for the last bus.

TL,DR: I confronted him, he cried and he apologized, he wants what I want but is not there yet, we made up, postponed the moving in, tried to say it by text but I told him to be ready first.

About a year ago give or take, I started seeing an older man, he was caring, funny, amazing in bed (best sex I've ever had), he fell in love with me, and I in return. However; here's the catch, he is so deep in the closet that there was no way for me to open the door and he also had a beard of a girlfriend. I came to y'all for some advice about how to go through this and if I should keep my mouth shut to her or tell her. So in the end I kept my mouth shut. We broke up due to reasons in the update about us, but to condense it; he loved me, but he would never come out of the closet even if she wasn't in the picture. So we left things like that. 

Fast forward about 5 months since then.

We reconnected after I had an STD scare because he was the only guy I was unprotected with and my most recent partner. So I confronted him and things got heated and I really hate to admit, but we ended up having sex. It was passionate, fun, intense, and he is the only guy to ever make me feel the way I feel with him. However; this time it was different because someone had seen us, and told his girlfriend about us and how it wasn't the first time they had seen us together. So basically everyone is unhappy, we don't know how to move on and there is a part of me that wants her to leave him, but I know that he would die if that happened because he needs to keep up this story that he is straight if not bisexual at least. I'm starting to think he has some internalized homophobia or something. 

So now, I guess I don't even know what to ask or say. Everyone is unhappy, we can't seem to get our heads out of our own ass. So I guess I just need someone to talk too (without the whole I'm disappointed in you for sleeping with a man who has a girlfriend and such).

Anyway, I was wondering if this is somewhat normal for someone that went through what I did when I was younger.. and if so, is there any way to get over my erotic thoughts, because, let's face it, it's quite fucked up.

I said ""Dad, I've something important to tell you..."" and then I just said it. At first he was just staring blankly into the air and then the longest, most awkward silence I've experienced ensued. He sighed a few times, breathing deeply. Obviously it hit him hard and he was pretty shocked. Finally he said that he would like to talk about it at a later time as he had a hard time dealing with it at the moment.

It took me about 17 years to accept who I am and even longer to come out to the people that I love, so it was ok if he needed time.

This is a problem, because I don't want to scare away potential husbands away before they've had a chance to fall in love with me. So, for the several months, I've been trying to rectify the situation.

I've ""gayed"" up my style a little bit, made more passing eye contact with strangers and even thrown out a few more head nods to people on the street. I've also worked on my body language and broken myself of the tendency to fold my arms.

But today, I formally met two homos that I had seen around town a few times and one of them told me (verbatim) ""Oh, I just assumed that you were some angry straight guy that'd kick my ass if I spoke to you.""

So, I'm realizing that my work isn't done. Any tips?

Heyoo,

My boyfriend and I are having a lag in our relationship because he has a huge anal fetish, and I find the whole thing uncomfortable/painful. We've tried different kinds of lube, using my toy to kinda...prepare myself, and we just ordered a butt-plug to hopefully help as well. 

So far nothing really works, and he's getting frustrated that he can't have anal sex, and I'm getting fed up with his fits and pouty attitude. I understand why he's doing it, and I've tried telling him that I want to be able to fulfill his want, I wish I could give it to him all the time, but it really hurts me, and sometimes I'm just pooping a lot and don't want him sticking his dick in that hole! 

I try my best to fulfill all of his other fantasies and kinks, but this one is just really difficult for me. He's told me before that he can't be in a relationship where he doesn't get anal sex. 

I'd be super appreciative if I could get some feedback/advice from you guys. 

Thank you so much!

""Wow, this city is awesome!"" I thought.

And then I went back to Toronto and that never happens here. Damn you Toronto. My goal now is to marry a Jew-Itali-Irish man from Brooklyn who will take me out to eat authentic NYC food (bagels).

He seemed pretty cool, and he was the first to suggest we go out on a date. I agreed, and we were going to go out Thursday for dinner around 7, followed by going out to bars at night.

Well 7 comes around, and at 8 he tells me he was hung up at work because a co-worker was freaking out about her son coming out to her. I was a bit upset he didn't tell me this before 7, but I just wrote it off because I was interested in him. We changed plans to just go out to the clubs around 11. Well 11 comes around, and he tells me he just got back to his apartment, and he forgot that he promised he'd spend the night with a friend. At this point, I'm livid, but I hid it, because I don't believe in just writing people off. Still, I felt like his stories - the coworker freaking out and him ""forgetting"" he had plans - were just really... off. It seemed like a bizarre coincidence. We make a plan to meet up the next morning. 

We meet the next morning (Friday) and have breakfast/lunch. We share some stuff about ourselves. He tells me he's not really close to anyone in his family except his brother. Later - after the date - he tells me he had just gotten out of a three-year relationship, and I was the first guy he'd dated since then. We make plans to go out Saturday around 9 to the club we planned to go to Thursday. 

Saturday night I'm texting him, and he says he's going to be late because he has to work on a psychology paper. He finishes around 10:30 and says he just has to shower and get dressed and he'll head over. I tell him to text me when he heads out. Hours pass. It's midnight. No response. I give up on that and go to sleep. The next morning he apologizes and says he freaked out because he was nervous about dating again after breaking up. By now I'm getting definite, ""this guy is a total flake,"" vibes from him, but I have sympathy, so we talk through it all, and it turns out he just wants the relationship to go more slowly, so it's all worked out. We make plans to hang out at my place Monday night around 7 and just watch TV.

Obviously I don't have to tell you what *didn't* happen Monday night. Around 6 he texts me saying he has to go to this storage locker his ex owns, filled with his furniture. He says he probably won't be able to leave until about 8:30-9. Well I text him at 9:30 and he says that his ex had destroyed all the furniture in the locker and he was out $5000. He was so pissed he punched his ex, so the cops were called. Eventually he told me his ex decided not to press charges, but at this point, red flags were flying all over the place in my head.

You see, there were several inconsistencies in the stories he'd told me over the past few days. First, he said he wasn't close to any of his female siblings. But Sunday he said one of them asked for my picture. Then he said he broke up with his ex four months ago. On facebook, however, there's a picture of them looking pretty much in-love as late as the end of March. On Valentine's Day, there's a picture of his ex kissing him (albeit on the cheek) saying he loves him, to which the guy responded ""love you too :)."" He said they remained in touch after breaking up, but this seems uber-suspicious to me. All this, plus those weird stories from the beginning make me think all of this is some elaborate scam against me.

I know it could - in large part - be due to my insecurities (I mean, no matter how you slice it, I feel more comfortable believing this guy is scamming me than into me), and I know he hasn't asked for anything to suggest he's playing me, but I can't shake this feeling that he's playing me. So I broke it off. 

So what do you think, GayBros? Was breaking things off the smartest course of action? Do you think he was trying to play a scam?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;ve recently started online dating, and I met a guy online I really liked.
