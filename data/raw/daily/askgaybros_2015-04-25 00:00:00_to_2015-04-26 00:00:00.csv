Now, I get suspicious over dumb things that I shouldn't.  For example, I saw Kik on his phone and kind of freaked out.  Or he read a message on his phone, then quickly put it away and ignored me when I asked about it.  Turns out it was a tweet from someone and he didn't hear my follow-up question.

Does anyone else have issues with this?  I know it's all in my head, but it makes me feel so guilty when I don't trust him sometimes even though he really hasn't done anything to deserve it.

We're always hanging out, playing games, and 420blazing it. People have told us that we're inseparable. 

He identifies as straight. He pursues relationships with girls. He talks about how much he loves tata's and vajayjays. But some of the things he says and does concerns me. I just want to respect the boundaries between us and maintain this friendship no matter what. 

A couple of months ago, the language between us started getting very intense. We went book shopping together and later told our friends about the trip. As he tells the story, he mentions me as his significant other. Now in the present, he calls me all sorts of cute names like boo and bae when we hang out. 

We're both addicted to Snapchat. We both love sending out selfies to one another. But recently, some of his messages have been very concerning. He's been sending me shirtless pictures with flirty captions or just pictures of him looking especially sexy. 

There was one day when we were talking about something really intense. He was going through some problems at home. He said thank you for listening and being here. He followed it with, ""If I were gay, we'd be the best couple ever.""

I don't understand the message that he's trying to put out. Or maybe he's just being cute and playful. I feel emotionally barren because I care so much about him. I'm falling for him hard and want to tell him how I feel. I feel like he'll never reciprocate the feelings that I have. I don't even have the motivation to find someone else because everyone else just isn't as good compared to him. Is he just gaslighting me? Should I tell him how I feel?

I am joining the US Navy, I leave in 9 days and yesterday and today are the last two days I'll get to see my best friend. We've been friends for 8 years, since we pledged our fraternity in college together. It has been a mixed bag of emotions with me because I was figuring out my sexuality my entire time in college. He has been by my side and always had my back, he is one of my greatest supporters, roommates for a few years and we know everything about each other.

So we planned this weekend to see each other, go out Friday night, eat at a Fancy restaurant and go out drinking in NYC (where he lives) Prior to coming he tells me to wear my sleazy underwear. I laugh knowing he's making a joke because we have discussed my escapades on grindr a lot and he know's bout my Andrew Christin obsession. So i come in on the train and we meet up, I give him a fraternity paddle I had been promising him since before we graduated. We go to a few bars, get a little tipsy and as we're talking he feels my ass...three times, like reach around grab and firmly squeeze. I brush it off as tipsy and getting handsy. He's a straight guy, never been handsy with me before. 

Let me pause here a minute. So for the last few months he has been exploring his sexuality. Gone on a few dates, a few sex encounters, confirms with me that he is Prodomanitly straight but just loves to make out with people and give a blow job, he feels good giving others pleasure. I have teased him saying that he must have a crush on me which he lughs at and brushes off as just some ballbusting, which it is. I tell him he's not my type (very true) and he says the same. 

I move on still having a good night like nothing happened because tht's how he's treating it.  Dinner comes and he's pushing more and more drinks at me, wanting to get wasted. We had spoken in the days leading up to this weekend about getting drunk vs getting shit faced and my reluctancy about it because I don't need to end up getting in trouble a week before I leave for the Navy.  As we go to the next bar i switch to water. I even tried to trick him as he kept buying drinks (i drink gin n tonics) I went to the bartender and flat out said ""make these waters look like G&amp;T"" but my friend picked up on it quick. I just stopped drinking fully, only ending up having 3 beers 2 G&amp;T and a handful of shots for the whole night. 

Now, again, we're at the bar with some of his coworkers and he's touchy feely with a bunch of them and then with me an back n forth more in a pestering way. Pokes to the sides, trying to grab our cheeks (face) and ballbusting all around. We all return jab for jab and it moves on. Toward the end of the night, i'm resting at the bar between a few coworkers and he comes over and sits in a chair right next to me and positions himself nonchalantly with my leg between his. He rests his hand on my knee as he lend forward for his drink and then leaves his hand there.  I move away. We leave the bar around 430am and we catch a cab to his place, the entire cab ride the poking and pinching continue, i restrain his hands but he keeps doing it. I think in my head I'm thinking at this point he's trying something as i see a few pokes miss and his hand lands on my thigh, some almost reach my crotch. He's really drunk and i'm half way sober. We get to his place and go upstairs. I'm sleeping in his brothers bed in the same room as my friend, we lay down. He says make yourself comfortable. I take my collared shirt off and leave my muscle tank and pants on as i forgot pj's and i was wearing tight underwear. He tells me to get more comfortable, i ignore the comment. We lay down and he says playfully ""come cuddle"" i laugh out loud and he says it two more times in a 10 minute period of falling asleep.

We are sleeping at this point, and i toss and turn in my sleep so i wake up now and then. I hope i was dreaming this next part but i wake up an look down and my friend is standing at the edge of my bed with his hand slowly reaching for my crotch. I move my hand in  a jerking motion and turn on my side going back to sleep. I watch him get back in bed like i scared him off. I hope i was dreaming that because it puts the other pieces of the night in more of a bad context to me.

This is the closest person in my life, the guy with me through thick and thin,  a true brother to me, and for this to go down i feel distraught. We still hve today to hang out, luckily we're having a party at a beer hall with a lot of my friends but i just feel...betrayed? I don't know if that's the word, i just want to have my last day with my best friend not end horrendously. Any advice? Should i just let it go till he makes another move? Confront him when he wakes up or at some point in the day?

Sorry, again on my phone, grammar is going to stink. Alsonsorry if this is a lot of writing

I'm a 19 year virgin and today I bought my first dildo. It's pretty big, but I thought that I could take it. So, I lubed it up and damn, it didn't even fit into my butt.

My whole body just kind of began tingling and I had this... Pressure about behind the base of my cock. Naturally I stopped and was kind of scared. So I focused on my breathing again and... nothing.

The options I’m considering are all in gay-friendly parts of the country, but the fact that I’m not out to my parents complicates things. I need to reach a decision by 4/30, so I’d appreciate quick feedback.

**School A**

- More prestigious: more opportunities for the research I want to do, greater access to influential faculty who can write me strong letters to residency programs when it comes time for me to apply

- 4-year total cost: $100K if I commute from home, $180K if I stay on campus. Parents have agreed to cover these costs, so I just need to pay them back at my own leisure once I start earning a decent salary

- Close to home

**School B**

- Offered me a scholarship covering full cost-of-attendance: tuition, housing, supplies 

- Less prestigious, but not garbage tier

- In a city → haven’t lived in a city before, think I might like it, but might end up hating it and perform badly in my classes

- Far away from home

If I were straight, I wouldn’t mind eating the $100K cost to go to School A. The difference in the opportunities and name recognition is worth it to me. $180K, not so much. 


The major factor drawing me towards School B is that I’m tired of hiding things from friends and family. If I go to School A, I’ll probably stay in the closet for another 4 years. My parents are sweet, loving people, but they are also devout Christians who come from cultures that are very homophobic. I don’t even know how they’ll react to my coming out because I’ve been too scared to ask them about their opinions on gay people.


How important is it to be “out” in my early 20s? I wouldn’t mind staying in the closet for 4 more years if it wouldn’t stunt my emotional and psychosocial development. I’m just afraid that by the time I am in a place where I can safely come out, I wouldn’t know how to develop a strong, emotional connection with a partner because of the years of burying my sexuality. I’ve had a 2-year relationship implode on me because I couldn’t bring myself to genuinely care about the guy when I felt that I had to keep everything hidden.


On the flipside, I would hate to have chosen School B, come out, then have my parents support me; I would have wasted a chance to go to a fantastic school close to a support network.


What to do, bros?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been accepted to a few med schools and need to reach a decision about where I want to spend the next 4-5 years of my life. The options I’m considering are all in gay-friendly parts of the country, but the fact that I’m not out to my parents complicates things. I need to reach a decision by 4/30, so I’d appreciate quick feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;School A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;More prestigious: more opportunities for the research I want to do, greater access to influential faculty who can write me strong letters to residency programs when it comes time for me to apply&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;4-year total cost: $100K if I commute from home, $180K if I stay on campus. Parents have agreed to cover these costs, so I just need to pay them back at my own leisure once I start earning a decent salary&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Close to home&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;School B&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Offered me a scholarship covering full cost-of-attendance: tuition, housing, supplies &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Less prestigious, but not garbage tier&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a city → haven’t lived in a city before, think I might like it, but might end up hating it and perform badly in my classes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Far away from home&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

A bit of background: My ex (21) and I (23) met on Grindr. We fell for each other almost immediately, and soon, we were spending almost everyday with each other… We exchanged ""I love you's"" after 2 months and were both head over heels for each other. Our sex life was fantastic, and we were emotionally connected (similar personal/family issues). After 2 months, he told me that he would be going into the military the following August (this year). I decided to break up with him two weeks later, because I felt like he didn't think about me in applying, so I felt it was best to end it (which is completely idiotic considering he said that he applied so our lives could be easier/better together). I fucked up… and it's a decision I regret.

Present day: After not messaging for months, I still think about him everyday. I miss everything about him. His smile, compassion, drive, empathy and much much more. I've seen (on Facebook) that he's been in a relationship and really into this guy, which I'm happy for. He sent me a text last week saying that he's leaving for boot camp in 3 weeks… He leaves in mid-May instead of August and wanted to meet up. So I agreed to meet up, because I want to see him and talk to him. 

Meet up: We meet up at a coffee shop, and I begin to feel uneasy. I miss him so much and seeing him brought back moments with him. As we were leaving, he suggested we go to the beach and talk because he picked up that something might be wrong. We talk about him leaving so soon, and says he's very excited (rightfully so), and eager to start his new life. For most of the evening, I remained distant and silent and he picked up on it almost immediately. He turned to me and asked what was wrong. I was buckling so bad, but began to murmur the words ""I still love you and made a mistake breaking up with you"". I began to cry and he consoled me, which helped me calm down. After I calmed down, he said that he didn't have any mutual feelings for me, and that being friends is the most that would ever happen between us… I expected this, but hearing it was so painful. I began to cry again, but he didn't console me this time. He said that he was sorry but that I made a decision to break up with him, and he had to accept it just as he had to when I broke up with him… Soon after that, he dropped me off at my house, and told me that it's probably best that I not contact him for a while, because he didn't want to ruin the relationship he's currently in. So I agreed, hugged him goodbye, wished him well in the Army, and then was crying like a baby on my bed. I know it was hard for me, but I cannot imagine what I put my ex through, and I feel even worse for that…

So here I am, crying as I'm writing this post, because of a stupid mistake I made when I was upset. Now I don't know what to do. How do I stop thinking about him? How can I truly get over him? He made me feel so happy and now, I feel so shit right now, that I don't even feel like living…

I've never posted here, but I'm in need of some advice.

I'm a sophomore undergraduate who hasn't been in a relationship before. Recently, I started talking to this guy in my class. We've sort of been exchanging nonverbal cues for a while, but neither of us acted upon them until I initiated. I've had a crush on this guy for a while now (I also had a class with him last semester), but I couldn't muster the courage to initiate until recently. I regret not doing so earlier this semester or even last semester because now that we're talking, there are only two weeks left in this semester. Soon we'll be busy with finals.

I really want to get to know this guy, but I don't want to come on too strong because I think I'd scare him off. I suspect maybe he's uncomfortable with his sexuality. He moved to sit right by me in class now, but he seems a lot tenser being right by me. Last semester I assumed he was straight because he seems like a typical straight guy. He might've thought the same of me.

Next week I'm planning on asking him if he wants to catch a movie. Just something casual. If he's a bit shy about his sexuality, a movie seems best because we won't be talking or facing each other during the movie. We'll do that before and after of course.

I have it really bad for this guy, and I don't want to let him get away. He lives near our campus, and I'm planning on staying here after the semester ends, but everything is still up in the air for me. Summer could be an opportunity to get to know him if we're both still around.

So like a month ago I posted this http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/2zb6gv/my_best_friend_found_out_how_i_feel_about_him/

(TL;DR I had a crush/fell in love with my straight bestfriend and he found out and wouldn't talk to me)

So after I posted that a few days passed and eventually we started talking again, it was awkward at first but then everything went back to how it was before. We never talked about the subject but didn't need to, I guess I made it clear that it was something that would go away and that I only saw him as a friend and I wasn't expecting that we'd be something more than friends one day. It's been a month since that, and I had a lot of problems at home, I came out to my parents during a family fight (yeah, I'm the worst at picking the most convenient moments) my dad didn't accept it and screamt a lot of insults at me, he even took my car away and told me I wasn't even his son anymore, anyway it all lasted like two days because then my mom and I had to leave the house, turned out my dad was an addict, so older brother put him in a clinic, and my family is just a mess, through all this what kept me sane were my friends, specially him, so we grew even closer.

Then the most stupid thing happened, last Tuesday we were waiting for a class to start and were talking with other friends, Gus told one guy that he couldn't go to a pretty important presentation that the guy was giving and jokingly (but actually meaning it?) he said something like its okay he didn't expect support from Gus since he and Gus weren't friends anymore, when Gus asked him why he said that, he told him that Gus had changed him for me, to which Gus inmeditaly said, no, I like you more than ""dumbfriend12"" now I know it was a joke, but I take those things very serious and he knows that, I laughed there and pretended I didn't mind, and I would have if it wasn't because later that day, after a pretty big test we went to saw a soccer game and have a drink, the problem was that I drank a lot of beer and I confronted him about it, I have never been more drunk and it was like 10 pm, I threw a lot of insults (we insult each other all the time) and every five seconds Id tell him to stop talking to me and go talk to the other guy, and even when I got home (stayed with another friend) I sent him audios insulting him more (I'm quitting alcohol for a while)

So next day I wake up at 6 am, I'm still drunk, I know I fucked up somehow but don't remember clearly how so I go to WhatsApp and find the audios I sent and it all just came back to me, I immediately sent an apology, he never answered so I guess I had to wait to apologize personally, I see him at school and he ignores me. I sent a longer apology (the first was just like: sorry about yesterday I got really drunk lol)
He didn't answer either, and has been ignoring me like if we were in preschool and Im invisible or something.

So, what do you bros think, did I really fuck up that bad. Is he acting childishly?

Personally i wouldn't have gotten mad, I mean alcohol make people do pretty stupid things and you shouldn't take it very personal.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi guys!&lt;/p&gt;

What the hell do I do


Edit:

Oh and let me just add this is all happening right now very fast I'm literally freaking out. Apparently no one believes me and thinks I'm in a state of depression, from what I was told my sister is totally cool about it and said to my ex that she'll love me no matter what, but she thinks I'm just depressed right now (recently leaving my relationship, trying to find happiness)

Also I'd like to add in that my girlfriend isn't mad she's afraid and asking other people what they think because she's worried or something


[UPDATE]

Well, my sister has tried contacting me all day long and tried getting me to take a drive with her. I denied the first time she asked, but the second time I was in public and she said ""Come take a drive with me"" and I was like ""great.""

She never brought it up, she kept asking questions on if I'm happy with my life and she was afraid I would hurt myself because I've been depressed on and off for a while now due to a past relationship (I'm completely over it at this point, but she's still afraid)

Anyway when she was about to drop me off at my parents she said hey I'm clearing out my basement if you want to move in soon you can and I agreed and we're making plans now to get me some furniture and I'm gonna pay for some clothes and stuff..

Once I got inside and she went home, I felt bad and immediately texted her through facebook and officially came out to her. It definitely wasn't that bad at all, and actually makes me more hopeful to tell other people in the future.

Here's the convo btw: http://prntscr.com/6xssuc (the last part's kind of cut off, but she said she just wants to make sure I'm happy)

Most of these are weird questions. Answer whatever ones you feel like, and for simplicity's sake, number your answers according to the question number.

1.	STDs: I use a condom every time I hook up with a girl, and I wouldn’t do it any different hooking up with a guy. Do condoms usually work with gay sex? Do they break? Do you need special ones? Anything else I should know on this topic?

	Part 2: And what about oral? My instincts tell me that oral should only be done with a condom or something, but that’s also a mega buzz kill. How likely are STDs to spread that way?

2.	Rape: What are the realities/risks of rape? How might I approach dating/hooking up differently? (never had to think of this with girls)

3.	Swallowing: How gross on a scale of 1-10 is it?

4.	Still grossed out by anal sex: what would you say to someone who finds it gross? All anal stuff in general seems gross to me. I can’t sit through gay porn that involves anal. But at the same time deep down I am interested, and curious about being on either end. Do all gay hookups assume it will happen?

5.	What’s prostate stimulation like? I’ve tried it twice on my own in the shower (having a couple beers first), and I’m pretty sure I touched my prostate both times, but it didn’t give me any enjoyment whatsoever.

6.	Does having sex usually require a shower after and before? Is there often a need to clean up the area? Does poop stuff get around?

7.	Physical health: Is anal bad for your asshole? Do you have to get into it gradually? How would you do that? Do you inevitably have a fucking nasty period of bloody shit and pain? After you do anal enough, do things still work the same down there? I feel like that ripping and stuff is bad. And is a guy coming in your ass unhealthy or uncomfortable?

8.	What's it like telling a girl you're seeing that you're bi?

Okay that’s just about every question I have. Thanks people

I feel like I need to know for closure but I'm not sure if this would be a good idea, he's told me before not to keep things in that are bothering me so I'm inclined to think he would be receptive but I'm just unsure about the whole situation.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So me and my ex broke up about a year ago; we still hang out a lot, at least once a week, and are really good friends we share a lot with each other and are really open in general with each other.

Has anyone taken Lexapro and Wellbutrik together?
I've been taking Lex (5mg), but today my doctor suggested adding in Wellbutrin (150mg). I've been fine on just Lex, but sometimes get unexplainable anxiety spells.

Pretty nervous about adding more medication. While I've heard it can work well (the combo), I am so scared of anything medicine related. Hate anything changing my mental state.......but on the other hand I don't like anxiety either (what I've been dealing with on and off).

Would love any personal experiences or advice.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi guys.......I know this is a somewhat irregular topic, but just wanting some advice/feedback from other gay guys who may be going through the same.&lt;/p&gt;
