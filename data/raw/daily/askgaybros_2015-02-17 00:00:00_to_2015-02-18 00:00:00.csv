Good kid, smart and with a good spirit. But he's missing his father who I think is doing time in prison at the moment, just his mom and grandparents. One day he suddenly left my school over a misunderstanding between him and his mom (he borrowed a video game from a friend but she claimed he stole it), they moved to another city to be close to the grandparents. 

Anyway, we kept in contact via facebook. I reached out to him today just to see how he's doing (his mother gave me permission to keep in contact with him). Asking about his new school, how his family is, that kind of thing. Then he messaged me this:

    I got a BIG question
    Its kinda serious
    A couple days ago i was on youtube
    And i stumbled across a channel by the name of "" Lush""
    But the guys on the channel are gay
    But i didn't know that
    But i looked at some of there videos
    And something just struck me
    Like..
    A feeling
    Of the gayness and happiness
    And like
    They inspired me to be gay and stuff
    You will know why if you watch the videos
    But
    Im not sure
    I don't know
    Like..
    If it's a good thing or bad thing
    Because im at the age were I'm curious about these type of things

Well, I care for this kid and I know that there aren't many older male voices in his life that he could trust. So after cautioning him about discussing this topic to people over the internet, and that he should try talking to his mom about this, I did my best to give him advice. These feelings don't stem from a crush he has in real life, he just got positive feelings from this 'Lush' youtube channel (that seems to embrace every gay stereotype you can think of). 

We were in conversation about this for about an hour. He feels like an outsider at his school, is probably a little starved for feelings of love, and I'm doing my best to give advice to a boy going through a very confusing time in his life.

Furthermore, I feel like anyone who is willing to top someone should also be open to bottoming. I mean, they should be open to at least trying it once.


The situation gets even more complex when you take into mind that he doesn't mind anal play or rimming, but he just doesn't want a penis in there, which doesn't make sense to me.


It makes me feel like he thinks bottoming makes someone less of a man or something, and I am not willing to put up with that mentality since I am bottoming for him.

I'm in my mid-twenties, have a boyfriend (for 3+ years) whom I'm living together with, and I am out to nearly all my friends and family. So far, so good - but I live in a small city in Germany (about 30.000 people) and never have been in much contact with the gay community, in the past I used to be in two or three online communities (thats where I got to know my boyfriend), but ever since we got a serious relationship, we both deleted all of our accounts. 

Lately, I feel that I am missing out on an important part of gay life. The brother of my bf is also gay and has been helping us renovate our flat (he's a craftsman) and compared to my bf and myself, he is much more open or ""aggressive"" with his homosexuality. He regularly visits Cologone (which is kind of the gay ""capital"" of Germany), even thinks about getting a secondary flat for the weekends there, goes to gay parties and clubs in our area, never misses out on CSD parades, you get the idea. In the past, I used to think that I do not want to do all those things, but in the last few weeks I began to feel - almost jealous, as if I have missed out on something. It feels like my bf and I live in a bubble - we are gay, even openly gay, but we (intentionally) have no contact to other gays, we do not have a single gay friend. 

So, yesterday I suggested to my bf that I would like to go to the CSD in Cologone in summer (would be the first time ever for me), but he says that he has absolutely no interest in that. When my bf was younger, he had a bit more contact to the gay scene, went to some partys etc. - but he says he is through with that. 

Part of me knows that I cannot expect that he just understands my sudden change of heart (since in the past, I have been very adamant that I do not want to have contact with the gay community, and I am ashamed to admit the main reason for that was jealousy that my bf might meet other guys, and before I met him it was fear, I did not have the guts to go to a gay club by myself). And also, I am not even sure WHY I suddenly feel so different about the matter or why the lack of gay activities and friends in our life just suddenly started to bother me so much, but the feeling remains.

So, sorry for the rant, to most of you it must feel like complaining about first world problems - but what do you guys think? Have I missed out on something? Or are those feelings completely unwarranted?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi, I&amp;#39;m a long time lurker who finally decided to post something. 
I&amp;#39;m in my mid-twenties, have a boyfriend (for 3+ years) whom I&amp;#39;m living together with, and I am out to nearly all my friends and family. So far, so good - but I live in a small city in Germany (about 30.000 people) and never have been in much contact with the gay community, in the past I used to be in two or three online communities (thats where I got to know my boyfriend), but ever since we got a serious relationship, we both deleted all of our accounts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lately, I feel that I am missing out on an important part of gay life. The brother of my bf is also gay and has been helping us renovate our flat (he&amp;#39;s a craftsman) and compared to my bf and myself, he is much more open or &amp;quot;aggressive&amp;quot; with his homosexuality. He regularly visits Cologone (which is kind of the gay &amp;quot;capital&amp;quot; of Germany), even thinks about getting a secondary flat for the weekends there, goes to gay parties and clubs in our area, never misses out on CSD parades, you get the idea. In the past, I used to think that I do not want to do all those things, but in the last few weeks I began to feel - almost jealous, as if I have missed out on something. It feels like my bf and I live in a bubble - we are gay, even openly gay, but we (intentionally) have no contact to other gays, we do not have a single gay friend. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, yesterday I suggested to my bf that I would like to go to the CSD in Cologone in summer (would be the first time ever for me), but he says that he has absolutely no interest in that. When my bf was younger, he had a bit more contact to the gay scene, went to some partys etc. - but he says he is through with that. &lt;/p&gt;

And also, I am not even sure WHY I suddenly feel so different about the matter or why the lack of gay activities and friends in our life just suddenly started to bother me so much, but the feeling remains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, sorry for the rant, to most of you it must feel like complaining about first world problems - but what do you guys think? Have I missed out on something? Or are those feelings completely unwarranted?&lt;/p&gt;

I'm a huge fan of the subreddit and finally decided to post a few questions of my own.

I'm 25M and am out to only a few people close to me.  A year ago a met a guy on grindr, with the intent to find a fwb situation.  I wasn't looking for a bf (I was curious/bi at the time), I was too busy and also didn't want to deal with the coming out aspect at the time.  We both lucked out as he wanted the same thing, except he is out and open about his sexuality.  Over the year I've been away for random amounts of time travelling for work, he has been incredibly busy with his own work and so we've been on and off hooking up with no real steadiness.  More recently we've met up to hang out and hook up three times over a month and a half (which is a lot for us).  This past weekend something twigged and I started to realize that I'm beginning to have feelings towards him.  This is the first time I've been emotionally attracted to a guy, and I'm a bit lost about how to go on from here.

The reasons I feel lost are pretty much this:

- our relationship is based upon friendship and sex, without emotional attraction.  I'm not sure if I keep going along with this setup how it will affect me or him and what may happen in the end.
- I feel that we don't know each extremely well.  We talk about work, friends, travelling and other stuff going on in our lives.  We haven't spoken much about the past and none of our friends know about our arrangement (or that the other one exists for that matter).  He's really respectful of the fact that I'm not out.
- I'm caught off guard, and didn't see this coming.  We cuddle while watching movies and after sex we spoon (I spend the night) and I'm not sure if these things have made me feel that emotional attraction.  I don't even know how he feels and don't want to ruin a good thing we have by telling him I'm attracted to him emotionally.

So I'm really nervous about navigating my upcoming wedding planning and the  involvement of my unsupporting(ish) parents.

So the background is that I've been dating my bf for ~2 years. I came out to my parents (conservative, Southern Baptists) about a year ago. They took it better than I expected, but eventually they started criticizing me for being *deceitful* -- i.e. I should've come out sooner, I shouldn't have hidden that I had a bf or was involved in queer advocacy, asking if I had any other ""secrets."" Things settled down, and they started opening up to my bf and me being gay. 

I have a brother, and when I came out to him -- actually, my parents outed me to him -- he took it rough. We are really close, and he hated that I didn't tell him. I understood that, and I started working to repair our relationship. In August, my bf proposed to me, and my brother was the first person I told. He was one week from going off to college, and begged me not to tell my parents until he left. (Some events over the summer strained his relationship with my parents, and he wanted to avoid the extra stress his last week home.) But, of course, when I finally told my parents, they were furious that I waited to tell them (a week). Again came the rhetoric that I was being deceitful. Later, they continued to be more and more open.

Now, my fiancé and I are starting to plan for the wedding, and this past weekend, we made an appointment to visit a venue this Saturday. It was kinda spontaneous, because this place has a lot of stuff we're looking for. I literally just called my mom, and told her about the appointment. In broad terms, I mentioned that if she wanted to come, she could. She flat out refused -- again angrily saying that it's bad timing, I waited til the last minute, etc. etc.

So my questions: Am I crazy in thinking that this ""deceit"" criticism is just misplaced anger at me being gay? Sure, I don't tell them everything the day it occurs -- but I don't think I'm being slow or deceitful, and that, if I were straight, I wouldn't be receiving this criticism.

How do I, if at all, engage them in the wedding planning? It's like a catch-22: if I get them involved, they're gonna be mad at me every step of the way... if I don't, then it'll reaffirm their ""deceitful"" narrative in a big way.

Am 25 and newly in the process of coming out as bi (though probably lean toward gay). Told my mom and a few friends in the last 3 months which felt like big steps, but lots of work to still be done... 

One of the biggest obstacles for me has been that I work in development and currently live in West Africa, where being open isn't really an option. Planning to head back to the developed world in the next little while, but for now I'm here and coping. 

I had been thinking to take a week or two off work and go to South Africa starting next week for some R&amp;R, and also to explore my gay side a bit more :). Then today I saw online that Cape Town Pride is next week, which got me both excited and also nervous. For someone who hasn't had much direct exposure to gay life, do you think this would be an overwhelming and scary experience? Or perhaps a reinforcing and awesome one? Would love any thoughts, either based on Pride experiences in general, or Cape Town's events in particular. Thanks!

He was very against this idea at first but I was pretty persistent about it. Now we both seem to be enjoying it and I felt that we have been more open and happy than ever.

The issue: my boyfriend got gonorrhea and I didn't. We had taken a trip to NYC, hooked up with 2 different people (only oral) and about a week after, he developed some off-color goo under is foreskin. I should note that I circumcised and he is not. Turns out it's gonorrhea. After he got the news, I went in and got tested. Turns out I'm clean. We did have sex before we found out he had it yet I still didn't contract it.

So guys, do you think my boyfriend cheated on me? It seems hard for me to believe because we literally spend all our time out of work together and hang out with the same people. I chalked it up to the fact that he's uncut and has a bigger urethra opening where bacteria could get and multiply. 

Anyway, what do you guys think?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some background: We&amp;#39;re both 22, live together, and have been together for over 2 years.

I, on the other hand, much prefer to snuggle/cuddle as often as possible.  It is torture to me to have this guy who I am insanely attracted to and in love with sitting 3 feet from me, and not being able to be in physical contact with him.

I've talked with him about it and he 1) gets better about it for a few days then resorts back to not wanting to touch, and 2) says things that make me feel needy.  I always tell him I'm ""in trouble for loving him too much"", which feels like the truth a lot of the time.  

Anyone deal with this from either side of the relationship?

We'd been chatting on one gay app or another for about a month and decided to meet up. He texted about an hour before the date and asked to push it back 30 mins because of work stuff, which was fine.  
  
I showed up at the new time, on time. Texted him. He was ten minutes out. I waited. Ten minutes. Twenty Minutes. 30 minutes after we were supposed to get together, he showed up.  
  
(Note: I know how I feel about the showing up late thing, so the important stuff is what happened later)  
 
We had a typical first date: drinks, shared plates, talk of comic books and cartoons and serial killers. Awkward silences, stupid questions, smiles. It was...*okay*.  
  
The date was ending, and we split the bill, and I asked him while waiting for our cards back what his weekend plans were.  
  
Him: ""Hmm...Oh. I have a two month old daughter.""  
  
Apparently he didn't know how to bring up the fact that he is living with his best friend, and she wanted a kid, so they decided to do that together.  
  
I'm just at a loss as to what I should be thinking (my friends think I need a life coach to help me pick better men).
