Anyway, my boyfriend was working a couple of  overnight shifts and left his tablet at home. He has growlr and grindr and claims to only use it to keep in touch with a few people.  The other day, I asked him if he's sent anything... risqué and he said no. We had a talk around new years because I found out he was sending nudes to people on growlr / grindr and flirting with them in a way he doesn't flirt with me. Talking about rimming them and stuff like that. 

So I got on his tablet last night because I just had the feeling of dread  and I just needed to know if he is still sending those pictures. 

There was only one conversation that he had with someone on grindr and he was again flirting with the guy -more talk of rimming, etc. I checked the date and I was home at the time he was flirting and was just in the other room.  All other conversations were cleared on both apps, except the ones where a guy messaged him and he didn't respond. 

What should I do? Is this type of behavior normal ? Could this potentially be the reason why he's not as sexually active with me (he's wishing he was with someone else type thing)

On top of that, he sent the exact same line that he used to start talking to me and then said ""I tell only the hottest guys that, but I've only ever meant it with you""

I know I'm a dick for invading his privacy. That's not what this is about. I'm terrified that I'm not in a serious relationship when I'm legitimately hoping I could spend my life with this man. 

Any and all advice is welcome and appreciative. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I feel like I&amp;#39;m asking for help every day on here. &lt;/p&gt;

Boyfriend of 5 months has brought up his first love often in the first few weeks we were dating and then it stopped but the last couple of months he's brought him up every other week and last night I was a bit alarmed when he told me he went to a psychic who told him he would meet the ""love of his life"" at a certain age and when he reached that age that's when he met this guy. Then I come to find out he dated this dude for 3 months! Two of those months were long distance. I could understand if it was 3 years, even a year but a couple of months? He told me early on in our dating that he still loves him but it didn't bother me because we were in that dating phase but now that we're serious, I looked back on it and it hurts. It's been 12 years since then. It's been 4 years since I last saw my ""first love"" and I really had strong feelings for him, yet he is the furthest thing from my mind and I've only brought him up maybe three times since being with my boyfriend. Should I bring this up to my boyfriend about it bothering me? The reason I'm asking is because we've been bickering too much lately because I'm being honest with him about certain things that bother me. He's already told me what bothers him about me and I've taking it but he seems to be taking it harder. Ex: He smoked a cigarette a few weeks ago and that really bothered me because I'm a former smoker and it was like hell for me to quit, on top of that he criticizes me often for my sometimes poor diet and makes a comment if I have a beer so yeah I got mad when he smoked a cigarette. I told him not to kiss me for the next two days and he got really offended. It didn't turn into a big fight but it turned into a lot of bickering. So we finally just got over that and now this shit with the ""First love"" is starting. Am I overreacting and should just let it go? I'll be the first to admit that sometimes I can be over dramatic.

Alright, so sometime in either November or January I get a month off work as part of my paid leave/break. I want to travel to Colombia, Argentina and Brazil over of my course of 3/4 weeks off. All the cities that I'm thinking of visiting are all very gay friendly, so I don't think it would be much of an issue, though I've heard that Brazil and Colombia are very dangerous; is this true?

Also one other thing I wanted to ask, how much money would be best for me to have saved to have a comfortable trip (being travelling to different cities, staying in hotels, food, night life etc)? I was looking at air fares to Colombia (which is where I wanted to start off the holiday) and they cost between $1,300 to $2,100 (live in Sydney, Aus). 

So if you bros could help out with some ideas on places to visit, travel advice, gay hot spots, best times to go and experiences that you or someone you know have experienced in these countries, it would be all appreciated.

I am seeking some experience and advice on going from best friends to more than that. A little backstory first:
About three years ago I got went to a rehab and got sober from a bad addiction to prescription pills. During my stay, I met a gay man, ""Rich,"" who was getting sober as well. At this time, I was 22, very insecure with my sexuality (but out) and overall just really lost (years of drug abuse will do that.) Richard, though newly sober as well, did have a handle on the whole gay thing and was much more comfortable in his own skin. He is also a little older than me. We both got out of treatment and started to hangout afterwards. Going to meetings, getting coffee, etc. The sobriety piece is important because in recovery you do a lot of work that is very revealing and creates really deep connection with those around you. Going beyond the surface type stuff. This caused Rich and I to become really close and began hanging out on a daily basis. After knowing each other for about 6 mos, he came to me and told me that he wanted to be more than friends. I was really shocked, did not see it coming at all. I was really nervous and said I didn't want to ruin our friendship. What I meant was, I would love to be with you that way but I am too fucking scared (I had then and still have never had a boyfriend.) 

We decided to remain friends and that was about a year and a half ago. In that year in a half, we have become even closer. We have moved in together, do almost everything together and are both happily sober and productive. About a month after I told him we should be friends, he met a guy and they dated for almost a year. I was insanely jealous the entire time. They had a messy break up and I made the mistake of hooking up with best friends ex. At the time, it caused a lot of strife between Rich and I. Ultimately, the experience brought us even closer and the ex is completely out of the picture. 

Which brings us to today and why I am here. In the year and a half since he proposed we be together, I have grown immensely and have become much more comfortable with being who I am, a gay man. I think I am in love with Rich, even though I don't really know what that means. I think I am ready and willing to be with him in that way, and to be in a relationship in general. We are essentially together in that way anyways, minus the sex. My question to you guys is, do you think it would be appropriate for me to bring it up, since I shot it down in the first place. Do you think if I did bring it up, we could be back where we started, only this time HE would say no? Have any of you guys ever experienced transitioning from best friend to lovers? How did it work?  Any and all feedback is so appreciated. The fact that you have read this far is appreciated too! ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello gaybros!

A buddy of mine has talked about asking questions on Reddit, so I figured I'd ask here… Hope I'm asking in the right place!

Anyway, I'm a 21 year old dude living and studying in Cali. I have a job which doesn't pay well, and fucking hate with a passion. A friend of mine who is gay suggested that Go Go dancing could help with my financial situation. Now, I've experimented with guys in College and enjoyed some of the encounters, so having men all up in my business wouldn't be an issue for me at all (guys give better head by the way). 

I don't really care what people think about me, my experiences or thoughts on Go Go Dancing, but it seems like there is a stigma when it comes to professions like that? I'm really in a pickle here, because I've enjoyed going to gay bars here in Cali &amp; New York and really loved the atmosphere. 

So, I want to ask, what are the benefits of Go Go Dancing at gay bars? What would the money be like/tips? I'm really considering it because my financial situation is only going to get worse if I don't pick up a second job. 

If it's any consolation, I am a 5'11 dude, lean and weigh 174 lbs with a Middle Eastern background. Would that help in my application or decision for a place to hire me?

There was no drama last night, we sat down and talked like adults, mostly calmly. He came clean to everything. He hooked up with someone during a time when we were fighting he assumed we were taking time off. It was a drunk fuckup which he regrets. He knows he has a problem, he's not perfect and that he's really trying. He realizes what he could've done to my health and that's the part that was killing him the most. Says his love never changed for me and doesn't see himself with anyone else. He's not expecting me to take him and he would respect that decision. I believe him.

Now, none of you know us and it's very easy to type ""dump his ass, you deserve better "" etc. but I am truly happy with him, he is everything I wanted(except that part). Our relationship is pretty fucking amazing, it looks almost perfect to the outside world.  We're young, successfully, have a big social circle of friends. We live in a big gay community so the temptations are everywhere. Gym, local coffee shops, neighbors, or even just going grocery shopping, homos are everywhere, and we are not even talking about the apps. Knowing myself, even though I've been faithful in this relationship so far, I will screw up one day too, I know it. He knows it. It's inevitable. It's hard for me personally to believe that this is the reality of gay relationships or at least in this city, but I agree, everyone screws up sooner or later. 

**Tldr:** according to someone in the comments, we are both idiots and we deserve each other. 


**Edit:** I don't get why a lot of you taking it so personally. I said since the first post, I'm not going to leave him. I don't care how cliche it sounds, but I care for him.  It's work in progress. I believe in him and I believe he's honestly trying. If you're mentally and emotionally not strong enough to handle it, then why be so aggressive? I don't get it. 
It might sound like I'm defending him, but I'm not. It hurts as fuck but I will mess up too, I know it. Unless we open it up(which we are not) or play together(not opposed).

/u/LimivorousArbour summed it perfectly. Thank you. 

Whoever is saying that they are perfect and will never screw up in a relationship, you are lying to yourself. Many of us were there before.

We had another long talk this morning. A little background

him: came to America a few months before we started dating. He's into bears. He is not a bear.

me: non-white. I am a bear. I'm into non-bears.

He revealed to me that he came to the realization that he's into middle-aged white bears, which he never really was exposed to in his country.  So, this is not really good news for my youthful-looking, bearish self. 

I asked if he's into this type exclusively and he said no, but it's a priority for him.  I told him that I have a similar ranking system of types myself. But it's not a deal breaker for me if someone doesn't fit the #1 type (he doesn't). 

But that's what get his fire going at the moment. He was highly attracted to me and past boyfriends (similar ethnicities, ages, and bears), and had great relationships with all of us. I'm not sure why now.

So, now, he tells me that he's finding the apps very, empty, shallow; it's all about sex-sex-sex (so I know he didn't cheat on me). And I am like ""what did you expect?"" He doesn't know what to do. He suggested again we tried to get back together to make things less awkward between us, but again, I told him that is the wrong reason. It's interesting, he mentioned in his profile that he's looking to be in a relationship with a guy with qualities that fit me to a T.  Everything but the physical part.

So this is where we're at now. As I said this was my first serious relationship, and I expected to be in bad shape over this.  I do cry and get sad at random times throughout the day, but I am able to function and at the same time be very objective about helping him. He hasn't been able to function though. And oddly enough, I am there helping him out. And it's not really phasing me. I don't know. I love this bastard. But he needs to figure things out before I take him back.  Am I fucking crazy or what?

He's seeking help tomorrow.  The counselor specializes in gay men and we may go see the counselor as a couple. But he's going alone for now.

Turns out he is bisexual (he told me about his ex girlfriend and ex boyfriend...) now I think he dislikes me.

We both hang out at this game store a lot and recently I have been picking him up from his house and sending him home. I've done this a couple times and he does live far away from where I live so I guess I am being extra-nice to him I guess because I like him. Before he knew I liked him on a day I picked him up we went out and got some food before heading to the game store.

It really annoys me that other people are doing better than me that don't deserve it - some people I know, in their free time they like to go out and do drugs and treat their families like shit. Yet they still have good jobs that pay a decent amount.


And finally, I doubt anyone would even want to go out with me. I've got an average body but my face is ugly.

I'm graduating college this month at age 22, already got a job waiting in Baltimore, and have a lovely boyfriend of 3 years going with me. However, the area I'm not really happy with is my family, particularly my mother.

To preface the issue, over spring break, I visited Baltimore to see the city, and my moth wanted to come along. I got permission from the bf, and I was a little worried. To be honest now, I wish I never invited her. She made offensive comments about gay people( when trying to be accommodating?), met a friend and introduced us as friends which I would be fine with it if she only did that for the first time, overbearing the whole trip, eventually gave up looking at places she didn't like, and kept insinuating that my boyfriend and I were gonna break up. I gave her benefit to the doubt, because my father and her just got divorced, but it came a constant conversation about breaking up. It felt she like was trying to say she was not a fan of my boyfriend. My family also knows I'm gay, because I told them 2.5 years ago. However, no one past my immediate family knows, so I always talk about the bf as a friend and quickly drop the subject around them. Honestly, I'm really tired of this.
 

Up to today, I recently got an email about receiving an award in my major's department, and it says you can take two guests. Of course, upon receiving the news, I screenshotted the message and sent it to my parents. Well, my mom then reached out to me wanting to go, and the trip revisited my mind. However, I am going to take care of this and wanted advice on my response. I am going to respond back but something along the lines I am more than happy for her to want to come, but I want her to know in my years at college with my adviser and peers  I've acknowledged that I have a boyfriend/partner, not a friend. I can understand if she is have yet to accept my sexuality, but I'm not letting her dictate who my boyfriend is on my turf (i.e. campus, where I live now, not at home). Is that reasonable?

Overall, this boils down to now I've been in a stable relationship for three years where we talked about marriage, kids, settling down, etc, I'm tired of being in the closet past my immediate family. I would love to the opportunity to have my boyfriend meet my cousins, aunts, uncles, etc and join in the fun get-togethers they have. They are not fun to me without him or having to refer to him as my friend or roommate, which I only did previously to keep some people happy which I realize now is not making me happy.

To end this, am I reasonable to send that message to my mom about the awards ceremony? Apart of me thinks it's about time I stand up and be myself in a sense, because I already have a plan to once I get settled in Baltimore  I plan to come out on facebook and open up my interested in and relationship status to friends, so my actual family can see it.

To be honest now, I wish I never invited her. She made offensive comments about gay people( when trying to be accommodating?), met a friend and introduced us as friends which I would be fine with it if she only did that for the first time, overbearing the whole trip, eventually gave up looking at places she didn&amp;#39;t like, and kept insinuating that my boyfriend and I were gonna break up. I gave her benefit to the doubt, because my father and her just got divorced, but it came a constant conversation about breaking up. It felt she like was trying to say she was not a fan of my boyfriend. My family also knows I&amp;#39;m gay, because I told them 2.5 years ago. However, no one past my immediate family knows, so I always talk about the bf as a friend and quickly drop the subject around them. Honestly, I&amp;#39;m really tired of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up to today, I recently got an email about receiving an award in my major&amp;#39;s department, and it says you can take two guests. Of course, upon receiving the news, I screenshotted the message and sent it to my parents. Well, my mom then reached out to me wanting to go, and the trip revisited my mind. However, I am going to take care of this and wanted advice on my response. I am going to respond back but something along the lines I am more than happy for her to want to come, but I want her to know in my years at college with my adviser and peers  I&amp;#39;ve acknowledged that I have a boyfriend/partner, not a friend. I can understand if she is have yet to accept my sexuality, but I&amp;#39;m not letting her dictate who my boyfriend is on my turf (i.e. campus, where I live now, not at home). Is that reasonable?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, this boils down to now I&amp;#39;ve been in a stable relationship for three years where we talked about marriage, kids, settling down, etc, I&amp;#39;m tired of being in the closet past my immediate family. I would love to the opportunity to have my boyfriend meet my cousins, aunts, uncles, etc and join in the fun get-togethers they have. They are not fun to me without him or having to refer to him as my friend or roommate, which I only did previously to keep some people happy which I realize now is not making me happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To end this, am I reasonable to send that message to my mom about the awards ceremony? Apart of me thinks it&amp;#39;s about time I stand up and be myself in a sense, because I already have a plan to once I get settled in Baltimore  I plan to come out on facebook and open up my interested in and relationship status to friends, so my actual family can see it. &lt;/p&gt;

Last night we argued about things that bother us in the relationship and one of the things that he said to me is that I'm fat (implying that he doesn't feel attracted to me anymore).
He also said that he likes sex ""as soon as we start it"" but sometimes he cannot be bothered.
See, I'm not really tall (179cm, 79kg) and sometimes I do feel that I'm fat. The thing is, I lost all my confidence and I'm really disappointed because he seemed like a really shallow person. Between all the things that he wants to change in me, my appearance is the first one that comes to his mind. 
When we argue is always because I cannot stand the amount of weed that he used to smoke, or because he is emotionally immature, or because I'm being a bitch.
I love him, I really do. He's such a sweet and nice guy, and we are really good together but I don't know how to take this and I would like to hear from someone else.
