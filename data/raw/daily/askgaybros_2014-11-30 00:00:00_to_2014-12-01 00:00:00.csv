I'm 25, parents still don't know but I came out about 2 years ago to straight bros, no problem. Before that I had a girlfriend for a bit over a year. Straight bros had set us up and being the looker smart girl she was, if I refused it wouldn't look right. My luck was her parents were really REALLY strict she always had an early curfew and I work full time most days, or had an excuse. I was 22 she 19. It was a really exhausting year+. The very few times where we could have sex I wouldn't be able to perform. Before her the same happened with 3 other girls (thanks straight bros).

Finally Im just too tired to keep it up (no pun intended) and being the huge fucking pussy I am I write her a long message on facebook about how I'm gay yadda yadda. She thinks I'm lying to break up with her and its a joke from a friend and calls my roommate/best friend at the time. He logs on my name and reads it. He doesn't give a shit but she asks me to keep trying with her. In the middle of all the tears i cant help but give in. Prom was in a couple of weeks and she wouldn't be able to get another date. At prom it sinks in things wouldn't be back to ""normal"". A few parents still might still know me as ""the guy who made the prom queen cry"" in her town. I felt like a huge fucking dick.

Hes where I start getting worried. Oh yea, my roommate/best bud? I like him. Like like. We do everything together. After he found out I was gay we still did everything together. Slept over my place most nights after we moved. It sucked. He too was also really cute and I was always around to see him get the girls. One night we get home drunk after a party and I wake up to him jacking off next to me in bed. It was pretty one sided I help him out, tried to kiss him, get his shirt off, doesn't happen, he tries going in dry, really doesn't happen. Got weird we go to sleep. I don't get hard at all though any of it. I was still really shit faced and blame it on the whiskey.

Fast forward a year and I come out to straight bros. Gay clubs get brought up but I refuse. Just not my thing. So to the apps I go. Find a guy, said he was 28 but was actually 30. Good looking guy. We watch a movie I have 3 beers he has half of 1. He makes his move we go the bedroom. I cant get hard. He was pretty nice about it. Asks if something is wrong but don't know how to answer. Don't ever message him back after that.

2nd time a year after, meet a guy at a bar. Not exactly true to his profile either but my age and seem pretty cool. Not very attracted to him but I feel like I just wanted to do it so I could just have it out of my head! We go back to his place. Same problem. Cant say whats wrong we try again a few days later and same. He tries to top but that shit fucking hurts. I delete his number.

Just now it happened again. Nice good looking kid. Though it was in his car in some parking lot. I feel like every time I know I'm going to get down to it my penis just seems to freeze up. Literally though, it actually feels colder and stays that way for a while after. I'm definitely not very comfortable with hooking up with someone I just met but even with a guy I was into for a while, in my bed, couldn't do it. Its very frustrating. 

I check out this place every once in a while and just wondering if anyone has maybe been through the same thing or knows what the fuck I should do! Other then maybe cutting down on the daily dosage of porn...

First things first, I know I am not the only one who has this problem but please here me out. I am also new here and I don't know if this is the right place to say this, but I recently saw a post about a father who accidentally found out that his son is gay and asked an advice on how to deal with it (in which he was very accepting --- which i envy). Also, English is not my mother tongue so ... Yeah.


I knew that I am gay (or at least I am not the normal ""boy who likes girls"") since preschool. I thought I was just confused but when I went to college and had a crush with a guy, I realized that I am indeed gay. For the longest time, I am keeping this as a secret because I grew up in a place where gays aren't really welcome and that the idea of being gay is something that is laughed at, mocked at and worse, treating you as though you were a criminal. This isn't exactly the United States where people are at least somewhat more accepting of gay people. I also grew up in a homophobic family, who thinks being gay is a disease and that it can be reversed. Whenever I am with them and they see gay people, they shout at them, curse at them, what have you.


That is why it didn't occur to me to tell them that I am gay, not even once....well, before. Now, I am 21 years old already, currently in medical school, and I've never been in a relationship because, you know, people expect me to have a girlfriend. I thought that I'll be happy without being in love or meeting a special someone, being alone, but no. Things are changing and I do not want to experience that. This predicament has been affecting my current emotional state and my performance in medical school. I have also been following a number of LGBT websites where i read coming out stories. I am jealous of the people who had the courage to tell their family. Moreover, I am jealous of the people who became true to themselves.


BUT i don't think I can be one of these people. Not only will I be disappointing my family, they might also reject me and ask me to leave. Based on what I've seen before regarding their views on gay people, this is not impossible. They have been asking if I am gay, and I always tell them that I am not. And they're response: ""Good."" Good?!! That I am not gay? Because apparently it is despicable to be one.


Then again, I am really depressed right now and feel like I am a bomb that can explode anytime, so I already want them to know and I want to be true to myself. When I saw the post regarding the father who accidentally found out that his son is gay, I've been meaning to tell my family that I am gay and hoping that they have the same reaction (which is very unlikely). So I don't know what to do and I feel helpless. I don't go out much anymore and I am just using medical school as a reason to not go out. But real reason is that I can't pretend to people that I am not gay. There were times when I wish I wasn't born gay.


So here I am asking for advice. I will really appreciate it and thanks in advance.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay.

Problem is I'm being inconsistent. There'll be a few weeks where I'm really excited about working out, looking for jobs, meeting people on Grindr, infrequent as that may be, and overall I just feel like I'm on top of things.

I didn't know they were dating, or that Jake was gay. 

I learned from my friend that they've been official for like a month and that Jake came out a couple months ago. He told me this before he realized that Jake hadn't come out to me yet. I should've just told him that I didn't know about it before allowing him to unknowingly out Jake, but hearing my best friend had a boyfriend just got me curious. 

My friend felt horrible about having outed Jake, he figured I would've been the first to know. I mean I figured the same thing, but obviously I know this is Jake's thing to do as he feels most comfortable doing   I agreed to just pretend I didn't know, and just act normal. But now I feel like I'm lying to Jake by not telling him that I know. The three of us hung out today (me, Jake, the boyfriend) and it feels weird now knowing what I know.

Plus I'm worried that I'm doing something that's making Jake feel like he can't tell me. And if I am I want to stop doing that, friends shouldn't be uncomfortable around each other.

So I've started to become really self conscious about myself. My face, body and *especially* my penis size. I'm about 2-3"" flaccid and 5-5.5"" erect. I know this is supposed to be an average sized penis... but every last guy i have been with is sizably larger. It's not even length, but in girth too.

I feel so inadequate. A really hot guy on grindr was talking to me tonight and when he sent some pics I actually found myself asking ""Why are YOU talking to ME?"" He's handsome, intelligent, well built and very hung... and all I could think about was why someone like him was wasting his time on someone like me.

I feel like some people would think ""Most guys DREAM of being with larger guys, why on earth is this a bad thing for you?"" It's just that I feel like I'm not bringing as much to the table, you know? It makes me feel tiny, insecure and undeserving. I think the guy I've been talking to and dating picked up on it, and was commenting on how ""perfect"" my size is. Most guys say that when they either see or hear how small I am. It feels condescending. They might mean well but at the same time I can't help but feel that they are sort of trying to make me feel better for being small, unlike them.

I know this is a stupid train of thought. But I also know it's common in gay people.

On our third date, he asked me to wait for him and try to figure it out. My initial response was this is too much too soon. But since then, my feelings have gotten deeper and so have his. After much thought today, and the first day of not seeing him, I decided to go for it and wait for him. But now I feel him pushing away a bit and doesn't want to have anything serious anymore. 

We're going to meet up for our possible last time tomorrow. It's going to be a tough day for us both. My only thought is do I push for my first boyfriend to be in the Air Force so far away, do I end it as it is and keep doing my thing, or do we just see where writing each other goes and deal with it if someone else comes along?

When bottoming I never come close to enjoying it. I don't orgasm unless I'm really jerking off (which I find hard to do if a guy is thrusting) and I don't feel any ""prostate pleasure"" like I've been told is supposed to happen.

I know the guy is hitting my prostate because I ""ooze"" a lot of precum and I can feel it hitting that area and making me feel the need to pee. But other than mild discomfort of having something in my ass I feel nothing whatsoever. I have a dildo and it feels similar.

I've never even been close to feeling anything. This has had a negative impact on my self-esteem when approaching guys, especially as it might mean I'm bad in bed. Not that I'm terribly self-conscious.

I probably have death-grip syndrome and usually only I can make myself cum (blowjobs and handjobs from others do nothing), and because I don't have much sensation I have a hard time topping. 

What I'm wondering is, is this common? Do a lot of other guys have no pleasure when they bottom? What can I do?

I'm wondering if it's has something to do with when I was little. Whenever I would feel the need to take a dump, I would hold it in as long as possible.

I uh got caught on gay hookup apps or porn when i was younger and my parents don't trust me much at all. They can also track me using a find my friends app on their iphones and while i can and have turned it off, i usually turn it back on soon after because i'm scared they'll freak out that i'm not on it. So... Oh. Sex and stuff. Well, i'm on a ton of apps and websites, but it seems like i can't get what i want. Sex either i'm too picky, the guys are too picky/dont respond (i'm also kind of nervous about it since ive only topped once and... its complicated) but more importantly, i have time tuesday and thursday where no ones home and i usually think thats a good time to do it (though again, nervousness and shit make it hard). The bigger problem though is guys cant do it at that time. So, to sum that little part up, i cant fuck when the guys i want to can. And then theres relationships. I'd love one, and am on okcupid but i'm constantly ignored it seems so i kinda have given up. It's either sex (which i cant get much of) or nothing since relationships are hard to find.

TLDR: My life is a mess and i'm not sure that even if i find the solution (EX: talk to parents) i'm brave enough to do it. Just thought i'd ask you guys what you think.

[Post 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/2jomok/long_distance_relationship_update/)
It's been awhile since I've posted about my long distance relationship. My boyfriend and I became official last month, and have been talking for 6 months now. We have continued to talk everyday and grow closer. He started a new job recently and my school schedule is getting busier, so we are adjusting.
Yesterday we met up in his hometown again. We went to a calm bar with two of his close friends, one of whom he came out to just to introduce me. Afterwards his friends left and we got time to ourselves. Although the long distance is hard, we are making it work. I hope this post inspires other GayBros to give long distance a try. It has its drawbacks, but when we finally do get a chance to see each other, it becomes more than worth the challenges.

there's this guy I had been seeing for a few weeks during the summer. I really liked him but he did some stuff that made me feel unhappy, like inviting me to go out with him and his friends on one day, and acting like he didn't invite me on the next day or calling off our dates really often and not giving a reason. I tried to subtly pressure him to tell me what's up and he finally told me in a text message that he thinks he ""can't give me what i want/expect"" and ended it.

A few weeks ago he messaged me again and we met up and talked about it. He told me he acted like that because there was this guys he hadn't been over yet. But now he was and he would like me to get to know how he really is like because he thought we did kinda fit.

Problem is that i feel like I'm still mad about him for calling it off and I think I sabotage our dates with my bad mood. I can't really enjoy my time with him altough I still think he's a great guy most of the time. I still have my doubts about him cause he already came to the conclusion once that he wants to break it off. I think I was expecting some kind of gesture from him to make it all up, but that never came and anyway, that thought seems so childish... doesn't it?

I don't know what to do... Will that feeling go away?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey bros,&lt;/p&gt;

The reason for us breaking up was that he told me that he wasn't gay at all and that he wanted to have an easier and a normal life. No need to say that this is an statement which i don't end up buying. I mean, he told me that in these last months I've been making him do things he didn't want to, but I'm quite sure that he enjoyed them apart that I've never told him to do anything he doesn't want to.

Perhaps this is what really kills me. I could accept that maybe we weren't meant to be together, or any other reason of that sort, but not that he told me he was scared and wanted a simpler life...

I also have to see him almost everyday, and every single one he reminds me why i loved him because he is a really wonderful person, but also that most probably I'll never be with him again. 

He also gets sad when I'm not OK. She spoke by phone twice i think since we works up and he told me that he stills wants to keep me in his like and that he doesn't like to see me unhappy, and that i should look to the future. And every time he sees me sad when we are around, we tells me “again with that sad face? Whats wrong?"" And i have to bite my tongue not to tell him that i fucking miss him so hard, but that everything is fine...

I just don't know.... i miss him and love him so bad. Everyday i wake up with this void in my chest because i remember him. I also have the fantasy that eventually he'll realise that a ""normal"" and ""easier"" it's not what he wants and that we'll end up together. What do you think i came do to feel better?
