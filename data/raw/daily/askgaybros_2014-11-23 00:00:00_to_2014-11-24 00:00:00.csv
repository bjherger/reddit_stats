He is 26 (I'm 23) and of a higher position than I am (but I don't report to him directly) and gay.
During my first few week of working, we rarely speak to one another, not until one night where everyone in work were invited to a night-out-drinking-session. He gotten really drunk, and asked me whether or not I was gay. I didn't reply him initially, but after a few more tries, I just told him yes. And he gave me a really friendly hug and smiled. After a few more drinks, he was just too drunk to walk, so I had to take care of him. He asked for me to kiss him, and although I wanted to, I told him I don't want to kiss him drunk and not like that. So what I did was just gave him a few peck of his cheek, a few times.
So this is where our relationship progressed. After that night, we have been flirting, especially when we are alone in the car. We held hands, hugged, and kissed, but not to the point of making out. Last week, while I was driving back, he asked to stop somewhere. Then, it started off with a kiss then we made out (He drank 1 pint of beer before this, so I don't think he was even drunk). The next night, we made out again. All these happened over the weekend.
So, come this work week. It has been really weird between us. I don't know whether it is me that made it awkward or it is him regretting both nights. I do know that at the workplace we should keep it professional. We work at different floors and at different things, so we don't really spend much time in the office. But still, it feels he is distancing himself from me. Then only this week I found out he might not be single. I heard from a colleague that he was in a LDR with someone and was nearing a breakup last month. No one knows whether he broke up or not, but it doesn't really make the situation any better.
After I found out that extra detail of him, I refrained myself from flirting with him. Yesterday during a drive to an event, I tried to not to do anything ""not-friendly"". Half way through the drive, he put his hand on my thighs and asked me whether he could take a nap (he has been overworking the last few days and didn't get much sleep). I told him yes, and I held his hand and allowed him to sleep, and drove like that for the rest of the journey.

So in the past year and so, I've come out to myself, to my friends, and I'm currently out at grad school. I am not, however, out to my parents and extended family. I come from a Middle Eastern background with somewhat religious (Muslim) parents, so the taboo of being gay (and honestly, sex, in general) is beyond huge. 

I don't think they are completely oblivious to the fact of me being gay, honestly, judging by my complete lack of interest in girls, but I think there's a very large denial aspect to it.

Anyways, I'm not sure how to got to this point, but we've grown incredibly distant in the past year. I guess my coping mechanism once I came out was to just isolate myself from everything and everyone that may not accept me - essentially running from the issue, my innate reaction to most difficult things in life. 

So, last night my mom confronted me about the distance while we were talking on the phone and one thing led to another and we got on the topic of my friends, two of whom are a gay couple. Upon giving me some slight assurance that she had no issue with them being my friends, I asked if she would be okay with me being gay, at which point she completely freaked out...I believe her words were ""I think I'm going to have a heart attack"". So naturally once I realized how freaked out she was, I freaked out even harder and totally shut down the conversation. I told her I wasn't feeling well and that I didn't want to talk anymore. 

So at this point, I think she grew concerned that I was about to do something rash like hurt myself (I definitely wasn't), but she became a bit nicer. Today we spoke and it seems like she's pushed the conversation out of her memory and she's acting like everything is fine, although she keeps messaging me every hour or so to check up.

I'm very confused with what is happening and I'm honestly just tired of this. I am comfortable being gay, and its taken me a long time to get to this point. Is it horrible of me to not want unsupportive factors in my life? I hate feeling like I'm back in the closet. I know they are family, and the ones who should know, but they make me feel ashamed of myself. They make me feel inferior and even emasculated. In Arabic, they refer to gay men as the ""third"" sex, essentially demonizing anyone who falls in this category. I simply don't want to be around them, although my friends keep reassuring me that I just need some distance and time.

Anyways, I'm not even sure what I'm asking here, possibly just ranting.. 

I just hate feeling like I can't both be Arab and gay and that the two are incompatible. Some days I get so tempted to just drop everything I'm doing now and move away somewhere to start fresh.. Or at least to a lesser extreme transfer to another school out of state. I'm a little lost and I've got exams in the next couple weeks, so this whole mental turmoil is not really helping. 

I hate saying it cause it's clearly a pointless statement, but the reality of the situation is that this is just unfair. It's unfair and it really pisses me off. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey bros,&lt;/p&gt;

Some days I get so tempted to just drop everything I&amp;#39;m doing now and move away somewhere to start fresh.. Or at least to a lesser extreme transfer to another school out of state. I&amp;#39;m a little lost and I&amp;#39;ve got exams in the next couple weeks, so this whole mental turmoil is not really helping. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate saying it cause it&amp;#39;s clearly a pointless statement, but the reality of the situation is that this is just unfair. It&amp;#39;s unfair and it really pisses me off. &lt;/p&gt;

By ""perfect"" I mean we love each other and there isnt much we wouldnt do for one another. The issue we have is our libido. I think mine is normal and his is very very low. We have sex maybe 1 time a month if Im lucky. Its just very frustrating. Im trying to be understanding. I think he's the kind of person that could be in a relationship and literally never have sex unless he was horny.(thats kind of another related issue - I really hate that we always have to have sex on his schedule and almost never when Im horny). Its not like Im asking for sex every night either. Maybe once or twice a week would be more than enough for me which I think is probably less than average.


I know part of why his libido is so low. Its because of the stress he is under at work. Without trying to get into too much detail, he grad from college and found a job in his field but it was a contract position and when that position was done he couldnt find more work. He went to work at OfficeMax and thru that job met with this guy who was starting a real estate business so he works for him now. Long story short this guy is a complete workaholic and can be rude and condescending. The only reason he stays there is cause it pays well and has decent benefits. He's been trying to learn other skills in his spare time so maybe he can eventually work from home or something.(like creating music or learning to program) Those havent worked out yet though.


Leaving him isnt an option cause one I love him and I would rather be in a sexless loving relationship than be without him.  Secondly I moved from GA to Cali and pretty much burned the bridges with my family doing so. So there is really no going back for me. Id be out on the streets if we broke up, maybe.

He rejects almost anything I try to do to ""help"" relieve his stress. He's a very independent person that doesnt like to ask for help or take help even when he needs it.

I think he also thinks that the sex for me is just like a physical thing. Its not just about me being horny and needing to get off. I feel alot closer to him when we are intimate sexually. All he can think about is the clean up and ""effort"" put into sex. It just kind of hurts that he feels that way. At the same time I can understand not wanting to have sex when youre not horny and all stressed out. Even though he says its not a rejection it feels like that every time he doesnt want to have sex with me.


But he kind of treats everything that way lately. He feels like he has very little personal time since when he gets home there are more things he has to do(like go out with me to do groceries or just errands in general - I would do those if I could but I dont have a car) I try to do things as much around the apartment as I can. I dont work so I have alot of free time. I think I do my part and then some so I try to keep our home life as stress free as possible. Even if I did work I dont think it would help his job situation. His boss requires him to be there 5 days a week all day 9-6, so I dont think that has a bearing on the situation.
What would you guys do in my situation? Just weather it out and see what happens? Its been this way for awhile now. Before he just chose to be happy and was more horny before but I think his job is just getting to him to the point where he cant even fake it for himself anymore.


PS I dont think cheating is an issue either. We both have access at any time to each others iphones/ipads whatever. We dont keep secrets from each other and honestly he doesnt even have time to cheat even if he wanted to. He works so much and is with me pretty much any other time.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So my bf and I pretty much have the &amp;quot;perfect&amp;quot; relationship.

the queer lady community of reddit is absolutely lovely, but I have encountered in other corners of the  L community sometimes people like obsessing over labels and feel entitled to define other's identity for them 

Hypothetical scenario: 
There is a gay dude: one who came out a bit later maybe;he tried having sex with women but it did not work, felt apathetic about  sex with women: did not hate it, but not his kind of thing, only wants to have a relationship with a guy and only lusts after men. 

Occasionally  he notices a girl in a slightly sexual way; he does not want to sleep with her, the attraction does not feel the same as with guys, but let's say she has a nice bum, or a cute haircut, or nice eyes and there is something about her that makes him  slightly curious/attracted to her for a few moments, but not enough to want actually do anything with her. 

In other words he does not lust after her, but  notices her in a way that is not completely devoid of any kind of sensual attraction. 


Now in my books that does not change anything about the fact that he is  is predominantly  gay, but what do you think? 

Would it make the guy who experiences this bisexual? 

If the genders are reversed I often see gay women being told that they really 'bisexual', because they are attracted a bit to men, despite there not being enough attraction to counterbalance the fact that the person is of the non-preferred sex/gender to  actually make them act on it.  Because 'some attraction to the opposite sex= bisexual'! yay!

What is your opinion on this?



Cheers :)




","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;A question from queer  female here! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the queer lady community of reddit is absolutely lovely, but I have encountered in other corners of the  L community sometimes people like obsessing over labels and feel entitled to define other&amp;#39;s identity for them &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hypothetical scenario: 
There is a gay dude: one who came out a bit later maybe;he tried having sex with women but it did not work, felt apathetic about  sex with women: did not hate it, but not his kind of thing, only wants to have a relationship with a guy and only lusts after men. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Occasionally  he notices a girl in a slightly sexual way; he does not want to sleep with her, the attraction does not feel the same as with guys, but let&amp;#39;s say she has a nice bum, or a cute haircut, or nice eyes and there is something about her that makes him  slightly curious/attracted to her for a few moments, but not enough to want actually do anything with her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words he does not lust after her, but  notices her in a way that is not completely devoid of any kind of sensual attraction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now in my books that does not change anything about the fact that he is  is predominantly  gay, but what do you think? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would it make the guy who experiences this bisexual? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the genders are reversed I often see gay women being told that they really &amp;#39;bisexual&amp;#39;, because they are attracted a bit to men, despite there not being enough attraction to counterbalance the fact that the person is of the non-preferred sex/gender to  actually make them act on it.  Because &amp;#39;some attraction to the opposite sex= bisexual&amp;#39;! yay!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is your opinion on this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers :)&lt;/p&gt;

I am rather lucky to have actually fallen for someone for the first time. I'm 21 and after some dates which fizzled out, grindr silliness, and wondering whether I just have too high standards, I actually bumped into a gorgeous chap at a mutual friend's birthday. 

We've been in a relationship for about 3 months so, granted, it isn't exactly long term stability yet. It is, however, the first time I have felt comfortable in opening up emotively to someone. Usually I get critical or unsure, but with him it works... sort of.

The 'rational' or critical side of my brain sometimes takes over and prompts the odds and dangers of a first time relationship of this scale. These things don't last, they usually fail and you feel shit for it. I'm aware this is a risk people take for the 'good times outweigh the fall', but considering how emotively defensive I usually am I doublethink my actions. This is further hampered by a long-distance effect between my intensive University town and his intensive job in my home-town. It is in reality (and you Americans will have a chuckle) only 45 miles away, but we only see each other every 2-3 weeks for a couple of days. I'm home for the vacation holidays which will be nice, but will this eventually become a hindrance...

Maybe I'm being too self-critical - Is this normal? I have dealt with, in a little bit of frustration, a couple of gay mates who became too clingy and involved in their first relationship for it to fail catatonically. I don't really want to end up the same way.

I'm not sure if I'm posting in the right place, but here it goes. I have a wonderfully bright, hilarious, and sweet 12-year-old nephew (I'll call him Kyle here), who identifies himself as bisexual. He's recently been subjected to bullying in school and has expressed suicidal thoughts. I feel like, as an aunt, I'm failing him, and I need advice. To get a better picture of the complexities of the situation, here's some backstory:

* Until a couple years ago, the last time I saw my nephew, he was two. My brother (who it's actually a stepbrother) and his wife divorced when Kyle was 5. She received custody of Kyle and eventually remarried. She died two years ago after a tragic home accident. She was on life support for a month, but it was determined she was brain dead. My brother immediately took custody of Kyle.

* Even though I hadn't seen him since he was a toddler, I was completely heartbroken for him. I wanted to help him, and I knew the school district that my brother lived in was horrible. I found out the house across the street from us was coming up for rent. I talked to the owner and convinced him to rent it out to my brother and his girlfriend. My brother and his girlfriend both work restaurant/bar hours, so I knew they would need someone to be available to babysit Kyle. I helped with taking him to/from school, since my youngest daughter attended the same school. He was at our house while they worked, which was quite a lot. I have two daughters, one that is two years older and one that is two years younger. He loves being around them.

* My brother is an alcoholic. He has been for a long time. My stepmother, his mom, is an alcoholic as well. We grew up in that environment. He doesn't believe there's a problem. He's drunk nearly everyday. He yells at Kyle and has been physically abusive to him. When he calls me while drunk to talk about Kyle, he normally refers to him as an ""asshole."" I've tried to offer advice, but normally he forgets what I've told him our just didn't listen.

* My brother has never sought any kind of grief counseling for Kyle. It's been excuse after excuse. Mostly, he claims he can't find the right time to take him. His ex-wife's parents have even offered to pay for the counseling.

* Kyle came out as bisexual to his dad and my family at about the same time. I was not surprised by it. I told him that I will always love and care about him, no matter what, and I will never judge him. He talks about being attracted to guys with my older daughter when he's over at our house. They watch Supernatural together. He has the hots for Dean. It's cute. When he told his dad, however, his dad told him that he didn't know what he was talking about. He told him he's too young and hasn't been in a relationship before, so he can't know what sexual orientation he is. He said he needs to keep it to himself to prevent him from being bullied.

* Kyle has started to get bullied at school. Other boys have called him faggot and other things. He told me that he's reported it, but the school hasn't done anything about it. 

* He wrote some stuff about suicide a couple weeks ago in English class, and the school called in my brother for a suicide intervention with Kyle. My brother said Kyle didn't mean it and just does stuff to get attention. He is, though, finally starting to talk about getting Kyle some counseling, although I'm highly skeptical. I told my brother he needs to get him some counseling ASAP, so Kyle can start learning the coping skills he so desperately needs. 

* Outside of my daughters, Kyle doesn't have many friends. My brother feels that he's allowed Kyle to spend too much time on social media, thus preventing him from getting out and making friends. He's recently revoked all his electronics and demanded that Kyle give him all of his usernames and passwords for his accounts, which Kyle did. Now, he has no way to contact anyone. This, on top of so much, infuriates me to no end.

* For the past month, I've been taking my daughter to an LGBT youth group once a week. It's mostly for high school aged kids, but I asked if my nephew could attend. They welcomed him, and we initially told his dad it was a youth leadership group. Kyle eventually told his dad that the group was for LGBT kids, and surprisingly, his dad was ok with it. He's still new to the group, and my daughter has told me that he hasn't opened up about much. He loves going, though.

* My daughter took Kyle with her to meet up with some friends from the group last night. She said he was very depressed the whole time. In the car, he told me how horrible his month had been. Everything seemed hopeless to him. 

I don't even know what to do. I lost my other brother (my only real sibling) to suicide twenty years ago. I'm so, so very scared that I'll lose my nephew, too. As much as I want to yell and scream at my brother to do the right thing, I know he could just easily ban Kyle from coming over to our house, as he has in the past. I'm crying right now over the whole situation.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone. I&amp;#39;m not sure if I&amp;#39;m posting in the right place, but here it goes.
