Here's the deal: I'm 22 years old, and I'm not overweight, but I lean towards the heavier side of average--I'm 5'11"", 165 lbs, with a nice layer of belly fat I could do without, and thighs with a bit of jiggle to them. I feel like my body is underwhelming--not something that would turn too many people off, but also not something I'm excited to show anyone. 

I've decided I'm going to start lifting weights, for a couple of reasons--what little weight lifting I've done has been fun, I'd like to be able to supplement doing martial arts (which is how I keep in shape now) with something more straightforward, I can use some more strength, and, pretty significantly, I'd like to see how my body changes.

So here's my question--how do you guys feel about someone who's in decent shape, and has the body of someone who lifts weights and is fairly active, but also has some extra body fat in visible places? What does it take to push someone from ""not unattractive"" into ""attractive""?

(Note: Your answers probably aren't going to influence my exercise choices; I'm just curious about how other people feel. It's kind of hard for me to even tell for myself, since most of the men whose bodies I'm used to seeing are movie stars, TV stars, athletes, and porn stars, which can skew one's perspective.)

UPDATE: Alrighty, since some of you have been asking what I look like [this is me here](http://imgur.com/RH02OUs). Now I hope I'm not coming across as vain, or superficial. I understand that what people find attractive varies from person to person, and I agree that a lot of it has to do with more than body type.

I'm not sure what I'm looking for, maybe just someone to listen. Please, if your advice is to tell me to stop being a pussy, then don't bother commenting. Constructive and serious input is very much appreciated.

I think there's something missing in my life. It's a nagging feeling that sometimes drags me down with it. It's sort of like restlessness, boredom, loneliness and frustration combined. But why??

I don't know if it's depression, a mental disorder, or maybe I really am missing something. I have an employer that treats me right. I have a boyfriend of three and a half years who loves me very much. I have a family who also loves me very much. I have friends that I appreciate me and who I also very much appreciate. I treat myself well physically, I get regular exercise, leave the apartment often and I make sure I eat healthy most of the time. I don't really neglect myself that I know of.

But it feels like I'm very much operating like a robot. Just doing the same things over and over again with no real end in sight. I wouldn't say I dread each day. It's more like I'm exasperated and tired and frustrated with everything. **I feel trapped**. I have goals and I work towards them, but I'm not passionate about them. I'm very indifferent. I love my boyfriend very much and I care about him a lot, but at the same time I'm also lately feeling indifferent towards him, both mentally and physically, maybe even bored. But that comes and goes like it always has. We haven't really had sex in a while either. I love going out and spending time with friends, but that's all it is. There are no deep and meaningful connections. No real progress. Just empty utterances of  ""I love your face"" and ""what are you doing this weekend?"". Even my best friend from college doesn't feel like a best friend any more. I see him like once or twice a month now. My hobbies and interests are still my hobbies and interests. But nothing ignites a burning passion in me anymore. It's just sort of... there. It just exists, that's it. As far as my job goes, I've been working on the same project for months. It's nowhere near done and that's expected. But it's no longer challenging or interesting to me. My employer treats me very, very well. But the boredom and disinterest there is also very real. 

So I guess I'm asking you guys what you think. It's like my passion for things and my wonder for the world is gone. I'm only 26. I do have a history of depression, but it was always more extreme. So if this is actually depression, then it's never been this ""light"" before. I've kept it under wrap for several years now. I stopped taking medication for it when I was 22.

So is this depression? Or what is it? Is this the life I have to endure until I die?

I see a future with this guy and he makes me really happy and there's never a dull moment with us. 

We said we'd do long distance and he'd visit once in a while but I don't think Im strong enough to be able to stay. The distance hurts. 

it feels hard going from cuddles hugs kissing etc to just Skype videos.  We lived 5 minutes away from each other now it's 24 hours.  I can't get rid of the constant heartache knowing we would hand out almost every day and now it's onot once or twice a year. it's only been a week since he left and I still feel lonely and empty.

What I want to know is how do you stay happy in a long distance relationship? How do you make it work?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m currently dating a guy in another province (24 hour drive), been dating a bit under a year.
