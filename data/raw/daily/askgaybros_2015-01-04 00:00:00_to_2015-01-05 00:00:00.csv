I'm a 22 year old dude from Belgium and this is the first time posting something on reddit so bear with me :X.

Let me start from the beginning so you'd have an idea what i'm talking about: It all started about 2.5 - 3 years ago at my first year of college. Here I met a guy who turned out to be my best friend / bro. He introduced me to his friends and 3 years later we kinda do everything together. They all know i'm gay and they all accept me for who I am. Since my family doesn't know about me ( they're really religious ), I consider them my family and they know I'd do anything for them and vica versa. I'm kinda the mommy of the group... Always worrying about them and I just want the best for them, since they really changed my life.

From the moment I met them, one guy of the group always stood out. But i've never thought it through because ... Well I dunno we're really close friends. And I would never do something that might result into losing him ( or any of them ). I always think before I act.

Now recently, don't ask me why... Those old ( well they've always been here )  feelings have been comming out again. And it scares the shit out of me. I have a very strong feeling he's in the closet. The cliché straight closet guy kinda type. It's either that or he's just extremely shy if it comes down to girls. I'm not going to ask him about it because if he is in the closet, he will come out when he feel comfortable enough to do so.

I know this is yet another ""Im in love with a best friend"" kind of thing but I really have no idea what to do about it.

Thanks.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi! I&amp;#39;m a 22 year old dude from Belgium and this is the first time posting something on reddit so bear with me :X.&lt;/p&gt;

However, my experiences so far have not been pleasant. I'm not looking for a relationship, yet it seems everyone else is hellbent on getting one and it feels like no one's there to actually be friends. For one, there is a mass divide between the gays and lesbians, for some reason, it's like they don't even interact which sort of makes it more apparent. 

I've been there for a 1.5 years now and every time I try to make friends with someone they end up asking me out after, and apparently me not wanting a relationship (or being my type) is not a good enough excuse to let them down? They take it personally which leads to awkwardness when they won't acknowledge me in the next meet up. It's hitting the point where I've ran out of guys to interact with just because I don't want to date them.

Each time there's a social where drinks and gay-clubs are involved these same people then surround me and basically try and get me paralytic, I end up going off with other people I meet there just because I get so uncomfortable and the next day I just get labelled a tease or a grindr slut.

I try my best to be nice and social to everyone, especially those that I wouldn't necessarily find in my normal social environments, but I'm now finding it increasingly harder to bring myself to go.

I recently entered a relationship [that is ~3 months old now] with an old hookup that grew into a mate. Always viewed him as a good mate, enjoying his company both in and out of the bedroom, but never really thought of it beyond that. Cue moment where subtle clues suddenly click, and he says we should make a go of a relationship. At the time, I wasn't sure, as I had pretty much never entertained the idea of him as a boyfriend; but decided to give it a go anyway because I don't often take chances, and we're similar in too many ways to ignore. We even pitch the same joke at the same time.

It's really hard for me to explain what i'm asking. Every time I look at him, I see a mate. I don't get a flip of my stomach, I don't get excited like my food is coming, I just think ""oh hey ~~friend~~ ~~mate~~ oh right bae"", and I wonder if this will ever change, or I've made a grievous error.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Howdy bros, I need some advice.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm straight, and my best friend of 12 years came out about a year ago.

I tried to be supportive as possible and stuff, and he feels really comfortable with his sexuality now, but when my brother came out a month ago, they started spending lots of time together.

I love them both and I want them to be happy but since they started dating I can't help but feel a little weird. Are my feelings justified? 

Also, I feel like I'm being replaced. Me and my brother are identical, and my bestie has been spending more and more time with him and less and less time with me. I miss my friend.

idk this post really isn't very good I just wanted to get my thoughts out and get some advice from you guys because you all seem lovely :)

I guess, overall, why do I matter anymore? my brother gives him everything I do, PLUS sex (I assume) and a romantic relationship. 

Should I sorta just make some distance and get closer with other friends? idk I just feel redundant now.


advice and whatnot is very much welcome

So in November I started talking to this guy I met through Tumblr. He's 19, which I know that means us doing anything would be illegal but he lives far from me and I wouldn't do that. He just seemed chill so we starting talking. He identifies as bisexual too.

Right off the bat he tells me how attractive I am, etc. He's pretty cute and I was really flattered. A bunch of other guys, including girls tell me that I'm really hot, cute, sexy, but with my low self esteem I don't really consider myself attractive. 

A few days go by and we just talk normally. He slowly starts flirting with me, putting winky faces, heart eye emoji, ya know, making some jokes, and I went along with it. Now, I have only had relationships with girls. The thing is that I think guys are hot but I don't ever see myself being in a relationship with them. I guess I just am attracted to them in a sexual way, but I'm not sure.

These past few weeks we've been flirting alot and one time we had a ""dirty"" convo which I have only had with girls. But recently he's been saying these very romantic things like ""I wish I could cuddle with you"" &amp; ""I wanna kiss you &amp; watch movies together and fall asleep"". When he says this I just feel sort of uncomfortable and sort of disgusted by it, and I don't want him to continue saying all these things.

I realize I sort of did lead him on, but I wasn't trying to. I just wasn't sure what I felt, but now I know I don't want to be talking to this guy like we are dating, which is basically how he acts.

I have a problem (well a problem to others usually, not a problem to me). When I'm getting hot and heavy with another guy, I get so turned on that my entire body becomes a g-spot, which means that wherever I get touched, I get even closer to cumming. The reason this is a problem is because I can't last more than a minute if a guy starts sucking me off or if I start topping. I want to last longer so I can elongate the experience and the other guy can enjoy himself too, but I can't come up with any ideas how to hold off my orgasm without getting soft.

After over a month, its more difficult than I expected and I have a few questions that I hope people in this sub might have the experience to answer.

How do I get from my current max 5.75x1"" to my target 7x2""? (The larger size would help ensure I could handle whatever my partner might be packing.)

How do I condition myself to easily take the thrusting? I find I can go 5-10min with gentle thrusting but that friction and fatigue become an issue despite using generous lube (both high and low viscosity water based).

To answer questions you might have:

Why am I now interested in sex with men? 

Not for lack of periodic attempts, the only sex I've had with men was giving a curious friend head for a few minutes decades ago back in college before he suddenly backed away. A few years ago at a masturbation party I really enjoyed jacking a guy off. I still want to find the right guy and bottom for him at least once. I enjoy anal play, loved sucking cock, and now desire the real thing.

What do I do for warmup?

After a shower to clean up and make sure my rectum is clear, I usually massage externally and internally for 30min with a nitrile gloved lubed hand, followed by a wand before inserting the dildo. I always add more lube if I sense any friction and stop if I feel any pain at all. I have also increased the fibre, fruits, vegetables in my diet as well as my water intake. 

How did I end up doing all this anal play?

I got the dildos years ago for periodic self play and my wife eventually pegged me (which was very pleasurable). I am currently doing it for medical reasons (pelvic floor conditioning). But I've been enjoying it so much, that I really want to experience the real thing. I was once able to ease the big one in without too much effort, but reaching that point this time seems more difficult than it should be. 

If you desire sex with men, why don't you call yourself gay or bi?

Given that I have nearly no sexual experience with men and years of satisfying experiences with women, I'm certain that I'm not gay. I don't feel I quite qualify as bi either. I can be intensely physically attracted to particular men. I am not generally attracted to men. I am far less selective in my attraction to women. I think there might be a guy out there who would top me without fretting over my orientation. Maybe later in life I might identify as Bi.

They are worst around my armpits, especially on the backside of the pits and undersides of my biceps. Lots of little silver lines and sort of wrinkly looking. Theres a few that stretch an inch or two from my pits onto my pecs but those are more normal ive noticed, especially guys who lift. also little faint ones all over my biceps that stretch just short of my elbows, hidden by shirt sleeves luckily. But they're also on my stomach and stretch up around either side of my bellybutton, there are some that wrap around the sides of my waist( vertically), and then a few on either side of my crotch. Theyre all faded as much as they ever will be, under incandescent lighting they dont look too bad(a little lighter than skin color), under bluer fluorescent lighting they pop out like crazy and look so terrible(white), in the sun theyre just skin colored with a silver sheen.

I know this topic has been posted before, but I'm a nervous wreck right now and would love your feedback. 

Me and my bf have been dating for 5yrs, currently living together coming up on 2yrs. Mostly happily, I might add, with our fair share of relationship ups n downs. We have a trusting relationship, and I've never been suspicious of his actions until a few days ago. 

We did a New Years boys trip to Vegas (me, him, and another close guy friend who works with him, (he is dating a girl)). We had a blast and just got back on New Years day. At the airport leaving, I spotted my bf sitting apart from us so I came rushing up to him from behind, and when I was close enough, I'm 95% sure I spotted the orange 'Grindr' screen on his Ipod touch before he quickly put the screen face down and into his pocket. 

This is extremely unusual for him, as he's a low-key guy, we are both in a sexual monogamous relationship, and neither of us use gay dating apps/websites. This bothered me but I tried to forget about it, until he started acting more strange last night... 

I made us dinner, and immediately afterward he goes into his room. I usually just come in to hangout and browse reddit/facebook or something but he tells me: 'We just spent a week together, can I have some alone time?'. I can respect personal time, but he spent at least 4hrs in his room alone and didn't make much noise, which again is very unlike him. Even moreso what comes next..

It's now 1:30am and I'm tired of watching Buzzfeed videos and browsing reddit reading other r/askgaybros posts when My bf comes out of his room saying ""I'm going to run to my store to get some Pepto, I'm not feeling well"" (he owns a grocery store 10mins away from our condo). 

I cock one eyebrow and say ""ok, see you soon, I'm getting ready for bed"". So 35mins pass and he's still not back. The drive to his store roundtrip takes 25mins tops. I'm anxiously pacing the dark living room awaiting his truck headlights to come into view down the road, but nothing. 

So 45 mins later &amp; thinking the worst, I start to sob thinking he might have just cheated on me as I'm crawling into bed alone. I shoot him a text asking ""what's taking so long"", and he responds with ""couldn't find 24hr pharmacy, went to gas station"". ""I'm back now, but I'm feeling super warm, so I'm sitting in my truck with the window down"". (FYI - it was -29C last night here).

Finally 50min later he comes through the door and I ask if he's feeling ok. (since it's not like him to go out at 1:30am, in -29C weather). He responds ""yes"", and proceeds to ask me if I'm ""ok"". We have a small conversation about the evening, me asking him why he wanted all night to himself, him asking me if there's something wrong. 

It took all my willpower to not ask ""are you cheating on me"" or ""are you using Grindr?"". But I just asked him to tuck me in bed and hug me goodnight. This morning he awoke me, we got up and had a shower together and he got ready for work, normal stuff.

But, I've been taking note of him using his iPod touch, and he hasn't left it out of his sight. He took the ipod ""to the store"" lastnight, and I noticed he slipped it in his pocket to take to work today. He NEVER BRINGS his iPod with him to work or out on errands. I suspect he is slinging network from his Blackberry to use the iPod. 

I'm assuming the worst, but I know he might be using it for self-validation, networking, I dunno. Either way - I'm  suspicious and he is hiding something from me, I just don't know how to approach this..

I guess I've taken it too far. In my own bid to become that person, I've taken poisons to help me (I won't mention it, but something that causes rapid weightloss and has killed). I still feel ugly, because I'm now too thin, but I'm not fat anymore.

So a couple days ago I met this guy (we will call John) through mutual friends. Right off the bat I noticed he was very nice, outgoing, and cute. He was very friendly toward me and I noticed that while we all hung out watching TV...we had longer than usual eye contact (we were locked and dialed into each other). Instantly, I started crushing on him which I rarely do with anyone...and usually it's on guys who are gay/bi.

Now, his friends said they don't know if he isn't straight. He has never had a gf, he ""looks"" gay (as an aside I swear a lot of gays have similar facial features but maybe that's just me), and had the red human rights equality profile pic on facebook a year ago, yet FB says he's only interested in women. Even in the group of our friends, he hung out nearly exclusively with me through the night even though we just met.  I could go on, but the gaydar is pinging pretty high on him.

Now, even though my gaydar is pretty good, I know you all will say **YOU JUST NEED TO ASK**. Our mutual friend had no idea but was curious about John's preference(s), so I now ask you folks how I should figure it out. Should I casually drop that I once dated a dude from his prep school, flat out ask him, etc? I don't want to weird him out if he is straight as he would still be an awesome friend. We are hanging out again tonight and may just be grabbing dinner ourselves so I need help fast. Thanks!

Okay, sooo I went to a party last night with some friends. We drank loads and smoked a bit too and am only now beginning to function :| It was great and relaxing. Everyone bailed out early, leaving myself and the guy hosting the party alone on the couch. Not sure how we topic of conversation came to sexuality but he was telling me how confused he was and isn't sure if he is gay or straight. We've known each other for a good while (2-3 years) and he knows I'm openly gay. Anyway he says that he finds me attractive, and next thing i know we are kissing. I stop kissing him, ask him how that felt or how he felt. He says it felt good and he's glad we kissed. We continue to talk and he says that he's too fucked to do anything more or fool around with me and that he is sorry. We continue to just chill on the couch talking, and my hand moves a little more south, below the belt and into his jeans. I grabbed his cock and during all of this he doesn't stop me and just smiles. However, he does say ""that doesn't do anything for me"" - and he doesn't get hard.  More talking ensues around sexuality (he keeps bringing it up) and saying that he was told from a young age that homosexuality is wrong, his parents told him it wasn't right, but he doesn't think know what he should believe as he thinks it's okay.. maybe?. He fears doing anything with another guy is wrong and thinks people would judge him for it, including his parents. I think this is where is confusion stems - in that he is conflicted with what society says, his family beliefs and his own. Can't really remember too much after this as my memory is a little hazy (haha no pun intended), but I am pretty sure we kissed again. I think I even offered him a BJ and he said 'no' cause he is too fucked to get it up or something like that, he again apologizes. We ended up just falling asleep on the couch and we woke up couple hours later. I said goodbye, thanks for the party and jumped on the bus to head home. 

I guess, I don't know what to do now. Do I just ignore it or do I say something? I am of course not sure what I want from this situation. I don't think I'd want more from it or a relationship. That would certainly make things weird. But, I certainly would not be opposed to some fooling around, casual hookups and FWB type deal. But of course, that may be difficult if he is looking for more? It seems like he is in a really confused place and the combination of alcohol and weed definitely relaxed him enough to want to talk about these things.

It's now been 3 days and not a word.

I've been dating a man for 8 days. (Let's call him K) He is like the guy I've been looking for ages. He is bearded, polite, respectful and lovely and loves kissing a lot !

We are both tops. (Well, he is ""topper"" than me.) So we haven't fucked yet. Mostly kissing, rubbing, licking, sucking. 

Three days ago we were making love in bed at like 10 a.m and we were naked. His upper-legs caught my attention. There were little purple scars/wounds. After that I observed his body cautiously. Not everywhere but in his upper-arms, feet, lower-legs; he has that before-mentioned purple scars/wounds. (But a lot lighter color compared to the ones on his upper-legs) Sometimes he itches them really really hard. And his under-eyes are darker compared to his normal skin color. 
After this realization, the thought of his being sick was preying on my mind. So I could not wait and told him these:

""You know K, I love you very much. You are very important for me. Now, I'm gonna tell you something. Before telling it, I want to you know that we are mature enough to talk about this kind of stuff. Also, as a person who has a relationship with you, both physically and sensationally, I think I have the right to know the truths about your health.
Do you use any drugs ? Have you had unprotected sex before me ? What about those scars ? Why do you have them ? ""

After telling this him, he answered all my questions maturely and told me that he should have tell me about those scars earlier. He said because he studies agriculture engineering, while on his training course he developed some allergic thing to certain herbs. This is the cause of those scars. Also he said ""When I get stressed/angry I itch a lot."" He obviously felt my concern and said ""Don't worry, I am not AIDS or something"" laughingly. 

This was a relief for me but still... I don't trust him completely on this subject because he loves me and I said him earlier that if he lies me about this kind of stuff I'll end my relationship immediately. 

He cummed my mouth several times and we kiss a lot. (A little biting too.) I'll have a HIV Combo Test two weeks later. But until that time, I don't know what to do/think. My exams are about the start and my mind is busy with my and his health. Help me please !

When he was around 11 for some reason his mother looked at his browsing history and found a lot of links to gay porn, she called me in the room and we both didn't know what to do, so we called him in and confronted him as such. I could tell he was absolutely mortified trying to tell us his friends sent him the links etc, but there was a lot of it. I thought it would be best to say meet us in the living room and we can discuss it, but he never came, so I thought it best if we just forgot it even happened.

Years later we've never seen him date or have a relationship with a girl so it feels quite obvious to us, but he's never come out to us or made it known to us that he's been dating any boys either. I feel these are his formative years and when I was his age it was when I made mistakes in relationships that come with the experience and I feel he's missing out on this - in the end I do just want the best for him.

We've had some hiccups in terms of our relationship recently because I've been trying to get him to go to University as at the moment he's doing male modelling of all things... which he's successful at currently but in my eye's it's not a sustainable career, which at his age he doesn't seem to understand. This strain is obviously pulling us further apart and i'm worried that it's pushing him away and he will never be himself with us and I really don't know what to do.

Do I just ask him to his face? Or will it bring back the experience of when it basically happened last time?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello, I&amp;#39;m looking for advice about my son, he&amp;#39;s 20 now and for a very long time me and his mother had the evidence about his sexuality.
