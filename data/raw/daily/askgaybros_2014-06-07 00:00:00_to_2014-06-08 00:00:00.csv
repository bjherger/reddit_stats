So, as a 20 (almost 21 year old) I'd love to get properly into shape (build me a good chest, biceps, legs, etc.). Problem is, I'm kinda strapped for cash so a gym membership is out of the question :(. I do have the following at home;

- set of adjustable (spin-lock) dumbbells
- 4 x 5kg weight plates
- 4 x 2.5kg weight plates 
- 4 x 1.25kg weight plates 
- weighted jump rope
- bike

Right now I suppose I'm what you'd consider average build at 1.83m (6 foot) and just under 80kgs (175 pounds) (can post pics if it makes it easier to asses). I already do a 5-7km run every day so that's kinda my cardio. 

What I'm looking for is a good starting exercise plan and nutrition advice to start building me a better body *that I can do at home*. I'm not really concerned about losing weight but if it makes it easier in the long run, I'm all for it. 

Any help would be much appreciated guys.

Like a month or two ago I met this stunning hot guy who just got hired at my job. We exchanged nods and simple hellos for sometime, I'm an introvert and not the best icebreaker. But well, a few weeks later I find him in the restroom. I was washing my hands and he approaches me says hello and mentions that he's looking for friends. It struck me as the oddest thing ever because of the simple setting. A restroom. I felt like I was being hit on. I got a little wide eyed and well we exchanged numbers.

I didn't see him anymore that day. After I got off work I text him, we talk a bit, small talk and I just went ahead and asked him ""Are you gay?"" He says no and he tells me he has a girlfriend, that he's only looking for friends at work. The friendship deepens, he feels comfortable enough to tell me that he is curious, we begin trading pictures. Nudes. He acts like it's nothing. Little by little he reveals certain things about him. I tell him how I feel. I'm starting to feel a crush coming on because he genuinely felt like a very nice guy.

He's not freaked out, takes it in stride and doesn't mind. It felt off but I went with it... Earlier this week we were having our typical conversation about work and our coworkers and he confesses to me that he isn't curious but actually bisexual, and that he has had sex with at least one guy. I'm like ""Oh OK"" I pause for a bit ""Uh. Why didn't you tell me earlier?"" He said something about trusting a person. Obviously he isn't out to anyone.. He sends me more revealing pictures. I'm really into him, I start playing around and start calling him hun and babe. We've planned on getting together and ""experimenting"" which became actual ""fooling around"" later, but well no place to do it and stuff got in the way.

I don't know what happened. Two days later I text him Good Morning, he was at work (I went in later that day) He said nothing back but sent me a picture of some guy in his department ""He's cute"". I was like OK, wtf? (Remember I'm crushing on him and he knows) He goes on and on ""He has a cute butt omg"" ""I'm imagining myself with him"".. I told him to shut up, that it wasn't funny. I started feeling hurt. I saw him at work but I just said hi, had some small talk, caught him looking the guys way and I told him to stop. He's like smirking and said ""I'm not!"" Well I kept calm and said i'll catch him later.

Texted him to come see me in my area. He didn't show. I texted him and he started getting sluggish at replying and returning calls. Well he answer and he says he's always had a crush on him since he started working there. He kept talking about the guy a bit later and ignoring my other questions.

I start freaking out. I know he isn't my boyfriend, and I know he's just a crush. But I totally had a flip out, a jealousy fit. I wouldn't mind if he liked a guy because we have eyes for a reason, and we appreciate good looks when we see them. But the way he was talking about him enraged me, like nothing before. I started calling him nonstop, he wouldn't pick up, messaging him, facebooking him. Nothing. He wouldn't show signs of life. Until he's like ""Bro, calm down. I can't like a guy. Are you serious?? We're not a couple!"" I told him I knew that. But I felt destroyed by how he talked about him... He blocked my number and deleted me off Facebook. I blocked him there before he could. 

Is this worth saving? Is this even savable after what I did? What would you do in this situation? Mind you I felt he did show interest in me, but it seems like he's more interested in that guy. I see him at work tomorrow.. Should I even approach him, apologize in person?

**TL;DR**
New hire at work, straight, tells me he's curious, then that he's bi. Reveals flaming crush on a co-worker. I have a jealousy fit, he stops talking to me.

This just lead to so much anti-socialism in high school, I didn't make too many friends nor did I get out much or ever dated, actually. I had crushed on girls, but my shyness and uncertainty kept me from doing much. I also kind of knew I was gay so I didn't want to lead anyone on. I eventually got some confidence and got comfortable with the idea of being gay but a little late as I got to community college.

So, I came out around March. Off the bat I found a guy I was interested in and eventually started dating and well we've been together for about ten months. As I dated him, I felt more confident and had much more energy to socialize and just be comfortable and unafraid of people knowing.

However, as I talk to him more and find more about his life, I feel a little jealous. Not to say that after hearing about it I longed for what he did, but before coming out I longed for a good social life. He did track and tennis, lead clubs like GSA, was very social, and came out. He realized he was gay, got a boyfriend broke up, was asked out by guys. He pretty much did not skip out on anything. Not to mention he was pretty fit and overall attractive, I was still developing I guess through high school I guess.

I usually just stayed home during the weekends, but hung out with a couple friends every now in then if they remembered to invite me. I was part of a couple clubs, but didn't get too close to people or made many friends. I tried out for tennis for three years, but didn't make it at all. I usually felt like I was wasn't deserving of making good friends with people since I thought I wasn't entitled to be part of their circle in a way. It's a terrible feeling, but I didn't do much.

Also, I didn't have the confidence (I also didn't look as good, lol) to make many friends or be open about anything I also didn't really flirt much if at all or go through many experiences. I didn't make too many friends either. Lately me and my bf are too busy to hang out much. I feel like maybe the time to mess around and have fun has passed. I don't feel like I got it out of my system and all that. I love him, but I wish I had experiences from the past like making a lot of friends or maybe dated a girl then a guy and just maid a lot of friends and had fun overall.

I'm 20 now, with a boyfriend and a couple more friends, but I can't say I'm invited anywhere often or hang out much besides with my boyfriend and his friends. Making a lot of friends at community college is somewhat hard, and rare but eh. I just wish I had a better background to feel better.

Kinda had a 'erm' feeling but go with the flow, he messaged me so why not reply?  We chatted, he seemed nice, he wanted to meet.  I texted him the night before to check it was still on, to be honest I half hoped he'd shit out because he was just too young and I thought I'd be wasting my time (also it was a 2.5hr drive...) but it's on.  I figured we'd meet, either my age for him or his maturity level for me would make it a straight no.

We meet, plan was for coffee and we're in a city neither of us knows well.  We walk and chat and I spot a cafe sign at an art gallery so we go there.  He wants to go round the gallery and we do, discussing the art and chatting abut our lives.  We later wander the city, take in a movie, have dinner and end up spending seven hours together.  

I've had quite a few dates and some short term flings lately but this one couldn't have been better if I'd planned it.  He's hot, educated, reasonably well travelled for his age (which is my thing), independent (he's living here as a foreign student and paying his own way).  He's also not exactly rolling in it as a student though, so I'm paying, which is where the 'erm' feeling comes in - not sure I wanna be a sugar daddy.  He seems keen though, we're going clubbing tomorrow night as date two.  Kicker - he's 20 and I'm late 30s...  

Normally I wouldn't go there.  But last guy that I saw that wanted to go round an art gallery?  Never.  Like I said I've had a few things with guys in the last four months or so since I broke up with the last guy (who was about 10 years younger than me, so go my type...) and I genuinely haven't felt a connection like this with anybody I've met recently.  I don't wanna get screwed over but I'm big and bad enough to deal with that myself.  But the age thing...  It does feel a bit creepy.  That said a good (str8) mate has told me ""If it works go for it"", so...  Any thoughts bros?

I figured we&amp;#39;d meet, either my age for him or his maturity level for me would make it a straight no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We meet, plan was for coffee and we&amp;#39;re in a city neither of us knows well.  We walk and chat and I spot a cafe sign at an art gallery so we go there.  He wants to go round the gallery and we do, discussing the art and chatting abut our lives.  We later wander the city, take in a movie, have dinner and end up spending seven hours together.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had quite a few dates and some short term flings lately but this one couldn&amp;#39;t have been better if I&amp;#39;d planned it.  He&amp;#39;s hot, educated, reasonably well travelled for his age (which is my thing), independent (he&amp;#39;s living here as a foreign student and paying his own way).  He&amp;#39;s also not exactly rolling in it as a student though, so I&amp;#39;m paying, which is where the &amp;#39;erm&amp;#39; feeling comes in - not sure I wanna be a sugar daddy.  He seems keen though, we&amp;#39;re going clubbing tomorrow night as date two.  Kicker - he&amp;#39;s 20 and I&amp;#39;m late 30s...  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally I wouldn&amp;#39;t go there.  But last guy that I saw that wanted to go round an art gallery?  Never.  Like I said I&amp;#39;ve had a few things with guys in the last four months or so since I broke up with the last guy (who was about 10 years younger than me, so go my type...) and I genuinely haven&amp;#39;t felt a connection like this with anybody I&amp;#39;ve met recently.  I don&amp;#39;t wanna get screwed over but I&amp;#39;m big and bad enough to deal with that myself.  But the age thing...  It does feel a bit creepy.  That said a good (str8) mate has told me &amp;quot;If it works go for it&amp;quot;, so...  Any thoughts bros?&lt;/p&gt;

I live in a specific region of the U.S., I have a specific personality. I don't speak on behalf of all white gaybros nor do I speak *about* all black gaybros.

I also have no idea how this will be received, and I have never voiced these thoughts before, which is why I created a throwaway.

So anyway, here goes: When race issues come up in the gay community, we pretty much hear one of two things: 1) our culture values whiteness, which causes white people (and even some minorities) to chase white people and 2) the dick wants what it wants, and there's no changing that.

I have been propositioned by many black guys on Grindr, and while a couple of them became real flirtationships, I ended up denying every black guy in the end. (Note: my profile does *not* say ""whites only"", nor have I ever consciously considered that as my dating/hook-up policy).

With the exception of all but one black guy, the same few thoughts led me to deny them in the end.

1) Where I live, almost every single black guy is in the ""inner city"". 

This is not an automatic reason for rejection, especially since I lived in the inner city myself for a few months so I know it's not a *total* warzone like everyone in the 'burbs always says (although my apartment complex was surrounded by barbed wire, so you can't deny that it looks like one).

*However*, there are some truths about the inner city that are undeniable. Crime is a bigger a threat. Homophobia is more serious. It adds another layer of risk to hooking up, which by itself is already pushing my limits of what I'm willing to gamble.

Because of all the risks involved in hooking up to begin with, one more straw is all it takes to break the camel's back, and this right here will do it.

2) Black churches around here hold high-profile anti-gay--err, excuse me, *""pro traditional marriage""*--meetings. While some white guys might still use ""gay"" to describe something that sucks, black guys around here take it a step further--they says something's ""straight"" when it's right or good. 

There are a lot of ""discrete"" white gay guys too, but almost every single black gay guy here is on the down low--*and there is a reason for that*.

Homophobia (and I mean *serious* homophobia, not just ""we think you should settle for civil unions"" homophobia) is simply harder to avoid in the black community than it is outside of it.

So that leads me to my point: *I don't know you, your friends, your neighbors, or your family*. I have no fucking clue what will happen if someone walks in on us while we're at your house or if a neighbor overhears us or *whatever*.

I also have a probably-irrational fear that someone on Grindr could be a homophobe trying to set up a trap. When it's a guy inviting me down to the hood for sex, that fear gets stoked to the nth degree.

I know that these are generalizations and/or stereotypes. But when dealing with meeting a stranger, these are the judgment calls I fall back on. Better safe than sorry.

3) I hate to mention this one, but I wouldn't be honest with all of you if I didn't.

Among MSM, black guys account for not just the largest percentage of HIV infections, but the largest *whole number*. This is despite black MSM only making up a small fraction of MSM as a whole.

AIDS is a big fear of mine. I am strict about safer sex. I treat everyone I have sex with as if they could be infected. But unless a black guy is recently tested and has the papers to show it, my mind won't be at ease about it.

Does that make me a terrible person and a racist? Maybe. I don't fucking know.

That pretty much sums up my mind set when it comes to getting with black guys. Of course, these hang ups can be overcome by things like: 1) meeting in a hotel or something instead of at home and 2) being tested and being able to show it. The black guys I've chatted with weren't really willing to make that much effort, though.

**TL;DR: Location, homophobic friends/family in the black community, and the fear of AIDS all contribute to me sticking with white guys around here. You can hate me for it, but I hope this prompts some more in-depth discussion of race than what we usually see in the gay community. Let me know what you think.**","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to say upfront that my experience and my opinions are just that: my own. I live in a specific region of the U.S., I have a specific personality. I don&amp;#39;t speak on behalf of all white gaybros nor do I speak &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; all black gaybros.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also have no idea how this will be received, and I have never voiced these thoughts before, which is why I created a throwaway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So anyway, here goes: When race issues come up in the gay community, we pretty much hear one of two things: 1) our culture values whiteness, which causes white people (and even some minorities) to chase white people and 2) the dick wants what it wants, and there&amp;#39;s no changing that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been propositioned by many black guys on Grindr, and while a couple of them became real flirtationships, I ended up denying every black guy in the end. (Note: my profile does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; say &amp;quot;whites only&amp;quot;, nor have I ever consciously considered that as my dating/hook-up policy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the exception of all but one black guy, the same few thoughts led me to deny them in the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Where I live, almost every single black guy is in the &amp;quot;inner city&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not an automatic reason for rejection, especially since I lived in the inner city myself for a few months so I know it&amp;#39;s not a &lt;em&gt;total&lt;/em&gt; warzone like everyone in the &amp;#39;burbs always says (although my apartment complex was surrounded by barbed wire, so you can&amp;#39;t deny that it looks like one).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;However&lt;/em&gt;, there are some truths about the inner city that are undeniable. Crime is a bigger a threat. Homophobia is more serious. It adds another layer of risk to hooking up, which by itself is already pushing my limits of what I&amp;#39;m willing to gamble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of all the risks involved in hooking up to begin with, one more straw is all it takes to break the camel&amp;#39;s back, and this right here will do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Black churches around here hold high-profile anti-gay--err, excuse me, &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;pro traditional marriage&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;--meetings. While some white guys might still use &amp;quot;gay&amp;quot; to describe something that sucks, black guys around here take it a step further--they says something&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;straight&amp;quot; when it&amp;#39;s right or good. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of &amp;quot;discrete&amp;quot; white gay guys too, but almost every single black gay guy here is on the down low--&lt;em&gt;and there is a reason for that&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Homophobia (and I mean &lt;em&gt;serious&lt;/em&gt; homophobia, not just &amp;quot;we think you should settle for civil unions&amp;quot; homophobia) is simply harder to avoid in the black community than it is outside of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that leads me to my point: &lt;em&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know you, your friends, your neighbors, or your family&lt;/em&gt;. I have no fucking clue what will happen if someone walks in on us while we&amp;#39;re at your house or if a neighbor overhears us or &lt;em&gt;whatever&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also have a probably-irrational fear that someone on Grindr could be a homophobe trying to set up a trap. When it&amp;#39;s a guy inviting me down to the hood for sex, that fear gets stoked to the nth degree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that these are generalizations and/or stereotypes. But when dealing with meeting a stranger, these are the judgment calls I fall back on. Better safe than sorry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) I hate to mention this one, but I wouldn&amp;#39;t be honest with all of you if I didn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among MSM, black guys account for not just the largest percentage of HIV infections, but the largest &lt;em&gt;whole number&lt;/em&gt;. This is despite black MSM only making up a small fraction of MSM as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AIDS is a big fear of mine. I am strict about safer sex. I treat everyone I have sex with as if they could be infected. But unless a black guy is recently tested and has the papers to show it, my mind won&amp;#39;t be at ease about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does that make me a terrible person and a racist? Maybe. I don&amp;#39;t fucking know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That pretty much sums up my mind set when it comes to getting with black guys. Of course, these hang ups can be overcome by things like: 1) meeting in a hotel or something instead of at home and 2) being tested and being able to show it. The black guys I&amp;#39;ve chatted with weren&amp;#39;t really willing to make that much effort, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR: Location, homophobic friends/family in the black community, and the fear of AIDS all contribute to me sticking with white guys around here. You can hate me for it, but I hope this prompts some more in-depth discussion of race than what we usually see in the gay community. Let me know what you think.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
