This week, I discovered my (straight, homophobic- but kind of insensitive) brother is on Grindr. I recognised his headless body (he has a third nipple, which is like a criminal having a scar over his eye).

I have also discovered that he sends very aggressively sexual messages to guys ""Come and suck me, etc"") and I'm struggling to get my head around what is happening. I'm feeling quite angry that I felt so alone when I was dealing with this, but he's out touching willy. Those kind of guys really put me off grindr- I had a sex-crazy phase at uni, but now I like the conversations with nice chaps.

I don't know if you realised this, but there's a big holiday happening right now which is forcing me to be in a room with him for ages.

Do I mention it to him? Am I homophobic now? I hope not because I love me some Luke Evans and I don't want to hate myself for that.

**EDIT: I've done some thinking and I've maybe come to a conclusion as to why it bothers me so much. I have a right-leaning family, politically and none of them are too great with homosexuality. I've worked hard to make sure I could one day maybe change their views on it- if they see me in a stable relationship, happy, successful, whatever- I can show them a world where gay people aren't out to ""destroy families"" or that love between two men is real, not ""just lusting"". Don't get me wrong, I'm not living my life to please them, I just hoped to show them that it isn't evil or dirty, or anything. My brother entering this world as a sex-crazed guy, only out to sleep with guys is like a punch to the gut of my thing. Like he's showing the world they actually fear. I know it sounds childish and I'm sorry for being so dickish about it. To add- I love my family and they're really nice people, but they're old-fashioned and stubborn about some things.**","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Was&amp;#39;happenin playas?&lt;/p&gt;

Normally I chat for a while, then if a conversation is going somewhere we see about pics etc.

Today I lost my filter, and ended up ""woofing"" random hot guys, sending lots of Grindr hello's, and sending them pics (which is something I'm usually very careful about considering the consequences of word getting out for me being very high). 

One guy I woofed and then forgot about from some distance away decided to message me. He was pretty hot and had a cute profile description, and when I sent him my pictures he laid on the compliments. I, being a complete idiot, thought he was serious and because i rarely ever get compliments got happy / excited / stupider. I ended up sending him more pics, pics which should really not be sent to anyone let alone a stranger I am talking to for the first time that night. He sends some pictures back, I am getting hopeful that even if this person is too far away, at least it means people like me have a chance with people like him. 

Then suddenly, everything disappears. Blocked, and with it he presumably took my pictures, which could be floating around who knows where. I just feel like a huge idiot, I should know the risks by now and be less impulsive and who knows when this could come back to bite me. He also wasn't the only one I messaged pics (though not as bad) and I am just regretting this whole day.

I guess my question is, are there any steps I should take to cover myself ? (the pics didn't show more than my lips along with my body - but that is still a lot, and there was a separate picture of just my face). 
And any advice in just handling myself better? I am tempted to delete all these apps, but then there is the worry that people who I have talked to / sent pictures to might do something + it is my only real connection to other gay people right now (however superficial it is). I should be smarter than this.

If I was in this situation, I'd be super thrifty, but his mindset is ""I won't actively spend money, but if someone asks me to do something, and it costs money, I won't say no."" He also spends a large chunh every monty on a gym membership.

There is a big vacation period for both of us coming up soon, and we were talking about it. I feel the need to travel somewhere (for my sanity), but it's unclear yet if he will be able to get the money together. 

We decided to wait a little bit before making any decisions about vacation, but I'm worried in the end he may not be able to travel. Then that leaves me with the decision of traveling alone, and leaving him behind (and feeling shitty), or hanging out at home together, both not working, and will most likely end up with me feeling resentful.

&lt;p&gt;There is a big vacation period for both of us coming up soon, and we were talking about it. I feel the need to travel somewhere (for my sanity), but it&amp;#39;s unclear yet if he will be able to get the money together. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided to wait a little bit before making any decisions about vacation, but I&amp;#39;m worried in the end he may not be able to travel. Then that leaves me with the decision of traveling alone, and leaving him behind (and feeling shitty), or hanging out at home together, both not working, and will most likely end up with me feeling resentful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this all just what a relationship is about? Anyone else have experience or advice about partners with different financial situations?&lt;/p&gt;

Home alone and stuck with sad-ish thoughts. I'm not really asking for help (though if anyone's got any bright ideas I'm all for hearing them), I'm mostly just seeing if actually expressing these thoughts might help get them off repeat. **TL;DR: A big rambling wall of text of me musing about my body, my dating prospects, and life in general follows. It's probably not going to come to a point. I'm fine, I just want to vent a little.**

So, I'm alone at Christmas because I have just my mom for family, and she lives kind of far away (in a horribly cold city), and at any rate she visited just a couple weeks ago, and I'm not the type to blow $400 on air fare just to distract myself for a few days. Also, she's got issues of her own, and as dearly as I love her it's not exactly super happy fun times when we're together. All my friends actually *have* big happy families (or a close enough approximation) and are super busy busy, so there's little relief there. Even most of my close online gaming buddies aren't logging on this week.

This happens pretty much every year. Normally I just try to get ahead on work during Christmas, but this year there's fuck-all to do, so I can't even use that to stay distracted...

I'm just sitting around feeling lonely and thinking how I wish I had a boyfriend (or really anyone I could be close to) to pass the time with. And that gets me thinking about dating, and how (poorly) that's been going. (I actually met a dude who's fucking perfect, who likes me, and who I'd go for in a heartbeat recently - except he's already in a relationship and isn't actually available.) And that leads to musing about things I wish I could change about myself vs the things I could change but honestly would rather not.

Basically, I'm a thin and vaguely nerdy dude (well, OK, I'm pretty fuckin' nerdy, I just don't really look the part). I'm told that I'm attractive, but I'm cursed with being disproportionately attracted towards fit, classically attractive men - the sort that haven't got two minutes for a dude like me (I mean that in a romantic context, it's not like they're stuck-up and literally won't talk to me or anything). And that's fine. It takes a lot of work to stay fit, so even without the superficial elements of attraction we'd still clearly have *huge* differences in the way we approach life and in our priorities. A little disappointing, but that's just how life goes.

As far as dudes who are (I guess?) more in my league go, it's just a constant stream of guys who don't know what they want (sure, fine, they're fun for a few dates) seasoned with an altogether unreal number of dramatic, shallow, vain, and mean little fuckers who act like they hated me before they even said ""hello"" (so why the fuck do they even say hello?!).

So I dunno what to do. Every now and then I start working out to try to improve my looks to get some attention from the unattainable dudes who keep catching my interest, but it never really works. I've got one of those genetically-thin bodies that resists gaining weight of any kind no matter what I do. It's always a huge struggle to get even the smallest of results (even forcing down the right amount of calories and protein is a chore), and the moment stress or anything like that hits I lose my appetite, I fumble my routine, and my gains evaporate.

And the worst part is that I just hate the process. I get no pleasure from running or lifting weights, so it's just time away from things I *would* enjoy. And at any rate I'm happy with my body - it does everything I need, it's comfortable to live in, and *I* think I look good. So not only is working out extremely tedious, it's also a bit (ok, a lot) depressing because I'm pouring all this effort into *maybe* making *other* people that I haven't even met yet happy. (So you can see why working out's the first thing to get dropped when life gets a little shitty.)

On the other hand, this body's pretty much consigned me to be lonely all the time. And it's not like I'm not happy - I generally am - I'm just also lonely, which is getting a bit old, y'know? Like it's been years since I got attention from anyone that *I* actually want back, so, shit...

And so finally, we get to the few dudes I've met who have amazing personalities, who've shown interest in me, and who I *would* love to have as boyfriends *if only I could find the slightest shred of physical attraction for them*. The ones who've become *just friends*, even though I know they'd be willing to try for more if I were similarly inclined. So there it is: I'm ultimately just as picky and shallow as the next guy.

I mean I just can't stop fucking myself over here, can I?

I'm attracted to dudes I can't have. I can't bring myself to change my body in order to fix that. And the dudes I *could* have, I tend to not want. It's almost Christmas eve, and I'm alone in my little three-sided box of solitude, venting here online and casually wondering if the French have a word for how I'm feeling.

Thanks to anyone who's read this far, and Merry Christmas.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey Bros,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as dudes who are (I guess?) more in my league go, it&amp;#39;s just a constant stream of guys who don&amp;#39;t know what they want (sure, fine, they&amp;#39;re fun for a few dates) seasoned with an altogether unreal number of dramatic, shallow, vain, and mean little fuckers who act like they hated me before they even said &amp;quot;hello&amp;quot; (so why the fuck do they even say hello?!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I dunno what to do. Every now and then I start working out to try to improve my looks to get some attention from the unattainable dudes who keep catching my interest, but it never really works. I&amp;#39;ve got one of those genetically-thin bodies that resists gaining weight of any kind no matter what I do. It&amp;#39;s always a huge struggle to get even the smallest of results (even forcing down the right amount of calories and protein is a chore), and the moment stress or anything like that hits I lose my appetite, I fumble my routine, and my gains evaporate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the worst part is that I just hate the process. I get no pleasure from running or lifting weights, so it&amp;#39;s just time away from things I &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; enjoy. And at any rate I&amp;#39;m happy with my body - it does everything I need, it&amp;#39;s comfortable to live in, and &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; think I look good. So not only is working out extremely tedious, it&amp;#39;s also a bit (ok, a lot) depressing because I&amp;#39;m pouring all this effort into &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; making &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; people that I haven&amp;#39;t even met yet happy. (So you can see why working out&amp;#39;s the first thing to get dropped when life gets a little shitty.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, this body&amp;#39;s pretty much consigned me to be lonely all the time. And it&amp;#39;s not like I&amp;#39;m not happy - I generally am - I&amp;#39;m just also lonely, which is getting a bit old, y&amp;#39;know? Like it&amp;#39;s been years since I got attention from anyone that &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; actually want back, so, shit...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so finally, we get to the few dudes I&amp;#39;ve met who have amazing personalities, who&amp;#39;ve shown interest in me, and who I &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; love to have as boyfriends &lt;em&gt;if only I could find the slightest shred of physical attraction for them&lt;/em&gt;. The ones who&amp;#39;ve become &lt;em&gt;just friends&lt;/em&gt;, even though I know they&amp;#39;d be willing to try for more if I were similarly inclined. So there it is: I&amp;#39;m ultimately just as picky and shallow as the next guy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean I just can&amp;#39;t stop fucking myself over here, can I?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m attracted to dudes I can&amp;#39;t have. I can&amp;#39;t bring myself to change my body in order to fix that. And the dudes I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; have, I tend to not want. It&amp;#39;s almost Christmas eve, and I&amp;#39;m alone in my little three-sided box of solitude, venting here online and casually wondering if the French have a word for how I&amp;#39;m feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to anyone who&amp;#39;s read this far, and Merry Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

I know there is a motivation subreddit, but I'd rather ask my bros. 

Anyway, I've just been feeling super lazy. Like, to the point where it is sort of causing me problems. There are so many things I want to do, and I have the means to do them, but I just don't. I just play games or lay around instead. I want to go to the gym, and sometimes I do, but I can't keep it consistent. I just wish I had the gumption to get up and do the things I want to do, rather than just lazing about.

Does anyone have any advice on this? I see people who are successful, happy, or fit, and they all seem to be the type of people who just get up and do something. I used to be like that when I was younger, but I just can't get it back. What are some practical ways you guys motivate yourselves (and please, none of the ""imagine yourself achieving your goals and how happy you'll be."" Those don't really do much for me.)?

For all intents and purposes we will call this guy E. After a bit of talking it becomes clear that E and I are both more interested in sex than a LTR. At the time however I was in the process of moving and he lived with his parents. Being that we really didn't have a place to have sex we decided to start going on dates to get to know each other.


For the next few weeks we went on one date a week more or less. So after the most recent date E tells me that he is starting to have strong feelings for me, and I tell him I feel the same. Things dramatically change though, and for next few weeks after our last date E doesn't really respond to my texts, or gives one word responses. Figuring that he lost interest I move on. I wasn't too invested in this guy so I really thought nothing of it.


Right at the start of finals week I get a text from none other than E. He wants to hang out, and being that i'm studying I tell him to come over to my fraternity. He comes over, and since it was the first time we had a room to ourselves we do the nasty. After doing the deed we start talking about hookups, and he tells me that while hookups are fun, that I should try looking for romance. E then begins hinting that he wants more of an emotional relationship with, and tells me that we should continue going on dates.


Fast forward to now. We haven't talked in three weeks and I don't know how to proceed. I'm not emotionally invested in E at this point, and I think I should just move on. That being said, even though I have no emotional attachment to E, I would like to continue having sex with him.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So about two months ago I met a guy on grindr who goes to college with me.
