Yeah, waiting for that has historical been my preferred and most successful dating method. Everything seems a bit easier. Suddenly the perfect first date pops into my head, and soon after I'm asking him on it. 

But I haven't found that lately.  

Of course I've gone on plenty of dates with less immediate chemistry before in my 28 years, but I've never been one to fill up the social calendar with dates just because. I'm not out there putting a bunch of eggs in different baskets (I've only overlapped casually dating two guys once). It's just not my inclination. I don't feel bad if its been a few months and I haven't gone on a single date. 

Of course, I know from friends and a lot of your answers here that that method works for a lot of people. I'm guessing it might be more of a tactic of extroverts, and my instincts are more introverted but I can push past them if need to be. 

But is it worth it in the long run? Does it get tiring or do you more often than not find something that makes it seem worth it at least for the time? And what are the standards here? Just asking out any guy who you think might be at least a nice date and not overthinking it?

I’m 19, he is 30. I met him around one year ago at a LGBT career event and we immediately clicked. He is handsome, super smart, kind and caring. When I can fall asleep on his hairy chest, I’m the happiest guy in the world :3 We do a lot of fun stuff together. We play videogames, we bake cookies, we go watch soccer games, we go to the animal shelter to see kittens and much more. We do also many weekend trips. For my birthday, we flew to Barcelona because I’m a big fan of the soccer team.


However, I feel like I’m a sort of second life for him. We never do romantic stuff in public like holding hands or have a candle-light dinner. When he goes out with his friends or colleagues, he never invites me. I suspect that some doesn’t even know I exist. And he always make excuses: “we are going to a bar”, “you would be bored”, “you hate hiking”, “you should study”, etc…
At the beginning, this didn’t bother me too much, but now I feel very bad. I text him to know if he is enjoying the event/vacation and he answers only hours later. In the meanwhile, I imagine him having sex with his friends and I start crying. I also feel very lonely when he is away because I practically lost all my friends when I started this relationship. I know that they call me “fat slut” :(


The worst, however, happened two days ago. I was working on my homework at his house and someone rang at the door. He was one of his colleague and I hear that they are arguing over something. I decided to go to the living room and I said hi to the guy. My boyfriend quite immediately said something like “he is the son of a friend and needed a place for a while”, then looked at me and said “you should study. Otherwise your dad gets angry with me”. I didn’t know what to say and I simply went back to the study room.


After the guy left, I confronted him and asked why he said that. He said something about his colleague being a homophobe douche. But I kept asking why, so he looked angrily at me and yelled “Are you a total idiot or you just pretend? Why the fuck do you think I said that? Fucking little prick”. I started crying and he said “Do you actually have any skill besides crying and sucking cocks?” and left the house. He never raised his voice with me. I collected my stuff and went back to my dorm, where I have been since then. He sent me texts apologizing for his behavior and tried to call me, but I haven’t answered because I don’t know what to say.


I’m clearly an embarrassment for him, even if I don’t know why. Because I’m a bit feminine and not manly as his friends? Because I’m not American as his friends and colleagues? Because I’m a bit childish? Because I’m not smart and sophisticated?

Dunno what to do….


TL;DR I love my bf and we do a lot of stuff together, but never with his friends and in romantic settings. So, I'm jealous and lonely. Few days ago he told a colleague that I was the son of a friend, then he attacked me when I asked why he said that. I feel like I'm an embarrassment...

Edit:
Thanks everyone for the advice and sorry if I look so dumb. I don't think I can dump him. He is practically the only person that I still have in my life. I will try to talk with him and understand what is bothering him.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the long rant, but I need to vent&lt;/p&gt;

After that I havent heard from him for the next 3 days.I tried texting him but he wouldnt respond.
He skipped school the entire week the following week. He stopped going to the gym with me at the same time,we used to workout separately but I'd run into him and we'd chill after. Last monday he didnt show up where we used to sit with our other friends until 15 minutes before class resumes. Earlier today I ran into him in the hallway and chat a bit .He said see you at lunch but he wasnt there come lunch time,turned out he was with other friend.NORMALLY
I wouldnt over think it since he has the right to hang out with others other than me. But all these happened subsequently it sounds so fishy.

Do I have the right to feel confused and upset? I dont want to come off as clingy if I try to confront him since he is not my boyfriend.He doesnt know Im gay and I doubt he suspects. 


Clarifications: our school is a ""cram school"" where you upgrade high school classes you did not-so-well in. We are only in school for 3 days. We both already graduated high school.

I'm proud he felt comfortable enough to trust me and tell me but I'm a little lost about how to be a good father to him and how to relate to him.

Specifically, I'm kind of a jock, and was throughout high school and college. I've always urged/pushed my son to do the same but he never seemed interested except for weightlifting and I am fine with that. He's very gifted musically, intellectually and he's just really funny and witty.

But since it's been just the two of us since he was three (Mom's gone, never to be heard from again), I've always been very casual about nudity around the house. I often don't wear a shirt, sleep naked and get up in the morning walking around the house nude, shower and everything. Now if I'd had a daughter I never would have done any of this; it would have been so inappropriate and wrong. I'm wondering if it has had a bad or confusing effect on my son. I feel like a really bad Dad.

What do you guys think? I've been reading the gay subs a lot, trying to pick up information and tips. A big thanks to you all.

EDIT: Thanks to you all; I feel better, reassured. I've read a lot of incest posts on here and I now realize that they are the exception, not the rule. Like in all things, it seems to me, gay guys are just like straight guys with one difference that affects other things. Especially thanks for those who pointed out that a change now would not be a good thing. So I'm just going to be the dad I've always been. I think he's turned out pretty good so far.

I'm technically ""out"" but i guess on the down low and prefer to not show it off. I am friends, or atleast acquaintances with most of gay guys except 2 or 3 who I try to stay due to stories i heard from my best friend (i know that its bad i am shutting them off based on generalizations/stories but my friend has told me some pretty complicated shit about them [since she hangs out with them] that i dont want to be involved in and so I trust her , and also b/c of preference).  
  
A month ago, I downloaded Hornet on a whim just to see who's out there. By downloading the app, I was aware that there might be a possibility that some of my gay friends might be on it, and so I planned on blocking anyone who was from my school. I block them because i generally don't have any interest in dating them, only to be friends. Of course, one of the guys (lets call him G) who I try to stay away from is on there and so I blocked him. I went on for the rest of the week just trying to chat with people until i got constant erotic messages, which i then decided to just stop using it (and yes I know the consequences of these apps, and even if ""something"" were to happen, i wouldnt go through with it cause im a pussy).  
2 days ago, I decided to get back on to see if there was anything new. I get a few messages but there was one distinct message that creeped me out. it said  
""hey newflame21 (this person used my real name, which i did not put in my profile)   
do u dislike me""  
I got so scared that I just ignored and assumed that it was someone from my school. I go on my facebook for awhile and then get a message from G saying ""what did i do to u"" and ultimately connected the bits and pieces that it was him who messaged me on Hornet. G has a ""reputation"" among my friends in which he is described as a really creepy person. Going off on what a friend told me, she said that he tried to lure straight guys into having a ""thing"" with him [ie. one of her best guy friends] , and even though its all speculation from my side, I assume that most of the things that my friends have said about him would be true (and i know this makes me abit ignorant, but the stories about G were parallel to the way he interacts with guys vs. girls, its complicated). Also, he naturally gives off a creepy vibe..  
  
I just really want advice on how I can handle this situation. I intended to turn down this guy whenever he tries to come at me (this might be the 3rd or 4th time but he's persistent), but since he made a new account to try and get an explanation from me of why i dislike him/block him, I am tempted to tell him to stop leave me alone and lay off. Is this the right thing to do? Cause i am genuinely creeped out by this but by shutting him down, I feel like I would be the asshole of this situation and I want to avoid that as much as possible.  
  
Am I in the right to feel creeped out?  

Sorry if I seem shallow in this post, my preferences are somewhat picky which is probably going to be a problem in the future.. but even I can't change that.  
  
TL;DR: Blocked someone from my school a month ago in Hornet, that certain someone creates a new account and asks why I dislike him, which I ignore and then suddenly I get a message from someone in FB asking what he did to me to make me dislike him. Genuinely creeped out.
  


","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Background information: I am in high school with not many gay guys around to talk to and relate to. I&amp;#39;m technically &amp;quot;out&amp;quot; but i guess on the down low and prefer to not show it off. I am friends, or atleast acquaintances with most of gay guys except 2 or 3 who I try to stay due to stories i heard from my best friend (i know that its bad i am shutting them off based on generalizations/stories but my friend has told me some pretty complicated shit about them [since she hangs out with them] that i dont want to be involved in and so I trust her , and also b/c of preference).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A month ago, I downloaded Hornet on a whim just to see who&amp;#39;s out there. By downloading the app, I was aware that there might be a possibility that some of my gay friends might be on it, and so I planned on blocking anyone who was from my school. I block them because i generally don&amp;#39;t have any interest in dating them, only to be friends. Of course, one of the guys (lets call him G) who I try to stay away from is on there and so I blocked him. I went on for the rest of the week just trying to chat with people until i got constant erotic messages, which i then decided to just stop using it (and yes I know the consequences of these apps, and even if &amp;quot;something&amp;quot; were to happen, i wouldnt go through with it cause im a pussy).&lt;br/&gt;
2 days ago, I decided to get back on to see if there was anything new. I get a few messages but there was one distinct message that creeped me out. it said&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;quot;hey newflame21 (this person used my real name, which i did not put in my profile)&lt;br/&gt;
do u dislike me&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;
I got so scared that I just ignored and assumed that it was someone from my school. I go on my facebook for awhile and then get a message from G saying &amp;quot;what did i do to u&amp;quot; and ultimately connected the bits and pieces that it was him who messaged me on Hornet.

He's pretty cute and kind of want to date him. I've had a thing for him for a while and have recently tried to make some passes at him. We're decent friends, don't really hang out outside of class but we've IM'ed more than a few times.

We sit across from each other in Class A and I started lightly touching him, like touching his shoulder when I passed him or brushing up against him stuff like that. Last week, now I know how stupid this sounds but it worked so hear me out, I started...playing footsie. Now look! Before you say anything, we sit across from each other and sometimes our legs/feet touch so I gave it a shot. I started by pushing my foot against his, never looking at him incase it was weird. He didn't pull away so I just left it there, relishing the moment (pathetic I know haha). In about a minute or so he pulled away and I got pretty sad...until he pushed his shoe against my ankle for a few seconds before he put his shoe back down next to mine. It took everything in my power to not smile widely right then. It could have been nothing but it also could have been something. Every day after that we played more and the last two days it's gotten to the point where he rests his foot on top of mine and we glance at each other when the other one shifts. Sometimes he'll take his foot off and brush it against my leg, drives me a little wild haha.

Well today in Class B, we kind of took a ""field trip"" of sorts. It's a life finance class and I don't want to go into detail but we essentially found our class running around a walmart. We were in groups and my group was me, him, and a close friend (close friend doesn't know I'm gay). Well today I decided to try something more and see how he reacted. When we left the class (we walked to the store) I started purposefully touching him on the way and I almost gave up but when we got to the store he started touching back. I don't know if he was trying to be subtle and just failing at it or touching isn't that subtle to begin with and he knew the entire time I was touching him haha. 

When he started touching back (we never actually acknowledged each other touching besides sideways glances, it mostly happened when one of us was behind the other) we turned it into a kind of game. We'd wait until my friend wasn't looking and then quickly go for a touch.

Well, I wanted to test my waters even more after a bit of this. I pretended I was going down an aisle and he followed me but my friend kept going straight. He walked passed me and when I turned around to follow my friend he walked passed me again and I reached out and copped a feel of his ass. I formed it like a grab, but without the grab. It's kind of hard to describe but it was like a grab (starting with an open hand and cupping his ass, then closing it like a grab but just letting my fingers run over his pants instead of actually grabbing it). I kept walking and he stopped a bit, I was in between being scared it was too much and excited that I got to feel his ass (it was pretty firm). I followed my friend to the next aisle over and I could tell he was behind me. Now to preface, I grew up with too brothers and we wrestled A LOT. So I got to be sensitive and aggressive to sudden grabs, but in a joking way. I'm sure you can tell where this is going.

He came up behind me and grabbed my hip pretty hard. Now my instincts kicked in and I quickly turned around and said something like ""The hell you doing?"" and got up in his face, I did it jokingly but in the heat of the moment you couldn't tell I was joking (as many years of messing with brothers has taught me is that you have to appear aggressive at first to mess with them, I got pretty good at it). My friend had no idea what I was talking about but brushed it off. And then the guy got more distant and we didn't talk as much and there was no more touching after that :(

Could I have just ruined my chances with that guy?

Edit: I'm also hoping he sees this. Hes on reddit but I have no idea if he browses LGBT subreddits.

In my high school senior year I ended up skipping my prom. Yah, I didn't have any gal to go out with, and I felt super weird about asking a girl to go since I have no feelings for women.

I actually worked that day 8 hours at my job and broke down crying for thinking I was missing something super important.

But I realized that prom is really just a dance for straight kids. There was only one other gay guy in my graduating class and he is not someone I would have asked to the dance lol. 

I used to feel absolutely horrible about skipping prom but then I realized that one of my idols (Conan O' Brien) skipped his senior prom too. :)

Now before you judge me, keep in mind that A.) I went to a private Christian school and therefore would be kicked out if I took a guy lol.

B.) I went to school in the early 2000's when much homophobia was still going on.

So to give you some back story, I'm a 26yo bi-bro from a ""traditional"" (aka conservative) midwestern family. I discovered pretty early on that I was interested in both sexes and was pretty comfortable in my bisexuality by the age of 14 or 15. I came out to my parents and older sister when I was 16, which was actually a lot better than I imagined it going. When I told my sister she was just annoyed that I had wasted her time. ""Who cares GearlyBeloved? Just get out of my room!"" I was mostly nervous about my parents. I asked them if I could ""talk to them about something"" and was clearly upset and nervous about telling them whatever I was about to tell them. They both noticed my nervousness and looked very concerned, preparing for the worst. When I told them, my dad just shrugged and looked confused. It was the best reaction I could have gotten. ""Oh, that's it? I thought you were in trouble!"" My mom, however, was less thrilled. As the words ""I'm bi"" came out of my mouth, she let out an audible ""EUGH!"" and looked genuinely horrified and *disgusted*, which wasn't a great feeling. We talked it out, they both said they loved me and that this wouldn't change anything, hugs were shared, tears were shed (by me). It was a huge relief, originally thinking I would be disowned. For the most part, they are the same supportive and loving parents I've always known, but they have implemented an unspoken ""don't ask don't tell"" policy on the subject ever since. Though they ask my older sister every Thanksgiving if she's dating anyone, they've both generally stopped asking me (Dad sometimes will if my mom isn't in the room). They don't want to hear about it, so I'm not going to volunteer my personal life if they don't ask. My parents have both met boyfriends and girlfriends when they've visited me (I now live in Florida) and have been genuinely welcoming and loving. It's a little more awkward with the boyfriends, but after they get to know him, they always have nothing but nice things to say. It's not an ideal situation, but it's a lot better than most people would have, especially for someone coming from my small town in the middle of the country. Not perfect, but it works.

Probably the worst part of my coming out in high school was my mom's rule that I could not tell my little brother. He was 8 years old at the time and she was afraid of telling him at such a young age. I was still thrilled to be living under their roof and you do *not* break one of Mom's rules in my family, so I went along with her wishes. I now wish I hadn't. As I look at me and my brother's relationship, it's definitely not as close as I wish it were. My sister and I are incredibly close, talking on the phone almost daily. I really want the same thing with my brother but have so far been unable to talk to him on a personal level. I recently had a rough breakup with a longterm boyfriend that he knew nothing about. My sister was there for me, but I would have loved to have my brother in the mix as well.

Which brings me to my dilemma. I've been out to all my close friends, family, and loved ones for a decade now; everyone but my brother. I'm getting sick of this situation and I will be seeing him in about a month for his high school graduation, so I plan to tell him then. I know he won't have a bad reaction to my bisexuality at all (this kid has more gay friends than straight friends), but I am afraid of what he'll think when he finds out that everyone around him knew for years and didn't tell him. I don't want to lie about why I haven't told him, but I also don't want to throw my mom or my family under the bus. I also feel pretty guilty myself for not telling him sooner - I've had plenty of opportunities to tell him, but have always put it off because of how awkward I think it will be after so much time, which obviously only makes the problem bigger. I am 100% going to tell him when I see him in May. Anyone have any advice?

**TL;DR** : Came out to conservative parents 10 years ago and it went better than expected, but not perfect. They wouldn't let me tell my 8yo little brother, who is now 18 and still doesn't know. This has strained me and my brother's relationship and I want to tell him when I see him in a month, but don't know how to do so without hurting his feelings that he hasn't been told earlier.

So I'm currently a college student living in a dorm, and last December I met this one guy on Grindr and we immediately hit it off through chat. The next week we met up, and kissed but that was it. We met up again 2 days after that, and everything was great. We stayed up talking and kissing till four before I left. Now this was right before Christmas break and exams at our college would start, meaning the next time I'd see him would be in February. We talked every single day until we met up and everything was just amazing when we did. We fooled around for the first time and I thought I'd finally met someone who liked me for who I am.

Here's the catch though, he was still incredibly deep in the closet. And I thought I could handle it, but when the next semester began, him being a med student, and me studying engineering, we didnt really have a lot of time. He does go out a lot with his friends, and while I completely understood  his situation, it also made me realize that I didn't have a place in his life.

At around March things were getting pretty rocky, I was the one who had to initiate any meetups, and it kinda made me feel like he didn't want to make any plans with me, despite never having rejected any of my plans. I know I sound very clingy right now. But one day I kind of snapped, and although I apologized immediately afterwards, we still had to meetup to talk.

We broke up the next time we met up. He was in tears, I was trying not to cry. And exactly a week after that I asked him if we could get back together. I felt so much for him. However, h didn't know how, and I said we could take things slow.

Then over spring break we talked again every day. He was about to come out to his mom one night, but couldn't do it. I do need to say that I have never pressured him into coming out, and still up until today want to be there for him. When spring break was over and we met up again, he told me he thought about it and realized he couldn't be in a relationship right now. I was heartbroken and stormed off, the next day I apologized when we met up.

I really don't know if he still has feelings for me. This happened this week, and I still think about him all the time and it hurts. I still want to get back together with him, but not like this. And I think I'm holding on to the hope that when he does come out, everything will be better and we could get back together again. However, at the same I want to move on, I just don't know how. I still feel very strong feelings for him, and still want to support him through everything, but I just want stop having to think about it all the time.

I guess I also just feel defeated because despite giving it my all and opening my heart to him, I still wasnt enough.

Any advice? And sorry for the long post.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;m currently a college student living in a dorm, and last December I met this one guy on Grindr and we immediately hit it off through chat. The next week we met up, and kissed but that was it. We met up again 2 days after that, and everything was great. We stayed up talking and kissing till four before I left. Now this was right before Christmas break and exams at our college would start, meaning the next time I&amp;#39;d see him would be in February. We talked every single day until we met up and everything was just amazing when we did. We fooled around for the first time and I thought I&amp;#39;d finally met someone who liked me for who I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the catch though, he was still incredibly deep in the closet. And I thought I could handle it, but when the next semester began, him being a med student, and me studying engineering, we didnt really have a lot of time. He does go out a lot with his friends, and while I completely understood  his situation, it also made me realize that I didn&amp;#39;t have a place in his life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At around March things were getting pretty rocky, I was the one who had to initiate any meetups, and it kinda made me feel like he didn&amp;#39;t want to make any plans with me, despite never having rejected any of my plans. I know I sound very clingy right now. But one day I kind of snapped, and although I apologized immediately afterwards, we still had to meetup to talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We broke up the next time we met up. He was in tears, I was trying not to cry. And exactly a week after that I asked him if we could get back together. I felt so much for him. However, h didn&amp;#39;t know how, and I said we could take things slow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then over spring break we talked again every day. He was about to come out to his mom one night, but couldn&amp;#39;t do it. I do need to say that I have never pressured him into coming out, and still up until today want to be there for him. When spring break was over and we met up again, he told me he thought about it and realized he couldn&amp;#39;t be in a relationship right now. I was heartbroken and stormed off, the next day I apologized when we met up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really don&amp;#39;t know if he still has feelings for me. This happened this week, and I still think about him all the time and it hurts. I still want to get back together with him, but not like this. And I think I&amp;#39;m holding on to the hope that when he does come out, everything will be better and we could get back together again.

I'm 16, birthday in a few weeks, in high school, out to my mum, brother and about 6-8 friends. I'm in high school for 2 more years, I'm living with my mum in eastern europe, my dad lives in the UK.

So I made a post after I came out to my mum, she reacted well but it seems she's not exactly going to accept me very soon (or ever, it seems), she'll probably just tolerate it. 

She asked me to tell her whenever I came out to any of my friends in case they tell their parents and it gets back to her (I didn't see why this would be a problem if anyone asked her but I kept her updated anyway).

So now I'm comfortable with the idea of being out in school, I could deal with the hate. It's easy to pick on me but it doesn't seem to happen for some reason, maybe because I'm the smart one? I've heard that kids in other classes know about me and someone has even asked for my old notes... I'm super nerdy and no one has ever suspected or asked if I'm gay, I don't fit many stereotypes apart from my taste in music and the VERY subtle hints in my speaking (not high pitched, just elongated word endings like a casual bye will become byeee). I'm not the kind of person to go around just saying ""hey, I'm gay"" and I thought I could buy a ribbon or something ([like this](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00JXRU2YA/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;smid=A490QS1OFYPSU)), tie a bit to my bag and not say anything unless someone asks about it, though I think it gets the message across without having to ask.

My friends think it's a dumb idea and my mum would freak out if she found out I was doing it (she's a teacher at my school which doesn't help). When she asked how my friend reacted and I told her she said ""you know it's totally normal"", she responded ""it's not normal though is it? it's not how nature is"" (though this can be interpreted differently in Hungarian).

I want to be myself, talk about guys with my friends without having to keep quiet, make gay jokes that make them uncomfortable etc. etc. (ok maybe not the last part)

If I do do this, the first step will be coming out to my dad, where my second question comes in: is it appropriate to do it through skype? If I want to buy this ribbon I'll have to order it to our UK house and my dad would bring it for my birthday. Or should I not bother with the ribbon and tell my dad in person?

Any opinions welcome :) and thanks in advance.

**TL;DR** I want to let people know the real me without having to say anything and without rumours. I thought maybe I could tie a rainbow ribbon to my bag. Dumb idea or not? Any better ideas?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok, what you need to know about me before I splurge (obligatory &lt;strong&gt;wall of text warning&lt;/strong&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

My boyfriend and I met during our senior year of High school, and we've been together since, going on three years now. We both lived with his parents (closer to school, my house was about 15 miles away from it) for the rest of senior year and during my freshman year of college, which we attend together. 

Fast forward to now, we've been living in an apartment together for almost a year. When I first moved into the apartment, he decided that he didn't want to move in with me because he didn't want to have to pay his portion of the utilites/rent. However, about two weeks after I moved in, he decided to move in with me. Everything went downhill from there. For the first few months, we fought constantly because he wasn't paying a single thing and didn't want to get a job. We both got enough money back from our grants and scholarships to be able to split things equally without working, but he still refused. I finally talked him into paying for utilities while I covered rent, but it wasn't enough (our utilities combined were around $200, while rent was $400. Because of the huge imbalance, we fought over money frequently, because on top of this I was also expected to pay for a majority of the meals we ate, including dining out AND groceries. Finally, about two months ago, I'd had enough. I told him that he was going to have to start paying an equal share of everything or that he was going to have to move back in with his parents. He agreed to start paying for half of everything, and I thought things would be better. Except they aren't.

See, I still have to clean up everything. He refuses to help clean the apartment, refuses to do any laundry, refuses to help take care of our dog, and refuses to use his car to drive anywhere. Speaking of the dog, he was recently sick and had to be taken to the vet and ended up with a $1000 medical bill. Guess who has to pay for every penny of that?

It's been like this for most of our relationship, but I suppose it didn't weigh as heavily on me before we moved in to the apartment together. There have been many times where I say that I've had enough after trying to (peacefully) talk to him about him needing to help out, but he either refuses to listen by putting on headphones or leaving the room, or even worse he agrees with me and then never does anything. Today, I'd finally had enough. 

As soon as I woke up this morning, he was complaining that he was hungry and that he wanted me to take him to get something to eat because he didn't have any groceries (because he didn't buy any, and when I ask him what he wants when I have to buy them he never tells me) and for some reason he can't drive himself, even though he has a car that's just as good if not better than mine. So I agree to take him, get a shower and get ready, take him to get food, which he only buys for himself, and then take him back home and I start cleaning up. Everything is fine until I decide that I'm going to spend some time playing video games in my ""office"", which is really just an extra bedroom where I keep my desk/junk. The dog was laying on the bed beside him while he was on his laptop and he told me that I needed to take the dog in the office with me. I told him that the dog was fine and that he could keep an eye on him better than I could, because my desk faces a wall whereas from the head of the bead you can see all around the room.

When I said this, he rolled his eyes, shook his head, and started telling me about how it was stupid that he had to watch the dog all the time. I do admit that the dog stays around him most of the time because he is usually downstairs more than I am, and we don't let the dog come upstairs often because of the carpet and his tendency to pee on it. But that's the only thing he does. No cleaning, no laundry, no buying groceries, nothing. So when he started arguing with me about the dog something in me just snapped. I'd finally had enough. I'd had enough of having to take care of everything myself. I'd had enough of being expected to pay for everything, clean everything, do everything, and I'd certainly had enough of the way he's been treating me. So I told him that I wanted to have a conversation.

He ignored me, told me to shut up and go away and that he didn't want to talk to me. I couldn't handle it anymore. I walked over to the bed and shut his laptop and sat it down on the desk behind me, and said ""We're going to have a conversation about this, right now"". Now, I know that I probably should have just walked away at this point, but my blood was boiling and I was starting to see red. With everything I do, I just wanted him to do this one little thing for me, and he was acting like I was a tyrant, and I just couldn't handle it. He stood up and started trying to walk to the desk and get his computer, telling me that he wasn't having a conversation with me. He tried walking past me and I kept moving in his way, telling him that I wanted to talk. Eventually he tried forcing his way past me, and I pushed him back onto the bed. He still wasn't listening. We NEEDED to have a conversation about this, it was all starting to be too much. Everything went black. I remember pushing him out of the room onto the landing and pushing him against the wall. I was screaming things at him that I don't remember and I was probably hurting him by how hard I was pushing him against the wall. 

After that, I started to calm down. I went into the extra room and sat down in silence for about 10 minutes, then came here to ask for advice. I'm not a violent person. I don't even kill the bugs in my house, even if they're nasty bugs like cockroaches, or terrifying like spiders. I've never been violent with anyone else in my entire life, no fights, no anger issues, nothing. I feel like this relationship is bringing out the worst in me and I'm frightened. 

I don't know what my options are. I know the best solution would be to end the relationship, but I don't have the money to live here on my own, and this is the cheapest place in my area for over 100 miles. I've tried suggesting we spend some time apart by asking him to spend a day or two with his parents, but he refuses. He feels like it's just as much his apartment as it is mine since he (now) pays for half of everything, so he won't go. My parents have nowhere for me to stay, besides them being miles away.

I dated this guy for the better part of two years.

I should mention that he instigated the break up conversation but I would have if he didn't. 

One thing he said (multiple times) during that conversation is that he wanted to stay friends, I said something along the lines of ""that's just something people say"" and he was adamant that he was serious. I believed him. He had lunch frequently with his last ex and it seemed like they had a good relationship. The next day I texted him just to say hey and we talked for a bit, but towards the end of the conversation he said ""I meant be friends in several months, not right away. I think we both need time before that is an option."" I agreed as obviously he was right.

Skip ahead six months and he has now ignored two messages. Sent several weeks apart. I know I'm having issues with not being over him but I'm mostly just upset about him completely ignoring me. Why? I'm seriously lost as to why he would convince me that he wanted to be friends, while being friends with his other ex, but now give me NOTHING. I think this may be the push I need to move on, but I'm just confused and sort of disappointed. 

I guess the answer is people can change what they want at any time and has now decided he does not want to be friends. Just sucks he won't even tell me that.

Sorry this isn't so much a question as much as a rant. I already know the answer is to move on.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firstly sorry - I know this sort of post is made every second of every day but I just need somewhere to vent.&lt;/p&gt;
