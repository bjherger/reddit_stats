Throwaway although I do like the username. I'll try to keep this short. My BF (of 6 years) just returned from spending a couple nights in the hospital (nothing serious). 

He just told me that on the second night of his stay, he got moved to a room with an attractive dude around his age. They talked for a while and eventually my BF mentioned that he had a BF. Attractive hospital roomie says he is bi but has been celibate for several months. They start talking about things that are sexual in nature. Bi roomie says things like ""I mostly have sex with women"", ""wow, you're so manly"", ""I never bottom but I totally would for you right now"", etc. My BF politely tells roomie that isn't going to happen, but recounts certain experiences him and I have had while boning... very naughty experiences...

BF and bi roomie both end up hard. Bi roomie asks my BF how big he is, and BF exposes himself to bi roomie. My BF gets up to use the bathroom and Bi roomie asks my BF to jerk him off. My BF touches Bi roomie's wiener for ""about ten seconds"", and then uses the bathroom, no longer aroused. By the time my BF is done doing peeing, bi roomie has worked out a load. At no point does the roomie touch my BF. After that my BF and Bi roomie went to bed and bi roomie was discharged the next morning. 

I 100% believe that what my BF is saying is true. I don't think anything more or less than that happened. I'm not really upset, just surprised more than anything. In six years, nothing like this has EVER happened.

Has this happened to anyone else? I mean, what are the chances?? Had it been me, who knows, although to be fair if I was on tons of good drugs like my BF was that night, I would probably be down for anything haha. Just kinda wondering what your guys' take on the situation is.

I'm a 26 year old straight (?) male that has been married for almost 4 years. I guess you could say my first gay experience happened when I was a child. When I was around 5-6 years old I remember doing things with my uncle. My uncle wasn't an adult yet. I think he was around 14 or so at the time, but definitely old enough to know better. Anyway...I remember him basically convincing me to suck his dick. At the time I didn't really see anything wrong with it. To me we were just playing a game. After this happened I ""played the game"" with some of my friends which led me to have a lot of mixed thoughts and feelings about my sexuality. One time a friend, call him Steve, and I were caught by his little brother (Tom) messing around. Tom then told our parents. My mom asked why we were kissing and I told her it was because I liked him. She then told me that ""I like Mrs. Sarah (named changed for anonymity), but that doesn't mean I kiss her. Boys don't kiss boys"". After that, I never really did anything with anyone else of the same sex nor did I seem to be attracted to them.


Fast forward a bit and I just graduated high school. I lost my virginity to a girl I barely knew a few days after graduation, and to be honest, was kind of grossed out about the whole experience. I think it had something to do with the fact that I knew just how slutty this chick was. Anyway...about a month or so after that I have my own place and was working trying to save up money for college. I had my best friend from childhood come over; we'll call him John, to hit up the bars. This is in Louisiana where you had to be 18 to get into a bar and 21 to drink. I'm getting sidetracked again, but I digress. So John is staying the night over at my place. We go out to a few bars, have a couple of drinks, and head back home like the beta-fags we were (no offense). He was going to crash on the couch in the living room and I was in my room. A little while later I hear him watching one of my pornos and for some reason this turned me on. Like bad. All I could think about was the fact that my best friend was jerking off to porn just a few feet away from me. My dick gets rock hard as I imagined him stroking his cock. I don't know what came over me, but I peeked into the living room and sure as shit there he was dick in hand. After seeing this I couldn't stop myself and asked if he ""needed a hand"", corny I know, but to my surprise he said yes. Up until this point neither one of us had showed the slightest bit of attraction to each other, nor I know I definitely wasn't attracted to him growing up. After he said yes, I walked into the living room and we agreed we would help each other out. Being the horny fuck I was I decided I would go first and began sucking him off. I couldn't believe this was happening. Here I am, a straight, chick loving dude, and I'm going down on my best friend who not only seemed ok with this, but was rather enjoying himself. I mean it was a little unnerving. After a few minutes of me sucking he forces my head down so I am deep throating him (who knew I had that talent?) and then he came right into my mouth. No warning tap, no nothing. I spit that shit out, because let's face it, cum is gross tasting. After washing my mouth out at the sink, it was my turn. I sat down on the couch and he put me in his mouth. After one or two strokes, he says he can't do it. However, he agrees to give me a hand job instead. I was disappointed, but agreed. Once we finished we agree to never speak of what happened again. 


After this incident I went to a football game about a month later. I met a girl there and hooked up with her the next week. Then I decided to join the Navy. After boot camp and training school I went home for the first time on leave where I hooked up with another girl I started talking to before joining the Navy. Funny side story, she ended up marrying Steve, the guy my mom busted me with. I don't think he ever told her about that though. So after I leave home to go to my first command I didn't really do too much. Then my sister in law introduced me to a friend of hers form work. We started a long distance relationship and ended up engaged, but thankfully that fell apart. After the engagement I went a little crazy and had multiple one night stands. The girl I was engaged to was the 4th person I had sex with and by the end of the year I was at 16 girls; my now wife being one of them. 


My whole life I've been told that homosexuality was a sin and yada yada yada. What did you expect? I'm from Louisiana after all. Up until about 5 years ago I pretty much hated gays. To the point that I said if any of my [future] children turned out gay, I would no longer love them and would disown them. This of course made me feel pretty guilty knowing my own past. Once, I got away from a lot of the people that influenced me I realized that gays aren't ""evil"" or ""gross"" and I became a bit more accepting. By accepting I mean I didn't care what you did in the privacy of your own home as long as I didn't have to see it. Since then I have had to do a lot of soul searching which ultimately lead me to renouncing my faith in god (not necessarily relevant) as well as becoming more accepting of others and their lifestyle choices. I now believe everyone should have equal rights and that the biggest reason for people mistreating the LGBT community is religious doctrine. Again that is just my own personal thoughts. 


Now for the meat and potatoes. I am a happily married man (most of the time) and have changed many of my beliefs. Having done so, it has caused a great deal of confusion for me. My wife knows about the incident with my uncle and Steve, but has no idea about me and John. I am fairly open with her and she knows I have no problem with admitting if a man is attractive. With that being said, sometimes I feel like she is judging me. She asks me quite often if I am gay and has told me she would be ok with it. We would simply get a divorce and stay best friends. Even if I were to realize that I am gay, highly unlikely because of my love for tits and vaginas. I still couldn't see myself going shopping, talking about guys, or doing anything else stereotypical of gay males. Not that there is anything wrong with that, it's just not me. I had no idea such a thing as gaybros existed until I found it on reddit. If I were to be with a man, it would definitely be more of a bromance. So on to the questions. 


1.) Am I gay? 

I know it's a silly question to ask, and a very personal one at that, but am I? I mean, I don't really find men attractive, but I wouldn't say no to sucking a dick and doing other things if I were single and the right guy came along. 

2.) If I am not gay, what am I?

3.) Are there different levels of gayness?

4.) How do I go about telling my wife this?

5.) If I were to be with a man, how would I know what type I like? I mean, I know I wouldn’t  be into bears, but I don't want some super flamboyant sissy either. I guess I would want someone like me. 

6.) To piggy back on my previous question, is there a term for men that are attractive, very little body hair, and not obnoxiously gay or sissy’s. Basically men like me. God I sound like such a narcissist.

7.) If I were to become single, how does one go about finding someone of the same sex? Clubs aren't really my scene anymore. 

8.) I know about tops or bottoms, but how do you know which one you are? I mean, I could see myself doing a little bit of both I guess.

9.) Is there such a thing as someone that enjoys both top and bottom?

10.) Kind of back to the first question. Am I just convincing myself that I like men based off of everything that has happened in my past as well as my wife's comments? To me that sounds completely ridiculous. I mean, don't people usually try to talk themselves out of being gay rather that talk themselves into it? But at the same time, I don't feel gay. 

11.) Would being bi make me an outcast in both circles? I've heard that most gays don't like bi's. They say they are just pretending.

12.) What are some ways that I can truly figure out who I am?



I think that's it for now. I'm sure I will have more questions come up later. In the meantime, if you have any questions or need me to elaborate on anything, please feel free to ask. I will answer anything without giving too much away about my identity or anyone else’s. Thanks.
","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So this is probably going to be a long post and I don&amp;#39;t anticipate there being a TL;DR portion as it&amp;#39;s pretty complicated. If you really want you can just skip to the end where I will ask questions, but I think it best to read the story so that you can get a feel for where I am coming from. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a 26 year old straight (?) male that has been married for almost 4 years. I guess you could say my first gay experience happened when I was a child. When I was around 5-6 years old I remember doing things with my uncle. My uncle wasn&amp;#39;t an adult yet. I think he was around 14 or so at the time, but definitely old enough to know better. Anyway...I remember him basically convincing me to suck his dick. At the time I didn&amp;#39;t really see anything wrong with it. To me we were just playing a game. After this happened I &amp;quot;played the game&amp;quot; with some of my friends which led me to have a lot of mixed thoughts and feelings about my sexuality. One time a friend, call him Steve, and I were caught by his little brother (Tom) messing around. Tom then told our parents. My mom asked why we were kissing and I told her it was because I liked him. She then told me that &amp;quot;I like Mrs. Sarah (named changed for anonymity), but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean I kiss her. Boys don&amp;#39;t kiss boys&amp;quot;. After that, I never really did anything with anyone else of the same sex nor did I seem to be attracted to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward a bit and I just graduated high school. I lost my virginity to a girl I barely knew a few days after graduation, and to be honest, was kind of grossed out about the whole experience. I think it had something to do with the fact that I knew just how slutty this chick was. Anyway...about a month or so after that I have my own place and was working trying to save up money for college. I had my best friend from childhood come over; we&amp;#39;ll call him John, to hit up the bars. This is in Louisiana where you had to be 18 to get into a bar and 21 to drink. I&amp;#39;m getting sidetracked again, but I digress. So John is staying the night over at my place. We go out to a few bars, have a couple of drinks, and head back home like the beta-fags we were (no offense). He was going to crash on the couch in the living room and I was in my room. A little while later I hear him watching one of my pornos and for some reason this turned me on. Like bad. All I could think about was the fact that my best friend was jerking off to porn just a few feet away from me. My dick gets rock hard as I imagined him stroking his cock. I don&amp;#39;t know what came over me, but I peeked into the living room and sure as shit there he was dick in hand. After seeing this I couldn&amp;#39;t stop myself and asked if he &amp;quot;needed a hand&amp;quot;, corny I know, but to my surprise he said yes. Up until this point neither one of us had showed the slightest bit of attraction to each other, nor I know I definitely wasn&amp;#39;t attracted to him growing up. After he said yes, I walked into the living room and we agreed we would help each other out. Being the horny fuck I was I decided I would go first and began sucking him off. I couldn&amp;#39;t believe this was happening. Here I am, a straight, chick loving dude, and I&amp;#39;m going down on my best friend who not only seemed ok with this, but was rather enjoying himself. I mean it was a little unnerving. After a few minutes of me sucking he forces my head down so I am deep throating him (who knew I had that talent?) and then he came right into my mouth. No warning tap, no nothing. I spit that shit out, because let&amp;#39;s face it, cum is gross tasting. After washing my mouth out at the sink, it was my turn. I sat down on the couch and he put me in his mouth. After one or two strokes, he says he can&amp;#39;t do it. However, he agrees to give me a hand job instead. I was disappointed, but agreed. Once we finished we agree to never speak of what happened again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this incident I went to a football game about a month later. I met a girl there and hooked up with her the next week. Then I decided to join the Navy. After boot camp and training school I went home for the first time on leave where I hooked up with another girl I started talking to before joining the Navy. Funny side story, she ended up marrying Steve, the guy my mom busted me with. I don&amp;#39;t think he ever told her about that though. So after I leave home to go to my first command I didn&amp;#39;t really do too much. Then my sister in law introduced me to a friend of hers form work. We started a long distance relationship and ended up engaged, but thankfully that fell apart. After the engagement I went a little crazy and had multiple one night stands.

I'm new to the dating scene and have a question.  Ever since I was little I have gotten cold sores, but over time they became less frequent and I honestly kind of forgot about them.  Last night I made out and performed oral on a guy I started dating recently, and this morning I woke up with a cold sore.  Now I am very concerned that I may have passed this along even though I did not know I had an outbreak coming.

Also, the cold sores I get appear very mild compared to pictures I have seen online.  Is it possible they aren't a strand of the herpes virus?  My doctor gave me valtrax once a long while back and it somewhat helped, but never did a blood test or anything.

I'm not sure what my next step should be.  I really like this guy and don't wanna screw it up, OR get him infected.  I plan to get an STD test soon, even though I haven't really been sexually active beyond mutual jacking off in the past.  Should I tell him about this, and if so, how?

I'm writing this less for advice and more to just get this off my chest. Expressing this, I hope, will lead to a better sense of peace within my own heart as I know my now-ex boyfriend searches for peace within his.

I was in a relationship with a brilliant man who spent four years as part of an ex-gay ministry, living at a monastery that instilled in him intense feelings of internalized homophobia and guilt for being gay. He told me that it wasn't one of the ""electrodes on your testicles"" ministry, but, rather, they focused on the psychological and emotional. As I understand it, this was probably far more damaging to his psyche than any physical torment, as he was racked with intense guilt for being gay.

So, after four years he left his ministry and monastery and moved back ""in the world."" He did this, he told me, because the leadership of the monastery changed and he felt like it wasn't a home anymore. So he moved in with former monastery members and essentially continued interacting with the same community; however, he ""grew weary"" (his words) of resisting homosexual urges and started hooking up with guys.

Then we started dating. I was his first relationship, and it was obvious. To him, 'gay' was something to be hidden and denied. Once, we were hanging out at his place, listening to music and making out like teenagers (which, to me, is the best part of dating) when he heard the front door open. He immediately recoiled from me and moved a few feet away. He started whispering that he can't let his roommates know that he ""isn't following Jesus"" anymore.

That crushed me, then. For multiple reasons - on the one hand, I felt intense empathy for his ambivalent feelings regarding homosexuality. I knew he was in pain, and I tried to provide as low-stress, low-expectation environments as possible. But on the other... it was a rejection. Every time his anxiety over gayness manifested, it was a rejection of me, of us, and of the ideals that I respect - that my love is worth the same as a straight person, that I'm worth being with someone who can treasure and cherish that love.

Anyways... at the start of the week I got a text at work saying that he ""needed to talk."" He mentioned that he's been having problems reconciling his sexuality and his faith. And when I called him, he told me that the night before he hooked up with another guy, someone he knew before me, someone close by to him. So he cheated, and then, today, we finally talked about everything and that was that. He isn't settled. And he can't be in a relationship with another man. And that just made me feel like shit.

We formally broke up, and I'm feeling like shit. And I just wanted to bring it up here to share this pain, hopefully with some others who've lost their others due to toxic faiths. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi guys,&lt;/p&gt;

Every time his anxiety over gayness manifested, it was a rejection of me, of us, and of the ideals that I respect - that my love is worth the same as a straight person, that I&amp;#39;m worth being with someone who can treasure and cherish that love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways... at the start of the week I got a text at work saying that he &amp;quot;needed to talk.&amp;quot; He mentioned that he&amp;#39;s been having problems reconciling his sexuality and his faith. And when I called him, he told me that the night before he hooked up with another guy, someone he knew before me, someone close by to him. So he cheated, and then, today, we finally talked about everything and that was that. He isn&amp;#39;t settled. And he can&amp;#39;t be in a relationship with another man. And that just made me feel like shit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We formally broke up, and I&amp;#39;m feeling like shit. And I just wanted to bring it up here to share this pain, hopefully with some others who&amp;#39;ve lost their others due to toxic faiths. &lt;/p&gt;

So yes, I am now 31 and have never been in a relationship with anyone and have never had a sexual encounter with anyone. I was raised Mormon, and only started identifying as gay about three years ago. The last couple of years I have stopped being active in the LDS church and have come out to my immediate family and a few other people. I have also been attending activities and meetings of a gay Mormon support group called Affirmation that supports gay relationships and welcomes people no matter their relationship with the church. Online dating has been a spectacular failure.

I think that there are a few things holding me back.  I really have no social skills, I am a constant misfit and I feel like I'm a couple degrees off of everyone around me. I don't think I've made friends with anyone since I was six, although I have had people make friends with me. That has been very infrequent occurrence however. I have been often told that I am a good person, but I don't think I'm someone people want to be around. I am very shy, talk very little, and don't really have anything interesting about me. I am also very self-conscious about my body, a subject that should probably go in another thread.

I am not really interested in hooking up, I would prefer that sex happen within the confines of a relationship. I have also made the decision to not drink alcohol for a variety of reasons, not just because I grew up with it being forbidden. I don't like dancing and partying which kind of excludes me from a large part of the community. Also I don't  ""look"" or act gay which is also a hindrance, but I'm not a ""bro"" type either.

Anyways, my life is better than that is has ever been, but I feel like I really missed the boat on a lot of things and feel like life is passing me by. My previous experiences of working with a therapist were quite negative and I have been reluctant to try again. 

So, there it is. I would appreciate hearing from others who have gone through similar experiences and appreciate anyone who bothers reading all of my wining.

I've been pretty down in the dumps about my situation over the past little while so i'm turning to this site as a bit of a last resort. 

The guy that i've been seeing for the past 9 months or so is not out of the closet. When we first started hanging out, he actually still had a girlfriend.. which made me uncomfortable but at the same time, I ignored it because he just seemed too perfect for me. Mostly because i've never been attracted to feminine guys and have a very specific image of the kind of guy I could picture myself with, so when he came along and fit the bill I was hooked. So I ignored the girlfriend and continued to hangout with him on a regular basis, where things quickly went from casual hangouts, to drinking, to kissing and cuddling, to basically this twisted confusing side relationship that I never understood or was satisfied with. When I asked him to make a decision, he chose his girlfriend and said that they had been through too much for him to leave her, but that he really did have feelings for me and wanted to keep being friends. I said yes, but I could tell things were different. He never texted me anymore and didn't seem very interested when we did occasionally talk. So I snapped a bit.. I didn't understand how we could go from talking and hanging out all the time to just nothing. No connection. He just cut me off. There was a bit of a falling out, I got emotionally worked up and asked him if there was any chance of something between us. To which he replied that he thought I should move on, because he didn't want me to miss out on relationships in my life because he wasn't ready to come out. I was really sad about it for a long time but eventually decided that his commitment to his girlfriend would mean that he would never have room for me in his life. 

Anyway, fast forward another couple of months to now, and now he's not together with his girlfriend and wants to hang out again (despite the fact that he told me before to move on and forget about my feelings for him). The exact same thing started happening. We started hanging out, drinking, kissing, cuddling, only now he seems like he's opened up a bit. He kissed me in front of my friends when we were drinking at home and held my hand when we went for a walk at night. We were still drunk when it happened but it meant a lot to me. And this all seems fine and dandy, but when I confront him about what we are and what I mean to him, he tells me that he's confused about what he wants. Meaning I thought it would be different this time but really nothing has changed.  He said that he's not out to his family or anyone and he still is attracted to girls... he loves hanging out with me but doesn't know what we are. I guess what bugged me about what he said the most was that he's still attracted to girls. Like i'm just an experiment to see what he wants in his life. He's a really popular good looking guy and i'm almost positive that he's still sleeping with girls on the side, but I don't know what to do. I don't want to be sad anymore because he refuses to acknowledge me or introduce me to his friends/family. But I don't want to overreact and end something that could eventually turn into a real relationship with a guy who i'm so hooked on. 

I didn't realize this was getting so long but if you guys have any advice it would be appreciated. I'm at the point where I'm about to pass up my dream guy because it hurts too much to live in his shadows, even though I love our time together more than anything. Even if it is only pretend.

I would like to pursue a relationship with this person whom we'll call D. D is a dominant top, I am a submissive bottom. He regularly posts on social media about his sexual conquests, with photos and videos (but without showing his face). It is hard to explain but he has fans and followers.

I met him a couple of times already for sex. On our last meetup we talked for a bit and came to the conclusion that we like each other. D then posts about me (using code words) on social accounts so his followers would know how much he likes me. It feels like he is courting me publicly. He would also send me sweet private messages. We will meet again to talk tomorrow.

However, he still keeps posting photos and videos of new partners. He still meets new bottoms, and he also posts about cruising in spas. In short, he's still very much sexually promiscuous while pursuing me.

I know this may sound stupid, but is he serious about me? Or is he just promiscuous and I should not feel confused about this? Should I cancel the upcoming date? I like him so much and I feel like he should not fuck around anymore.

Feel free to call me dumb below.
