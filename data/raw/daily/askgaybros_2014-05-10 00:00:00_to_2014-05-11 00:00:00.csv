It really messed with me that he didn't want more. I broke the most important rule in this sort of relationship and that's my fault.

Anyway we ended after 8+ months when I left the country and it was mutual. We both did shitty things in the end and lied about stuff. He kind of let me down when I kinda told him I kinda liked him more than a fwb. He told me he needs to try a girl too and all this other stuff. Eventually I realised that I was in love with the idea of a relationship more than anything. I've grown up, came out to most people. Closeted young guys do some crazy shit btw. I think I've changed enough to not be stupid anymore. 

Well I moved back home and he messages me on grindr not knowing it's me and of course it's going to lead to us us planning a hook up again. Not gonna lie I was deep in the dumps about other stuff like in the middle of planning something, anyway I was glad he messaged me. I wasn't going to text him. I thought he moved on and it was best for me  pto stay away at the time. I saw him on another dating site earlier and blocked him, deleted my account and planned to just go celibate for some reason.

He's slightly younger and I totally understand his desire to be closeted for a while, just to be straight while he has fun with his friends and stuff. Maybe his parents aren't that accepting either. I tried not to pry in our pillow talks I wouldn't mind helping him with his sexuality either past our short conversation on the topic.

 So am I putting myself through more heartbreak if I meet with him again? I stupidly told him we can meet when I fix the car because he wanted to meet like right after we talked. I can't stop thinking of him because there's always this potential it could be something more yet I know it's about the sex.

I apologise but this is about to be a really long post. You can even tackle them one paragraph at a time if you like.

Quick details about me: 21, gay, student. Out to all my friends; literally just came out to my parents a week ago. Decided a long time ago that the whole hook-up thing wasn't for me (blame my Catholic upbringing) and since I don't hang out with anyone remotely gay and go to uni in the middle of nowhere I have been alone thus far.

So about two months ago I started chatting to this guy on Grindr and we really hit it off. He's 23 and, rather alluringly, has a very promising career as an engineer. A month and a half later we're dating exclusively... and (argh!) FB official. None of this I have a problem with because I really like him. But I have some insecurities as well, and things I'm not sure I should bring up with him or not.

This guy is my first everything, basically. Not my first kiss, but the first one I actually liked, and I'm not a virgin in the strictest sense of the word but my first time was really shitty and I didn't even ""finish"" (literally walked out on the guy because he was such a cunt). Definitely my first date though, and I have legitimate feelings for this guy. But I'm not exactly experienced and our first attempt at intimacy (oral only so far) didn't go so well--I had some major nerves at the time and got overwhelmed and couldn't get hard, which I was super embarrassed about. We've tried again another time since which was going alright until I remember the first time and lost it out of sheer fright. I've found that wanking to him mentally has helped but I'm scared that the next time is going to go equally as bad and I feel like such a disappointment to him. Has anyone been in a similar situation before? How did you manage to own it?

Another thing is that I know he liked a guy a LOT up until last year or so and when I hear him talk about him I can tell that he still likes him. I think he may have fallen for a straight guy but he'd been wishfully thinking that the guy might be secretly gay. Again this was some time ago but talking about it with him upsets me a little because being the insecure kid I am I keep feeling like he would still up and leave for this guy if this opportunity presented itself. I don't know whether I'm just being paranoid or if my fears are legitimate. In addition to this hearing him talk about other guys in general--especially the ones he's hooked up with--makes me really jealous. I feel like it might be because I know I'm going to be really crap in the sack for a while (and I think he does too) and these guys knew what they were doing... Anyway, I'm trying not to be the jealous guy but I really just can't help it sometimes. The thought of him with anyone else kind of kills me--in my head it's like anyone who wasn't me didn't appreciate him the way I do. I know it's egocentric. I know, I know, I know...

This one is more general than gay but I've met his work friends a few times and... god, it's weird. Almost overwhelming. They were work friends so of course the topic of the conversation inevitably goes to work which is difficult for me to contribute to and/or keep up with. Is it too much to expect that he could at least try and talk about something that I can talk about as well? It's not like I expect him to figuratively hold my hand through every social function but it would have been good to be able to talk to him. After all, I go to these things to be with him, not to hang out with his friends. Not that I don't like them, but they're not my friends. I want to do a bit of mingling on my own but admittedly I don't do well when I'm thrust into the deep end like this. Speaking of handholding, he's still uncomfortable with PDAs to the point where he won't hold my hand even in a more casual setting. I'm trying not to fault him for it because these are people he works with but at the same time it was a social function, not a work function. It's like this on our dates as well--he can't deal with the weird looks and double takes whereas I handle it a lot better (""no fucks given"" approach). I'm trying to be patient but I can't help but feel a little hurt when he won't let me show affection for him. Any tips for easing someone into this? Is it normal for gay couples to still not do PDAs well into a relationship?

Lastly, we seem to have fallen into a pattern of going on a date and making out in the car for an hour afterwards. It's nice, but we're both kind of concerned that we're turning the whole thing into a formula and I have no idea where to go from here. We live quite far apart (an hour's drive) so it's difficult for us to just hang out and both of us still live with our parents whom we are out to but nonetheless it's still weird bringing a guy home for the both of us. I mean like, where do we go from here? I want to go somewhere where it's just us and there's no chance of getting weird looks from people when we hold hands but I'm lost.

I feel like I've got a lot of growing up to do and the past few weeks have been a crash-course in relationships with lessons and anecdotes from friends. I'm trying really hard not to screw this up because I think we have a real shot together but I just don't know what I'm doing. Anything you guys have to contribute, whether it's a word of encouragement or to call me an insecure kid would be much appreciated.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;the tl;dr: I&amp;#39;m in my first relationship and I have no idea what I&amp;#39;m doing.

But I&amp;#39;m not exactly experienced and our first attempt at intimacy (oral only so far) didn&amp;#39;t go so well--I had some major nerves at the time and got overwhelmed and couldn&amp;#39;t get hard, which I was super embarrassed about. We&amp;#39;ve tried again another time since which was going alright until I remember the first time and lost it out of sheer fright. I&amp;#39;ve found that wanking to him mentally has helped but I&amp;#39;m scared that the next time is going to go equally as bad and I feel like such a disappointment to him. Has anyone been in a similar situation before? How did you manage to own it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing is that I know he liked a guy a LOT up until last year or so and when I hear him talk about him I can tell that he still likes him. I think he may have fallen for a straight guy but he&amp;#39;d been wishfully thinking that the guy might be secretly gay. Again this was some time ago but talking about it with him upsets me a little because being the insecure kid I am I keep feeling like he would still up and leave for this guy if this opportunity presented itself. I don&amp;#39;t know whether I&amp;#39;m just being paranoid or if my fears are legitimate. In addition to this hearing him talk about other guys in general--especially the ones he&amp;#39;s hooked up with--makes me really jealous. I feel like it might be because I know I&amp;#39;m going to be really crap in the sack for a while (and I think he does too) and these guys knew what they were doing... Anyway, I&amp;#39;m trying not to be the jealous guy but I really just can&amp;#39;t help it sometimes. The thought of him with anyone else kind of kills me--in my head it&amp;#39;s like anyone who wasn&amp;#39;t me didn&amp;#39;t appreciate him the way I do. I know it&amp;#39;s egocentric. I know, I know, I know...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is more general than gay but I&amp;#39;ve met his work friends a few times and... god, it&amp;#39;s weird. Almost overwhelming. They were work friends so of course the topic of the conversation inevitably goes to work which is difficult for me to contribute to and/or keep up with. Is it too much to expect that he could at least try and talk about something that I can talk about as well? It&amp;#39;s not like I expect him to figuratively hold my hand through every social function but it would have been good to be able to talk to him. After all, I go to these things to be with him, not to hang out with his friends. Not that I don&amp;#39;t like them, but they&amp;#39;re not my friends. I want to do a bit of mingling on my own but admittedly I don&amp;#39;t do well when I&amp;#39;m thrust into the deep end like this. Speaking of handholding, he&amp;#39;s still uncomfortable with PDAs to the point where he won&amp;#39;t hold my hand even in a more casual setting. I&amp;#39;m trying not to fault him for it because these are people he works with but at the same time it was a social function, not a work function. It&amp;#39;s like this on our dates as well--he can&amp;#39;t deal with the weird looks and double takes whereas I handle it a lot better (&amp;quot;no fucks given&amp;quot; approach). I&amp;#39;m trying to be patient but I can&amp;#39;t help but feel a little hurt when he won&amp;#39;t let me show affection for him. Any tips for easing someone into this? Is it normal for gay couples to still not do PDAs well into a relationship?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, we seem to have fallen into a pattern of going on a date and making out in the car for an hour afterwards. It&amp;#39;s nice, but we&amp;#39;re both kind of concerned that we&amp;#39;re turning the whole thing into a formula and I have no idea where to go from here. We live quite far apart (an hour&amp;#39;s drive) so it&amp;#39;s difficult for us to just hang out and both of us still live with our parents whom we are out to but nonetheless it&amp;#39;s still weird bringing a guy home for the both of us. I mean like, where do we go from here? I want to go somewhere where it&amp;#39;s just us and there&amp;#39;s no chance of getting weird looks from people when we hold hands but I&amp;#39;m lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like I&amp;#39;ve got a lot of growing up to do and the past few weeks have been a crash-course in relationships with lessons and anecdotes from friends. I&amp;#39;m trying really hard not to screw this up because I think we have a real shot together but I just don&amp;#39;t know what I&amp;#39;m doing. Anything you guys have to contribute, whether it&amp;#39;s a word of encouragement or to call me an insecure kid would be much appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

At the beginning of this semester I was talking to a guy on tinder. We talked for about a week. We had a ton in common, liked similar movies, had aspirations in the same areas, wanted to travel after college, even had similar areas of study. We got a long fantastically and had a ton of :)'s and I even opened up a little bit. we talked about how we should definitely play tennis and stuff once summer came. Then we made plans to hang out, we had everything set except the time he would pick me up. Suddenly he stops messaging me at all. Admittedly my self-esteem kind of sucks especially after last semester where i had literally no romantic connections, or even options, despite the fact I'm not unattractive. But I got into one of my depressed states, couldn't focus on anything, couldn't seem to distract myself, even though I knew that's exactly what I should be doing to work myself out of it. That day came and past, he never messaged me, I was glued to my phone the entire day, no messages came. After talking to one guy i knew who knew him, I found out that something similar happened to one of my friends with this guy after they hung out once. 

Fast forward to the beginning of April. A guy messages me on grindr which i had just gotten back, and I randomly hang out with this guy and we get along super well! we eat and go for a walk on a forest path and even go climb some rougher terrain and hang out by a lake. We literally hung out everyday from sunday-thursday having a great time. It seemed pretty romantic at the time, we were both pretty awkward and didn't even kiss still the 3rd day. On these days we'd go for late night walks cuddle on benches, etc. I even deleted grindr cause i figured it was going somewhere However, the next week he was super busy, things kept coming up such as his cat dying, etc. I told him it was fine, but everyday he was suddenly too busy again. I got a little paranoid after last time, I also noticed that he added a few guys on facebook those days that I had seen on grindr. I told him that I would rather him tell me he didn't want to hang out anymore, than him lead me on, that I understood if he was truely busy, i just wanted him to be straight up with me. He assured me he did really want to hang out, but it was just a tough week. This was like 4 weeks ago, we snapchat occasionally but they keep getting fewer and farther between. Every week he's apparently too busy. So this week i said, ""fuck it"" after spending most of april going from super depressed that he wouldn't message me back ever and super hopeful the few times we had little snapchat convo's. I message him once about when he might be available to hang out and vow to myself that I won't message him again until he messages me back.

So I install Tinder, cause I just really want someone to connect with and spend some time with this summer. I start talking to this really attractive nice guy like 5 days ago, we make plans to hang out a certain time today at 5:30, however he messages me this morning and tells me that he's gonna have to cut out early for his friend's party he'd promised he'd go to at like 9. I said it was fine, i totally get it. Then he messages me around 12 and says that he'll pry have to reschedule cause his brother guilted him into getting him from a far away town and it was in the middle of his massive load of laundry, and it might end up being too much of a rush to hang out. I said it was fine, let him know when I'd be free to reschedule, this was around 2. He still hasn't messaged back, which is probably cause he's busy, but I'm getting stupid, crazy, and depressed because I feel like its the same thing. i also noticed he just added one of my gay friends on facebook, so I asked that friend if he was flakey, and he said that the guy was super nice, that they had hung out a few days ago and they had a great time, he doesn't think he's flakey. He also mentioned that he had also been told these things. So in all actuallity he's probably busy.

Somehow I don't feel better and I'm super self-conscious about this whole damn semester. I know this sounds like creepy stalker behavior on my part, due to all the facebook checking. I just can't seem to get myself out of my head.

I know people in the gay community in particular tend to have the opinion that bi guys just haven't accepted that they're really gay and kind of treat being bi as a stepping stone of sorts. Which, I get, and really makes sense at times. It's only recently that I've actually realised that I might be gay (despite how odd that sounds) since there was always an attraction towards guys since puberty. I'm really kind of coming to terms with it as a possibility, and you know, I'm actually quite comfortable with it now! Still, I would be lying if I said that I was never attracted to girls.

I've had quite a few crushes on girls throughout my life. It's only recently that I've come to realise that these weren't solely based on physical attraction. It seems that they've all been more of an emotional connection though if that makes sense. In fact, they've all had brilliant smiles which is associated with trust and so on if you wanna get psychological. That being said, there was still a physical attraction and I get turned on by straight and lesbian porn for the most part, but there's definitely a gay preference. I don't really think it's as black and white as people tend to believe. We all like different things, none of which are labels!

It's only recently though that I've felt an emotional connection towards another guy. Alright, I get that's not what everyone likes but it means a lot to me. This guy who I only briefly know from uni seems to like me too, but I kinda fear it's more lust (which is fine whatever, but not so much what I'm looking for now). Like he's a really nice guy and I've opened up to him a lot, but only through texting. I've also never texted anyone a tenth of how much we text. It does feel like a relationship at times minus the whole seeing each other, which is a bit weird. I've only seen him like ten times ever yet we've talked most days in the last few months, often all throughout the day.

Thing is, I'm not sure if this is something I want. He's a handsome guy and we get along great but I feel like I'm leading him on sometimes. And every time he like flirts I never really reply directly. Also, I really don't know what I went in general, which doesn't exactly help here. It's just all kind of a mess the last few months. Not only this, but if I asked him out or whatever I haven't come out to anyone. It's not like my family and friends would mind, in fact they're actually so supportive. I just don't know if this is me or what I want, if that makes sense? I feel like I'm in the same situation as I was months ago too and not really any progress.

I'm just really interested in some outside advice. I feel like some people will say to just go for it, while others will say to do what makes me happy I guess? I dunno bros. Advice is just so welcome right now!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, so I just wanna first say that I&amp;#39;m really new to reddit but this subforum just seems so perfect.

JOB DETAIL

ABOUT MY WORK &amp; ME — I'm a 42yo software developer. I design and build apps for small &amp; medium-sized business. The apps are highly customized for each client and not sold publicly, so you've never heard of any of them. I'm self-taught, my skills are top-notch, and clients pay $60-$100 per hour for me to analyze their business, help them reduce overhead, and develop high-quality software with low maintenance costs.

However, I'm pretty poor at maintaining a healthy balance of work, health, money, friends, family, etc. When I'm working on a big project, I won't eat or sleep right, won't exercise, won't call people back or think about anything until I'm satisified with my work. Having made and saved money, I'll take a few months off, travel or spend a lot of quality time with my nephews (coaching them in football, takng them snowboarding, doing Boy Scout stuff, etc), until I start to run out of money, then find another project and do it over. It's something of a bohemiam lifestyle, I'm my own boss and that's great. But because I struggle to keep things in balance, it's often a bumpy road.

Things are lining up well at the moment. I have a Junior Developer, as well as a former protegé I'm partnering with to take on bigger jobs. I see how they work better with their supportive girlfriends and wives. I've discovered I work best with a learnedly young man who can play an active role in helping me meet my goals, and also appreciates having a trustworthy mentor and friend from whom he can gain valuable insight and profitable skills. My overall goal is self-improvement, so I'm looking for a young man who wants to take that journey with me as well as play a supporting role.


DUTIES

PERSONAL ASSISTANT / JACK OF ALL TRADES — Perform standard tasks on a daily basis, such as responding to email, managing my calendar, organizing files, sending out bills to clients, reviewing proposals, setting up trainings, making travel arrangements, etc. You should start to get a sense of how I think and operate, and the more you can do without me, the more of my time I can bill to clients. Things we would do together would be producing tech video segments on YouTube as part of my geek training series. Or, if I want you to be an assistant coach with me for my 10yo nephew's soccer league for six weeks, you should be up for it even if you have no coaching experience. Take guitar or language lessons with me? I'm looking for someone who is enthusiastic about doing anything he can to help me fulfill my goals.

FITNESS &amp; NUTRITION — You and I get on the same workout plan aimed at muscle development, endurance and flexibility. We also come up with a nutrition plan and motivate each other to follow it, including vitamin and caloric awareness, sharing meals, etc. I enjoy cooking and eating healthy. I like long hikes (15+ miles), and long bike rides (40+ miles). I love camping, swimming, skydiving, most board sports, and generally like being active all the time. You should have a similar sense of adventure. It would be liberating to feel comfortable naked around each other since I was raised with the opposite idea.

JUNIOR SOFTWARE DEVELOPER — I could work with someone who did not have this skillset, but here's why it's so valuable for both of us. A: Unlike with the other roles, this one generates income. Let's say I pay you $10/h on a project, but I bill your time to the client at $20/h. You get paid to learn, the client pays way less for the same high-quality work that I supervise, I recover some costs, and it helps free my time so I can bill clients at my high rate — this way we're both maximizing our earning power. B: I enjoy teaching and will teach you everything I know about software development. C: Your rate will be low at first, but after an immersive year training with me, you'll be able to earn $30-$40/h on your own. D: The more meaningful involvement you have on my client projects, the more earning power you gain. 


OUR PERSONAL/WORKING RELATIONSHIP

COMPANION / CONFIDANT — Apart from the more rational duties, you are, like me, a good listener. I have to trust you enough to introduce you to my family (nephews, grandmother, parents, etc). I think about a lot of things deeply, sometimes too much. I respond very well when prompted to stay focused in a positive and engaging way, and keeping me focused is a big part of your job. I often have warped estimations of time. And sometimes I just need a good kick in the pants to get something done. Spending a lot of time together, our relationship will be necessarily intense at times. Taking breaks from each other is important for our sanity, as is a sense of humor. If you can make me laugh and/or let me know you understand my point of view, you can help me through anything.

DEDICATION — I need someone who has TIME enough to take me on as a full-time project. If you've got a lot of school or are super busy and can't make time for me or aren't willing to travel, it won't work. You must make my goals and priorities your own, and frankly make me first in your life for this one year.
	
LIVING &amp; TRAVELING — After we've established mutual trust, we can consider living together in Los Angeles. You would have your own room, and a third room is set aside as our office/work space. On the travel front, the plan is to spend about two months each in Peru, India and/or Colorado while working and exploring, maybe take some cooking classes and make some hot friends along the way. I'm often bashful, but the truth is I like being put in different social situations and meeting people.

SEX — Because I'm an older man attracted to younger men, I want to be clear about sexual attitudes and expectations. I like being adventurous at times. If we're in Hawaii and I bring back two hot locals I met at the family beach who want to screw around, that can't evoke jealousy or judgment from you. I'm not a big player, but this kind of horny *finds me* from time to time and hell yeah I'm into it. If that kind of thing makes you uncomfortable, then we're not a good match. I'm genuinely stoked for my friends when they're getting laid; you should be too! Any sexual contact between you and I would have to be consensual and voluntary and safe, and never required or paid for. I won't tolerate sex addiction, heavy drugs, barebacking strangers, lights-out parties, or any high-risk, reckless behavior. Your health &amp; safety are actually incredibly important to me, as mine should be to you.

ROMANCE — Achieving my goals is far, far more important to me than finding true love (for now). If after our year together you can put up with me and we're madly in love, lucky us. I like a good cuddle here and there, and it warms me up to have a younger bro fall asleep on my shoulder on planes and trains. But beyond that kind of thing I'd rather not complicate our relationship with the volatility or expectation of romance, let alone monogamy. I might have one or two flings in a year, but my goals and my relationship with you come first during our contract year.

DISCRETION — This job is unique in that not only are you aiding me professionally, but also quite personally. I need to be able to trust you to use proper discretion when dealing with either. You can expect the same of me.

PAY, BONUS, HOURS, TIMING

This is a fair and honest living, and I'll likewise expect you to share some costs like food and bills, as well as pay your own taxes. I don't want to be your sugar daddy, so it's important that you earn your own money and take this job seriously. Below is the pay structure. How quickly you move from one stage to the next depends on your usefulness, how many responsibilities you're taking on, how much you help me increase my productivity, achieve focus and complete goals:

	Probation:
	• Stage 0: No pay. Get to know each other over 1-2 wks via videochat or IRL; get on the same workout routine.
	• Stage 1: $10/h, 10h/wk + 10h/wk free training. (Must move to Stage 2 by week 6 or sooner)
	• Stage 2: $15/h, 20h/wk + 10h/wk free training. (Must move to Stage 3 by week 12 or sooner)

	Contract:
	• Stage 3: $20/h, 32h or more per week.
	• Stage 4: $10K bonus (see below).

BONUS — If you've stuck with me the entire year, and have helped me ahieve key goals, if you've been reliable and honest and done a terrific job, I will be happily offer a $10,000 bonus in escrow on condition of meeting milestones that will set out at the beginning of the contract.

COMMITMENT &amp; TIMING — Our time needs to be compressed to one year so as to stay focused on accomplishing goals. The right candidate likes pushing someone like me to his personal best, and sees this job as a springboard for better living. If we really are an amazing duo, we can go another year with bigger goals, we can discuss health &amp; dental insurance, etc. But building mutual trust is obviously important before making any big moves, and that will take a little time. Together we'll define our terms clearly and move forward with a healthy balance of caution and *carpe diem*.


MY GOALS

These are some (not all) of my top goals for the next year:

	• Get in peak physical shape (I recently had a severe shoulder injury and need to start therapy, and might even need surgery. I will need moral support since this injury is frustrating).
	• Grow my business, earn US$10K+ every month (I do this some months, but it's not usual); pay debts, save money. 
	• Compete in a marathon and/or triathlon.
	• Teach software development classes in foreign countries, show them how to find clients and maintain their business . while recruiting students to work for me as junior developers. Get to know fun, cute boys along the way.
	• Greatly improve my guitar skills.
	• Take classes: Nutrition, Industrial Electricity.
	• Coach my nephews in one winning season of football soccer, or another sport.


ABOUT YOU

For starters, you should already be in the the Los Angeles area, and have the interest and most critically the time to dedicate to everything I've written about. In terms of remote candidates, the only way I can realistically entertain the idea of hiring you is with an early, heavy emphasis on the Junior Development role. 

Ideally, you should be 21+, athletic, clean-cut, tidy, preferably no tattoos and piercings. A sense of adventure, optimism, sarcasm, imagination, cleverness, and laughter are quite necessary to get along with me. I'm latino, 6', 170… the closer you are to that, the better.

You should be analytical (able to analyze a problem you've never faced before without falling apart), and always with an eye toward solving a problem or finding someone who can. You should be tech savvy but environmentally aware, and love being out in nature. If you've taken computer science classes or have any special training in that area, that's a huge plus, as is having a Mac laptop. Having some experience either working, traveling independently, and/or living on your own, paying your own rent and bills, etc, certainly puts you ahead.


HOW TO APPLY

---END, THANK YOU FOR READING---","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;TLDR / SYNOPSIS: I&amp;#39;m a very unconventional bi software developer looking for a younger adventurous sidekick / assistant / protegé / fitness partner / travel buddy for a one-year, live-in, full-time, paid commitment. PROBLEM: I don&amp;#39;t know where to post such an ad or how to reach my target audience in Los Angeles. Because it&amp;#39;s an unusual job post, I&amp;#39;ve attempted to pre-empt as many questions possible with an unusually-detailed job post. I respect this is not a job/personals forum, so please keep comments to a critique of the ad. By all means, if you&amp;#39;re personally interested in the position, PM me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To restate, I&amp;#39;m looking for advice on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where to post / find viable candidates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Critique of the post itself. Apart from being along, is it clear? Did I miss anything obvious?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JOB DETAIL&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ABOUT MY WORK &amp;amp; ME — I&amp;#39;m a 42yo software developer. I design and build apps for small &amp;amp; medium-sized business. The apps are highly customized for each client and not sold publicly, so you&amp;#39;ve never heard of any of them. I&amp;#39;m self-taught, my skills are top-notch, and clients pay $60-$100 per hour for me to analyze their business, help them reduce overhead, and develop high-quality software with low maintenance costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I&amp;#39;m pretty poor at maintaining a healthy balance of work, health, money, friends, family, etc. When I&amp;#39;m working on a big project, I won&amp;#39;t eat or sleep right, won&amp;#39;t exercise, won&amp;#39;t call people back or think about anything until I&amp;#39;m satisified with my work. Having made and saved money, I&amp;#39;ll take a few months off, travel or spend a lot of quality time with my nephews (coaching them in football, takng them snowboarding, doing Boy Scout stuff, etc), until I start to run out of money, then find another project and do it over. It&amp;#39;s something of a bohemiam lifestyle, I&amp;#39;m my own boss and that&amp;#39;s great. But because I struggle to keep things in balance, it&amp;#39;s often a bumpy road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things are lining up well at the moment. I have a Junior Developer, as well as a former protegé I&amp;#39;m partnering with to take on bigger jobs. I see how they work better with their supportive girlfriends and wives. I&amp;#39;ve discovered I work best with a learnedly young man who can play an active role in helping me meet my goals, and also appreciates having a trustworthy mentor and friend from whom he can gain valuable insight and profitable skills. My overall goal is self-improvement, so I&amp;#39;m looking for a young man who wants to take that journey with me as well as play a supporting role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DUTIES&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PERSONAL ASSISTANT / JACK OF ALL TRADES — Perform standard tasks on a daily basis, such as responding to email, managing my calendar, organizing files, sending out bills to clients, reviewing proposals, setting up trainings, making travel arrangements, etc. You should start to get a sense of how I think and operate, and the more you can do without me, the more of my time I can bill to clients. Things we would do together would be producing tech video segments on YouTube as part of my geek training series. Or, if I want you to be an assistant coach with me for my 10yo nephew&amp;#39;s soccer league for six weeks, you should be up for it even if you have no coaching experience. Take guitar or language lessons with me? I&amp;#39;m looking for someone who is enthusiastic about doing anything he can to help me fulfill my goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FITNESS &amp;amp; NUTRITION — You and I get on the same workout plan aimed at muscle development, endurance and flexibility. We also come up with a nutrition plan and motivate each other to follow it, including vitamin and caloric awareness, sharing meals, etc. I enjoy cooking and eating healthy. I like long hikes (15+ miles), and long bike rides (40+ miles). I love camping, swimming, skydiving, most board sports, and generally like being active all the time. You should have a similar sense of adventure. It would be liberating to feel comfortable naked around each other since I was raised with the opposite idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JUNIOR SOFTWARE DEVELOPER — I could work with someone who did not have this skillset, but here&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s so valuable for both of us. A: Unlike with the other roles, this one generates income. Let&amp;#39;s say I pay you $10/h on a project, but I bill your time to the client at $20/h. You get paid to learn, the client pays way less for the same high-quality work that I supervise, I recover some costs, and it helps free my time so I can bill clients at my high rate — this way we&amp;#39;re both maximizing our earning power. B: I enjoy teaching and will teach you everything I know about software development. C: Your rate will be low at first, but after an immersive year training with me, you&amp;#39;ll be able to earn $30-$40/h on your own. D: The more meaningful involvement you have on my client projects, the more earning power you gain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OUR PERSONAL/WORKING RELATIONSHIP&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COMPANION / CONFIDANT — Apart from the more rational duties, you are, like me, a good listener. I have to trust you enough to introduce you to my family (nephews, grandmother, parents, etc). I think about a lot of things deeply, sometimes too much. I respond very well when prompted to stay focused in a positive and engaging way, and keeping me focused is a big part of your job. I often have warped estimations of time. And sometimes I just need a good kick in the pants to get something done. Spending a lot of time together, our relationship will be necessarily intense at times. Taking breaks from each other is important for our sanity, as is a sense of humor. If you can make me laugh and/or let me know you understand my point of view, you can help me through anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DEDICATION — I need someone who has TIME enough to take me on as a full-time project. If you&amp;#39;ve got a lot of school or are super busy and can&amp;#39;t make time for me or aren&amp;#39;t willing to travel, it won&amp;#39;t work. You must make my goals and priorities your own, and frankly make me first in your life for this one year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LIVING &amp;amp; TRAVELING — After we&amp;#39;ve established mutual trust, we can consider living together in Los Angeles. You would have your own room, and a third room is set aside as our office/work space. On the travel front, the plan is to spend about two months each in Peru, India and/or Colorado while working and exploring, maybe take some cooking classes and make some hot friends along the way. I&amp;#39;m often bashful, but the truth is I like being put in different social situations and meeting people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEX — Because I&amp;#39;m an older man attracted to younger men, I want to be clear about sexual attitudes and expectations. I like being adventurous at times. If we&amp;#39;re in Hawaii and I bring back two hot locals I met at the family beach who want to screw around, that can&amp;#39;t evoke jealousy or judgment from you. I&amp;#39;m not a big player, but this kind of horny &lt;em&gt;finds me&lt;/em&gt; from time to time and hell yeah I&amp;#39;m into it. If that kind of thing makes you uncomfortable, then we&amp;#39;re not a good match. I&amp;#39;m genuinely stoked for my friends when they&amp;#39;re getting laid; you should be too! Any sexual contact between you and I would have to be consensual and voluntary and safe, and never required or paid for. I won&amp;#39;t tolerate sex addiction, heavy drugs, barebacking strangers, lights-out parties, or any high-risk, reckless behavior. Your health &amp;amp; safety are actually incredibly important to me, as mine should be to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ROMANCE — Achieving my goals is far, far more important to me than finding true love (for now). If after our year together you can put up with me and we&amp;#39;re madly in love, lucky us. I like a good cuddle here and there, and it warms me up to have a younger bro fall asleep on my shoulder on planes and trains. But beyond that kind of thing I&amp;#39;d rather not complicate our relationship with the volatility or expectation of romance, let alone monogamy. I might have one or two flings in a year, but my goals and my relationship with you come first during our contract year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DISCRETION — This job is unique in that not only are you aiding me professionally, but also quite personally. I need to be able to trust you to use proper discretion when dealing with either. You can expect the same of me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PAY, BONUS, HOURS, TIMING&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a fair and honest living, and I&amp;#39;ll likewise expect you to share some costs like food and bills, as well as pay your own taxes. I don&amp;#39;t want to be your sugar daddy, so it&amp;#39;s important that you earn your own money and take this job seriously. Below is the pay structure. How quickly you move from one stage to the next depends on your usefulness, how many responsibilities you&amp;#39;re taking on, how much you help me increase my productivity, achieve focus and complete goals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Probation:
• Stage 0: No pay. Get to know each other over 1-2 wks via videochat or IRL; get on the same workout routine.
• Stage 1: $10/h, 10h/wk + 10h/wk free training. (Must move to Stage 2 by week 6 or sooner)
• Stage 2: $15/h, 20h/wk + 10h/wk free training. (Must move to Stage 3 by week 12 or sooner)

Contract:
• Stage 3: $20/h, 32h or more per week.
• Stage 4: $10K bonus (see below).
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BONUS — If you&amp;#39;ve stuck with me the entire year, and have helped me ahieve key goals, if you&amp;#39;ve been reliable and honest and done a terrific job, I will be happily offer a $10,000 bonus in escrow on condition of meeting milestones that will set out at the beginning of the contract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COMMITMENT &amp;amp; TIMING — Our time needs to be compressed to one year so as to stay focused on accomplishing goals. The right candidate likes pushing someone like me to his personal best, and sees this job as a springboard for better living. If we really are an amazing duo, we can go another year with bigger goals, we can discuss health &amp;amp; dental insurance, etc. But building mutual trust is obviously important before making any big moves, and that will take a little time. Together we&amp;#39;ll define our terms clearly and move forward with a healthy balance of caution and &lt;em&gt;carpe diem&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MY GOALS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are some (not all) of my top goals for the next year:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;• Get in peak physical shape (I recently had a severe shoulder injury and need to start therapy, and might even need surgery. I will need moral support since this injury is frustrating).
• Grow my business, earn US$10K+ every month (I do this some months, but it&amp;#39;s not usual); pay debts, save money. 
• Compete in a marathon and/or triathlon.
• Teach software development classes in foreign countries, show them how to find clients and maintain their business . while recruiting students to work for me as junior developers. Get to know fun, cute boys along the way.
• Greatly improve my guitar skills.
• Take classes: Nutrition, Industrial Electricity.
• Coach my nephews in one winning season of football soccer, or another sport.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ABOUT YOU&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For starters, you should already be in the the Los Angeles area, and have the interest and most critically the time to dedicate to everything I&amp;#39;ve written about. In terms of remote candidates, the only way I can realistically entertain the idea of hiring you is with an early, heavy emphasis on the Junior Development role. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally, you should be 21+, athletic, clean-cut, tidy, preferably no tattoos and piercings. A sense of adventure, optimism, sarcasm, imagination, cleverness, and laughter are quite necessary to get along with me. I&amp;#39;m latino, 6&amp;#39;, 170… the closer you are to that, the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should be analytical (able to analyze a problem you&amp;#39;ve never faced before without falling apart), and always with an eye toward solving a problem or finding someone who can. You should be tech savvy but environmentally aware, and love being out in nature. If you&amp;#39;ve taken computer science classes or have any special training in that area, that&amp;#39;s a huge plus, as is having a Mac laptop. Having some experience either working, traveling independently, and/or living on your own, paying your own rent and bills, etc, certainly puts you ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOW TO APPLY&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Submit a reply, including the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;• Indicate that you&amp;#39;ve read the job post completely.
• Write a paragraph about yourself (include where you grew up, where you live now, personal hobbies, etc).
• Write a paragraph explaining what about this job appeals to you, and why you&amp;#39;re a compelling candidate.
• Name 3 big goals you&amp;#39;d like accomplish for yourself in one year.
• Stats (height, weight)
• Face picture (optional)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
