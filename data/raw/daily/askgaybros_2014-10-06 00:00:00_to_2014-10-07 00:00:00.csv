I decided that seeking out student counseling would be a good idea and will be setting up an appointment when the building opens up today.

However cutting out the toxic people in my life may be a bit more difficult. My Ex not only goes to my college but also lives in my building and shares many of my friends. Also, my father is a huge source of stress on me and the only way I'm able to take out student loans is if I get him to sign. But I've gotten to the point of which I can't handle a single conversation with him anymore. Just thinking about him right now is giving me pretty bad anxiety, actually.

The only way I'd be able to cut them both out is if I live off campus, but not at home. Living off campus would reduce my encounters with my Ex. It would also reduce the amount of loans I'd need to take out which would negate, and possibly completely cut my last reliance on my father. I can still rely on my mother if I ever needed some slight financial assistance anyways. Not to mention I won't live at home were a lot of toxic people from my past live...

**So my question to you guys:
I'd like to start living on my own by about July, how can I make this happen?** I understand I'd need a job and an apartment, but does anyone have any tips on how to start living independently? IE, roommates tips, budgeting, jobs i should be looking for, apartment search tips, or anything else you wish someone had told you when you started off on your own?

I don't have a car and I'd like to remain by my school. I go to school out of state and would rather stay here then return to my homestate for the summer. I suppose I could save all year and then use my saved money over the summer for a 3month lease while continuing to work and then return to the dorms here, but I'd rather not.

The conversation got a bit heated, and he said some things that were very blunt. Said that I lack all understanding of boundaries. Said that I need to worry about myself more and not worry about how he's feeling every day. Told me he'd dread getting a text from me.

My last boyfriend of 2 years did the same sorts of the thing the entire time we were dating. Just would say things like ""You're really self-centered."" ""You're too emotional."" ""Everything's always about you.""

I just never have an impulse to say these sorts of critical things. Like, I don't necessarily believe they're all true. I probably am too emotional, because I'm fairly anxious all the time. But I think the others are more perspective things. But in a relationship, I don't have anything bad to say about the guy I'm dating. Like I might say ""I'm uncomfortable when you make fun of me all the time."" But like even that statement, I'd qualify with something like ""I know you're just trying to be lighthearted, and I'm not trying to control you, but......"" But I'm still fairly happy with them, still think they're good people, still value them.... Thoughts like ""You're a self-centered bitch"" and ""Talking to you is a waste of my time."" never cross my mind. It's not even that I'm censoring them. I just never have the thought... So.. This is the second time now that a guy I've like has started to think I'm trash, and told me about it, and I'm sitting here still thinking, ""Okay. I certainly don't want to date you anymore, but you're a cool guy. Do your thing, and if you don't want me to be a part of it, I don't really want to be around anyway.""

I'm just worried I'm socially inept or something. I'm afraid I'm going to keep dating cool guys who will eventually hate me, and that's a terrifying thought, because I legitimately believe they're awesome people, and I lack the ability to aggress like a normal person. I can only imagine breaking up with someone because the spark is gone or they cheated or we're heading in different directions in life. I've never thought anything bad about their character, but apparently everyone else has those thoughts. 

I'm very conflict-avoidant, and I just feel that until I can date someone and tell him ""here's what I don't like about you"" that I'm just living in my own little dreamworld or something...And probably the bigger problem is that I always end up feeling like I screwed everything up, because they have these horrible things to say about me, and I don't have anything to say back. What did I do to make these cool people see me like *that*?

**TL;DR: Both of my exes have felt comfortable telling me what they don't like about me, and it never crosses my mind to do the same. I feel like my conflict-avoidant personality is making me too agreeable to be in a realistic relationship. Being the only one to hear why I suck tends to leave me feeling like the relationship problems are entirely my fault.... Because I don't have any similar complaints.**

So I try your pearls of wisdom tonight with something that has been bothering me.  

I've always been meh physically--perfectly under the radar, until I was so far under the radar that no one wanted to look twice at me.  Basketball and tennis are the sports I love, and I can still knock down the occasional jumpshot but I refuse to play casually (athlete mentality?  idk--I can still hear my old coaches yelling at how embarrassing I was).  

I guess this is the part where I admit I have body issues (sigh).  My parents were always ambivalent or negative on my physical appearance.  Now that I'm in college (and working in athletics), I'm finding more than ever how fat I seem to be.  I always rejected the premise that I was overweight/out-of-shape, largely because I have a strong mentality (maybe so strong I freely admit I'm making excuses for not doing the things I should be doing to my body?).  More of my bosses in athletics seem to be commenting on my weight unprovoked, and not in the good way.  Stop eating XYZ, lose some weight, go for a run, go lift, etc.  

I've only been to a gym a handful of times in my life, and those times were all because a guy stopped talking to me over Tinder (this is where we laugh), and I was so mad I assumed it was because I was fat.  Anger fueled me for maybe a week, and it was good, but I freely walked away and made up excuses along the way, and I've never felt/looked healthy ever since.  Part of my problem was that I did not know what I was doing on the exercise machines.  I asked a worker at the gym how the machines worked, and they flew through quick explanations, and it was disheartening to look at a machine and walk away because I did not know how to use it.  

So what am I asking?  

TL;DR: **Understanding that rational economic actors think at the margin, what are some steps at the margin that I can take with exercise and eating that will eventually lead to a healthier lifestyle, assuming that nothing has been done right now?**

He said (I'm paraphrasing) that it would be nice if we could have 'casually' gay men and have it not be a big deal.

I said this in response.

&gt;I think the problem with making homosexuality a minor detail (moreso in showing gay men than gay women as Ross and Ingoo brought up), is that if it plays almost no part in the story, a conservative producer or even a producer who doesn't want to shy people away, is so interchangeable with men depicted as heterosexual that the producers will either downplay it or change it. And when you're considering the action genre, where the majority of the consuming demographic is men, it's hard to address the idea or theme of diversity so that depiction can be sidelined.

But now, I'm wondering if I wasn't mistaken in that belief and we should have homosexuality or transitioning between genders become a non-issue. I'm confused as whether or not that the narrative or story should address homosexuality and other issues of diversity or simply not discuss it. I've played a lot of Bioware games, The Sims and know that Saint's Row that changing one's gender/race/sexuality doesn't really get addressed (other than some romantic options) and not really talked about. To me, since the idea that race and gender and sexuality are so interchangeable for a player character and doesn't change their role in the story (A Gay Shepard will still shoot their way to victory as a straight Shepard would), those themes of diversity are non-issues to me.

I also stumbled upon [this quote from Tumblr](http://greenwolfmusic.tumblr.com/post/55263325859/so-i-want-to-introduce-you-to-two-characters-on)

&gt;That having been said, these characters (Claire Augustus from Questionable Content and Alysia Yeoh from Batgirl, two male to female transgender portrayals) do frustrate me a little. While on the one hand they represent very character driven portrayals, I'm concerned with how insignificant their genders are to their stories as a whole. Both authors use ""coming out"" as a trope to solidify the friendship between the protagonist and the trans side character. However, beyond this, these characters' trans status is not used for any other sort of development. These characters could very easily be replaced by cis characters without dramatically affecting the narrative of the stories they appear in.

Other times, I've heard the criticism that the homosexual aspect of one's character, such as Steve Cortez from Mass Effect, is 'shoehorned in' and isn't part of the character. Other times, I fall under 'if it serves a purpose in the story, it's okay' aspect.

For example in Scandal (I just started watching. I only finished the first episode), Olivia defends her client who happens to be gay, and such showing footage that he was with another gay man would release him from suspicion of murder. However, the client doesn't want to come out the closet since he is a soldier and is part of a conservative community. Olivia eventually relates to him, saying who he loves shouldn't be a secret (and also relates to Olivia's own affairs with the President of the United States). In Paranorman, the issues of Aggie being persecuted from a New England's conforming society eventually plays into the theme that even different or strange people should be accepted (and thus adds to the humor at the revelation that Mitch was gay).

What are your thoughts on all of this?
","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was something that Ross Lincoln from Escapist Magazine said during the movie Podcast. He said (I&amp;#39;m paraphrasing) that it would be nice if we could have &amp;#39;casually&amp;#39; gay men and have it not be a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;

So last time I posted about a guy that liked and I wanted to know about the best way to approach him... Short story is I did! Sorta... 
lemme explain.

So, I posted my last post on a friday, and I wanted to ask him out the next time I saw him, which would have been a Tuesday. Even though I was so nervous I physically had a stomach ache I knew it was something i HAD to do. So I go ino class, and I had my whole plan sorted out and... he isn't there. So I texted him asking what was up. Maybe he was sick or something. NOPE! He dropped his program. With no way to actually meet him in person without being creepy, I just asked him out through phone... This was all on Tuesday.

I waited for a reply until Saturday when I couldn't take the anticipation. Everything was going through my mind, every possibility, and I was being truly pessimistic. I thought he didn't like me at all, and wanted to give up. However, against my nature I continued to wait. Saturday I just asked him if he was ok since its been so long since I heard from him. He texted back right away saying that his phone is messed up and that he did reply right away, but that his phone didnt send the reply. He said he did want to go.

Obviously, I'm super excited and ask him where or when he wanted to meet up. I don't know the area he lives in so I wanted to know a general location to make some plans. Doesn't reply... It's only been a day and I've already texted him saying that if he did reply, I didn't get it and that if it still doesn't work he can try through facebook or something.

So the question is, can I do anything after this? I don't want to seem naggy, or clingy. Maybe I'm just too excited, I dunno. Do I continue to ask him about it, or should I remain patient and just wait for a response? This is the first time I'm pursuing a guy I like, and I'm no good at dating so I'm clueless...

tl;dr: I'm inexperienced at dating. I asked him out via text, he said yes, I asked when and where, he didn't respond. He said that his phone is buggy and sometimes doesn't send texts. I replied saying I didn't get anything so he could try again or use facebook. Still got nothing. What should I do?
