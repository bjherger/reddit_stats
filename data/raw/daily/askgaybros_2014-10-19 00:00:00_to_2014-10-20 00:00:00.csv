Well three days ago, the awesome guy I've been talking to and I finally met. He picked me up outside of where I was staying, got out of his car, and we both hugged. 
The next hour was full of nothing but nervous giggling and excitement. My first impression was that he was even cuter in person.
We spent the entire weekend exploring his home city, meeting his best friends, and making up for 5 months of not being close to each other. Last night he stayed with me and we drank beer, ate pizza and played video games. I loved every second of it. He asked me to officially be his boyfriend too. Of course I said ""hell yes"".

I am 26, and I currently live in the SF Bay Area, what is widely considered to be the ""gay mecca."" However, despite this, I have never found any meaningful connections with other gay men beyond casual acquaintances or friends (meaning no one I hang out with on a regular basis or go out to clubs with). I do not have a group of gay friends to go out with, I do not live in SF proper, I live at home (since I am under dire financial constraints) and I work two jobs after graduating from law school. 

I use apps (Grindr, Tinder, Scruff) to try and meet other men but I overwhelmingly feel defeated, frustrated and lonely. It's doubly frustrating since my friends (who are mostly straight people) do not seem to understand that just because I live in and around an area with a lot of gay people doesn't necessarily mean I will meet any. However, a large part of me cannot help but feel like I am doing something wrong or ""unworthy"" making meaningful connections either by way of friendships or relationships (I have never dated). I have tried being more involved with gay people in a non-club, non-sexual setting (eg. doing pro-bono legal work, local professional groups, etc), but it all seems so hard to fit into the pre-existing cliques. 

I am wondering if anyone has found it difficult to try and meet other guys in metropolitan areas NOT for sex (although meeting guys for sex is also a seemingly insurmountable obstacle since I haven't been intimate with anyone in over 5 months...). I feel like there's so much pressure that I put on myself to make friends, enjoy my youth and date and be normal. But I end up feeling so alone most of the time, it's depressing. Any advice is greatly appreciated...thanks!

Might be over-sharing a bit; trying to give context so let me know if I need to trim it down. 

Basically had suspicions that I might be depressed for a long time now, partially related to sexuality but not a singular issue.

Been doing it for a few months and has been alright, talking to a real person about some stuff is nice since I like to bottle up everything always from everyone. 

Been going through a period again (today included) where I can't get anything done. I just lay in bed feeling exhausted / falling asleep and just feeling really shitty. After sort of mentioning this to my counselor a few sessions ago, they asked if I had considered Depression as a possibility (in the roundabout way they do, so they aren't impressing anything on me) and let me know options if I want, were going to a doctor for diagnosis. I didn't really say much because not sure if I am, and don't want to deal with being depressed on top of everything else, not really comfortable with psychotropic medication and also not sure how I would hide all that from family / friends (no one knows about the counselling / and obviously no one knows about sexuality because can't support myself and not ready to be disowned anyway).

&lt;p&gt;The problem with that, however, is that my roommate is in the way. The issue is that my roommate is a hermit that doesn&amp;#39;t have a lot of friends or places to go to. So he always ends up in the same place playing video games on his laptop...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I was looking for any advice or ideas with my situation. Thanks~&lt;/p&gt;

I'll keep this short and sweet; I'm a longtime user of this sub, and I'm using a throwaway cuz he knows I spend a lot of time here, and I don't want this post showing up on my history.

Anyhow, me and the bf have entered the 4th year together.
It's the first LTR for both of us, he used to play around a lot before he met me, and I had been burned by a couple of failed relationships which had made me extremely cautious when I started dating him.

These past few years have been so intense, but we stayed each other's safety net, and in the end it all seemed to work out.

I've been going to therapy for a year and a half, and it made me come to terms with a lot of stuff that was weighing me down.
Now I'm a happier, healthier and more centered person; my guy, on the other hand, is slowly unraveling.

He's finishing a 3-year uni course in 6 years, has gained a lot of weight and spends most of his time on a message board devoted to a specific interest of his.

There is no need to be a shrink to see he's escaping reality, a reality that is profoundly frustrating, and I have been acting as his anchor to bring him back to planet Earth.

The thing is...being with a person who's struggling with depression is exhausting; I'm allowing myself to make this about me because I never do it IRL.
I too have suffered from this, and I know how it all goes down...but I also know that he's the one who wants to get better.

He's been going to a therapist for the past year, but I'm afraid it's not helping; my guess is that she's not the right person to get through to him, but him being the sweet boy he always is, he's takes it for what it is.

That's my main problem with my bf: he is defeated. 
He refuses to believe he can have a better body, or that he will graduate...it's just slowly eating him up inside, and I can't do anything about it.

I'm trying to be there for him all the time, I've just started a new job but as soon as I'm out of there I'm rushing back to his place with something that might cheer him up, so he can see he's been on my mind all day.

...there's also a guy that has been messaging me on FB for the past month; 
he lives 5000 miles from here so I'm never going to do anything with him (and even if he lived next door, I'm not about that deadbeat life), but I gotta tell you bros, feeling *desired*, getting a little compliment here and there...it's been so good.
He knows where I stand and we have both agreed to keep it on a friendly, sometimes flirty level - but *nothing is ever going to happen*.

Both the bf and this guy know of each other, as I don't like to keep secrets. They are okay with it, as they know what each means to me. 
My guy has a (more platonic) online pal, so he never objected. 
You don't need me to tell you that things have been...uneventful in bed, and even though I still find him attractive, he can't bring himself to be intimate with me, cuz of his recent body image issues. 

I think he could make an effort to look good regardless of his weight, but this is a more complex problem...but it would be nice to see him looking nice (wouldn't go as far as adding 'for me'!).

I know he loves me more than everything, the guy basically worships me, and he's literally my other half...but this has been so tough on me.
I would love to see him a little more independent and ambitious; I've known since day #1 that he's a socially-awkward goofball, and I still went for it - that's not the issue. 

It breaks my heart to see the most amazing person I know slowly burning out.

WOW! I guess I *really* needed to vent. 
Sorry for the wall of text, if you have any input I would *love* to hear it!

My boyfriend and I have been together about a year now, and things have been great.  This is probably the most substantial relationship either of us have had been in and he is someone who I have grown to trust and care about.  

Though, not too long ago, I was using his computer while he was out.  I had known that he was chatting with other guys (platonicly) for fun on facebook, and it honestly did not bother me.  That level of harmless flirting was on the same level of watching porn, so long as nothing would come from it.  Knowing this, I went through his browsing history to assure myself that nothing was getting too out of hand.  

I realize this was the wrong thing to do, but I discovered he has been using craigslist to respond to and create postings in the m4m section.  Also, i found out that he has a second email address I had not known about.  this account was left logged in, and his email account showed no messages in his inbox, but the sent mail was still all there.  Full of naked pictures and typical hookup chat.  

I couldn't tell if he had actually hooked up with anyone, but the messages were concerning enough to make me wonder.  
Please, I know that I violated his privacy by snooping; that is wrong.  But I'm really concerned about what I found and what this means.

How can I confront him about this?  Should i come clean and tell him what i did, and confront him about his actions?  Has anyone been in a similar situation?  Any input on this is appreciated.  Thanks.

UPDATE:  Thanks you all so much for the input and perspectives.  I told him that I knew about what was happening and asked him if he was cheating.  He immediately came clean about it, but swears he hasn't hooked up with anyone, and said its a way to get off when he's bored.  Obviously, I know that he could easily be lying about it.  Even if he is not, this behavior makes pulling the trigger on cheating so much easier to do.

I know it will probably irritate people, but I don't plan on leaving him, and I really do believe that he wants to stay with me as well.  I've made it very clear that I am not okay with his actions, and that I will much more cautious about our level of mutual trust.  I do believe that truly fulfilling relationships require work, compromise, and the ability to work through problems like these.  this is the first time something like this has happened, and so long as he entirely stops I don't see why this should be a problem in the future.

   I went to travel to meet up with this kid about an hr and a half away from my house.  He name is Kyle. Kyle is a nice kid but when we met he looked alot younger than he said he was.  But I continued with the date he planned for me. 


   While driving to kyle I opened up grindr just to see how many hit I can get while driving through these new towns lol. By the time I get in front of his house he told me he needed 10 mins so i looked at the account and started talking to this one guy named Anthony. 


   I told him I came to visit because im meeting someone for a date. We spoke for 5 mins and I had to go.


   We went on a date... this is the kid that wanted to give me his $300 gold necklace. To basically claim me. I wouldn't take it but he insisted I wear it on the date. He introduced me to his best friend that took me up to a cliff with the most amazing view and already had a picnic set up. It was nice. 


   During the date we started to slighly argue. I realized things weren't going to work. For many reasons. I told him,  he was happy and wants to keep in touch with me because he sees me as a big brother now since I dont want anything from the relationship.  We said our goodbyes and I started driving off.


   The kid Anthony messaged me and I said im traveling back home. I said the date didnt go well. He than said come get coffee with me since you have to pass my town anyways.  I accepted.  He gave me an address and it took me into a ghetto place. Apparently my gps does auto check so took me to the wrong place. He than asked me are you a fake profile?  Because we thought we both were stringing each other along.


   Anthony came up with a second idea of grabbing pizza which was 15 mins away for both of us. I drove there and when I pulled up I see the most beautiful guy standing by his BMW waiting for someone to come. I didn't think this was the guy because in person he looked so different.  I came out my car he smiled and I walked to him.


   We hung out at the pizzeria for 3 hrs. Had a great time. He told me he's glad we met. I did the same. We told eachother we thought we were lying to eachother.  It was a nice not planned time with Anthony. 


   At the end, he hugged me goodbye. Said he had a great time and we should do it again.  I walked back into my car pulled out and he waved at me.


   When I got home, he left me a message on the app saying it was nice meeting and glad we met. Hopefully soon we can do it again. 


   Next day we spoke on grindr again. I asked for his number he gave it to me. This is where things ger strange... I put it into my phone and when I texted it said sent failed. I dialed the wrong number. So I redid the correct number and no response.  However the number with the extra number answered and said what's up.


   Later that evening I messaged him on grindr saying I text you and two seconds later. On the failed number someone wrote I messaged you back.

   So basically I am confused about the number thing. Kind of embarrassed to bring it up again and wondering how can I bring it up. 

   Im sensing he lost interest because my last message I showed him a view of my job off the roof and he just wrote beautiful.  Nothing more.

   I feel if he's interested he would text me. I feel he possibly lost interest because of so many malfunctions. 

   I need your guys help with this... how can I bring it up again without sounding dumb about the number. 

   He told me to watch this movie too btw. All I was able to watch was half. But tonight I will watch the other half. So I was thinking I should wait until tonight after the movie send him a messaged about what I thought of it and see if I can spark up the conversation again. 

We both had a good time, thought it was funny how it didnt work with the other guy but here we are laughing right now and enjoying the company.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to tell the story of how I met this guy im about to write about...&lt;/p&gt;

I told him,  he was happy and wants to keep in touch with me because he sees me as a big brother now since I dont want anything from the relationship.  We said our goodbyes and I started driving off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kid Anthony messaged me and I said im traveling back home. I said the date didnt go well. He than said come get coffee with me since you have to pass my town anyways.  I accepted.  He gave me an address and it took me into a ghetto place. Apparently my gps does auto check so took me to the wrong place. He than asked me are you a fake profile?  Because we thought we both were stringing each other along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anthony came up with a second idea of grabbing pizza which was 15 mins away for both of us. I drove there and when I pulled up I see the most beautiful guy standing by his BMW waiting for someone to come. I didn&amp;#39;t think this was the guy because in person he looked so different.  I came out my car he smiled and I walked to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hung out at the pizzeria for 3 hrs. Had a great time. He told me he&amp;#39;s glad we met. I did the same. We told eachother we thought we were lying to eachother.  It was a nice not planned time with Anthony. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end, he hugged me goodbye. Said he had a great time and we should do it again.  I walked back into my car pulled out and he waved at me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I got home, he left me a message on the app saying it was nice meeting and glad we met. Hopefully soon we can do it again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next day we spoke on grindr again. I asked for his number he gave it to me. This is where things ger strange... I put it into my phone and when I texted it said sent failed. I dialed the wrong number. So I redid the correct number and no response.  However the number with the extra number answered and said what&amp;#39;s up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later that evening I messaged him on grindr saying I text you and two seconds later. On the failed number someone wrote I messaged you back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So basically I am confused about the number thing. Kind of embarrassed to bring it up again and wondering how can I bring it up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Im sensing he lost interest because my last message I showed him a view of my job off the roof and he just wrote beautiful.  Nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel if he&amp;#39;s interested he would text me. I feel he possibly lost interest because of so many malfunctions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need your guys help with this... how can I bring it up again without sounding dumb about the number. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He told me to watch this movie too btw. All I was able to watch was half. But tonight I will watch the other half. So I was thinking I should wait until tonight after the movie send him a messaged about what I thought of it and see if I can spark up the conversation again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We both had a good time, thought it was funny how it didnt work with the other guy but here we are laughing right now and enjoying the company.&lt;/p&gt;

Basically the last week or two I've been really, really horny and normaly I wouldn't mind and just wank or whatever, but I've also started precumming a lot, like leak through my boxers and leave wet spots on my clothes. Any solutions for that? It's fine when I'm horny but after it's pretty gross and I don't want to be washing my jeans daily.

To give idea of the change I went from wanking every day or two to easily wanking two or three times a day.

I'm single at the moment so no help there. 

Also, other problem: I have the place to myself for the next week and I'm worried I'll end up doing something stupid. I don't really like random sex, I always feel kinda, worthless I guess, after (don't judge others for it though.) and I'm kinda worried i'll end up meeting with someone for sex because when I'm horny it seems like a great idea even though I know how I feel after, getting off seems a helluva lot more important. Any advice for that either?

I feel kinda stupid asking and I swear to god I'm not lying or making this up or anything.
I'm 24 if that makes a difference with like hormones or something.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok I have a weird problem that&amp;#39;s kinda embarrassing.&lt;/p&gt;
