I wasn't raped, but I know what happened to me wasn't right. Freshman year of college I went to visit a friend from high school at his new college. I had a crush on him, but he always proclaimed he was straight so I let it go of course despite when we were alone together he would always get...pretty affectionate and gay with me. I chalked it up to him feeling safe around me that he didn't feel the need to put up some facade to maintain his gender performance. I eventually got over the crush and he was just my straight best friend.  
  
So I visit him and it's fun. He shows me around his college town and we go out to eat and eventually drink with some of his friends. I'm very new to alcohol so I don't know my limits entirely and he starts babysitting me. Eventually, it's nighttime and he lets me sleep on his bed. He's on the floor. I'm still very drunk and while I drift off to sleep he climbs onto his bed and is on top of me. He's almost a foot taller than me and although not some athlete my skinny ass is nothing compared to his weight.  
  
He kisses me, starts taking my clothes off. I'm a virgin and not comfortable. I'm saying no, no, no. I don't want to. But he won't stop. I can feel his dick rubbing up against me. It's big, which scares me. He could hurt me. But I'm hard at the same time and he notices. He tells me he's never seen a guy precum so much. So he has been fucking guys.  
  
I'm confused by my hardon. I'm confused by my precum. But I know I don't want this. I can't push him off as much as I try to. He's too heavy for me to get off. I give in. I can't do anything. I can't go anywhere. Eventually I just try to make him cum as fast as he can so he can go to sleep and stop. He lasts so long...I could see the digital clock from the bed. He doesn't cum for an hour. I'm in pain. I don't know how to relax as a bottom and I just want to get it over with.  
  
The next day I left as planned. He hugs me goodbye. By the time I get back to my college town he's deleted me from social media. He will not text me back. I don't know why I even want to text him or talk to him. He hasn't spoken to me since.  
  
I don't think I was raped. I gave in. I didn't scream like I could have. He had suitemates but his own room. I blame myself for that. If I was really being raped then I would have done something, no? The next day his roommates say to us ""someone got lucky last night"" and are winking at us. I just smile awkwardly.  
  
This has been therapeutic writing it all out. I honestly stopped thinking about it since it happened, but we are reading the book Push in one of my classes and during the scene when Precious is molested, I just couldn't stop thinking about what happened to me. I never considered it assault or rape. I didn't know what to call it. I read the scene and started crying, but not because of what was going on in the novel. I was thinking about what happened to me for the first time in years and realized that it may have had more of an affect on my relationships and love life than I thought. I don't know where to go from here or what I can even do now. But just writing this has been helpful.

It's been a tough couple of days in my mind, and anything that can help me see a bit more clearly.

Me and my boyfriend of almost three years have just recently started doing long-distance (I'm on the West Coast; he's in New York). Until the end of the summer, we lived together in New York for about a year and a half, and I'm currently missing him immensely. We talk pretty much every day, but there isn't really an end date for the long distance phase of our relationship. I just started a 3-year professional degree, and he is in school, two years away from graduating. He was born and raised in NYC, his parents and family are all still there, and he has a great life with a lot of opportunity ahead of him. My situation is a bit more... complicated. I have a not-great family situation (i.e. they're all homophobes and I need my distance), which is part of what motivated me to move out West. I also hated (like realllllllly hated) living in NYC, being a small-town kid and all. 

The main issue is... I don't see myself ever being happy living in NY, and I don't see him being happy anywhere but there. I'm aware that something's gotta give eventually, and I'm trying to figure out how to bring this concern up. Lately I've been feeling like if we aren't able to come up with a resolution that has us in the same place in a reasonable amount of time, we should start giving each other the chance to move on. Which is the most painful thing to think about... but also, I'm not getting younger, and we're at the stage where I think we either get married or break up on amicable terms. 

Anyways, so, how should I go about bringing this up to him? I don't want him to think that I am just trying to find a way to break up with him, but I also don't want to force him to give up his life and his home to be with me. Usually we can talk about anything... but this topic leaves me particularly nervous... Help? :(","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance for any advice about this. It&amp;#39;s been a tough couple of days in my mind, and anything that can help me see a bit more clearly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me and my boyfriend of almost three years have just recently started doing long-distance (I&amp;#39;m on the West Coast; he&amp;#39;s in New York). Until the end of the summer, we lived together in New York for about a year and a half, and I&amp;#39;m currently missing him immensely. We talk pretty much every day, but there isn&amp;#39;t really an end date for the long distance phase of our relationship. I just started a 3-year professional degree, and he is in school, two years away from graduating. He was born and raised in NYC, his parents and family are all still there, and he has a great life with a lot of opportunity ahead of him. My situation is a bit more... complicated. I have a not-great family situation (i.e. they&amp;#39;re all homophobes and I need my distance), which is part of what motivated me to move out West. I also hated (like realllllllly hated) living in NYC, being a small-town kid and all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main issue is... I don&amp;#39;t see myself ever being happy living in NY, and I don&amp;#39;t see him being happy anywhere but there. I&amp;#39;m aware that something&amp;#39;s gotta give eventually, and I&amp;#39;m trying to figure out how to bring this concern up. Lately I&amp;#39;ve been feeling like if we aren&amp;#39;t able to come up with a resolution that has us in the same place in a reasonable amount of time, we should start giving each other the chance to move on. Which is the most painful thing to think about... but also, I&amp;#39;m not getting younger, and we&amp;#39;re at the stage where I think we either get married or break up on amicable terms. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, so, how should I go about bringing this up to him? I don&amp;#39;t want him to think that I am just trying to find a way to break up with him, but I also don&amp;#39;t want to force him to give up his life and his home to be with me. Usually we can talk about anything... but this topic leaves me particularly nervous... Help? :(&lt;/p&gt;

And now I'm starting to look at guys with not necessarily sculpted muscles but not bulky bear muscles. Like an in between.

I've tried not to indicate which side I'm on, but if you feel I've failed on that front, just let me know.

If someone states ""I will throw some laundry in when I get home"" - 

Do you believe this means:
a) They will put some laundry in the washer, but not dry and fold it.
b) They will put some laundry in the washer, then dry and fold it.
c) They will do all 6 loads of laundry that needs to be done, including drying and folding.
d) Seriously?  Is this really a fucking question?

Additionally, should the person putting laundry in assume the other person is completely out of work clothes and some need to be washed for them, or is that the responsibility of the non-laundry doer to explicitly tell the laundry doer to make sure some of them are thrown in?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, gaybros, I come to you with a simple request - settle this stupid argument for us.
