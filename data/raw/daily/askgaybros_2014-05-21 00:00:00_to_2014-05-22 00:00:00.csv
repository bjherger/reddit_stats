-----

It feels like I'm looking at the same people over and over on OkCupid. Unlike Grindr (a whole other ballgame), OkCupid ostensibly serves as a tool used to find friends and relationships. And yet every month or so I find it perplexing to see the same faces pop up with a different picture, a new description, a re-worded self-summary that reads like a narcissist's daydream. I message the people I find attractive and typically get no response. Yet I see them months later still looking, still searching.

After being out for over a year and a half, slowly immersing myself into gay culture, lifestyles, etc. I find the abuse of online dating (whatever you want to call it) somewhat perplexing. Past generations of gay people would kill for the advantages we have today. We have freedoms they never got to experience in their youth. We live in a country slowly, but surely progressing towards a more tolerant, equal world. We have technological devices they've never dreamed of. There's an app that will show you the nearest gay person in a hundred mile radius, for fuck's sake (literally and figuratively.)

So why is it so hard for young gay people to connect with one another? Are we all just immature, horny dickheads? I feel as if we've never been more connected, yet so totally isolated from one another (yes, I'm fully aware of how this is a metaphor for what society has become as a result of the internet.) Why is it that I see the same faces on OkCupid? What are we waiting for? Yet as I ask this, I came to a realization. A shitty realization, but one that nonetheless might answer my dilemma.

I do the same thing. You see, there's plenty of people that message me, and I pull the same shit. I give them the cold shoulder. Sometimes it's for good reasons (""I don't think that's gonna work out""), shallow reasons (""Our interests are pretty similar but I don't think he's attractive"") or selfish reasons (""He looks good, but I'll keep him on the back burner until I find somebody better."") But the point is that I'm part of the problem. I give them the cold shoulder, just like the people I've messaged, the ones still on OkCupid (and even Grindr), changing the minutiae of their profile every week in hopes that adding a new selfie will radically alter their lives.

I understand it takes a while to find somebody you really care about, but why can't we just accept flaws for what they are? Why can't I break the cycle and respond to somebody who seems nice, but who I dismiss as ""beneath me"" because, full disclosure, I can be a real prick sometimes. I'm just as bad, if not worse than the people I was dismissing earlier. Everyone just seems to be chasing their own tails, myself included.

But you know what? I don't want to be that way. I'm never going to achieve any kind of happiness or enlightenment by being that way. I'm gonna be alone for the rest of my life if I continue to be an ass hole. So I messaged that person back today - the guy who I initially dismissed - and I'm gonna meet him for a drink this weekend. We'll see how it goes. I'm excited. You know why? Because I'm sick of waiting for something to happen, and ultimately ending up with nothing.

At the end of the day, we all want somebody to love and connect with. It's human nature. I guess my point is - what's wrong with us? Why can't we achieve any of this with all of the great, amazing shit that we have? Am I alone in admitting I'm flawed? Is this just my problem? Is it yours as well?

There are entire subreddits dedicated to gay subculture. We should all be happy. Yet we just keep falling on our own stupid faces, constantly fucking up, unable to accept our own faults and other people's faults because we want something more. I anticipate getting some feedback about how the gay community is warm and accepting and loving and blah blah blah. That's true. But it doesn't mean people are the same way. I've seen and met enough people in the gay community to know that some (not all) can be shallow, judgmental ass holes. And that's not me projecting. Take a closer look at OkCupid, or Grindr, or any other app, or walk into any gay bar late at night. Ask them if they've ever found a real connection.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;FULL DISCLOSURE: This quasi-essay is written from the perspective of a sleep-deprived 22 year old in search of a relationship, because hooking up with guys on Grindr loses its charm after a while.

For context, we're in high school but I'm graduating, we formally 'met' each other when paired up for a project, and ever since then I felt that fuzzy feeling you get when you like someone...which has been a while lol. Even though I'm trying to be as objective as possible, and keep those emotions in control, it's safe to say that I got a crush on him. Which is weird because I never paid attention to him the whole year and didn't even think he was that attractive but now I seriously think he's not only hot but his personality is pretty damn charming as well. I'm a closet bi by the way, and do not emit high gaydar waves to warrant people suspecting anything unless in close contact. He straight for all I know.

The confusing parts are how since we sat next to each other...we got to know each other very quickly. Almost too quickly in my view. Let's mention how I'm not exactly shy, but I rarely take initiative in a friendship/relationship unless it's something clearly established (and therefore feels organic and not trivial?). So he would be the type to ask questions about me (music, working out, activities, blah blah), and I would give genuine honest answers and we'd go back and forth from there.

But then I noticed weird things. Asking me if I worked out? Would ask me to flex and would feel my biceps. Tap my other muscles around my body and make jokes on my 'atrophy' lol. Joke about my farmer tan. Asked me about my music? Would ask to go through my iPod, comment on my 'bad music taste', delete songs that were bad, and everyday split a headphone with me and listen to HIS music and talk about it (more on this later). All...seemingly innocent things guys do, and I've had a decent amount of perspective to both male and female friendships, platonic or not.

This could be my brain fooling me now, but it would seem almost as if he was flirting. And I tried hard not to reciprocate but it's like some things I do without thinking, but in subtle ways. Lots of eye contact? Yup. He observes things about me (my patterns and habits) and comments on them. I walk out of class? We walk together and go far, even past our destinations. One time we literally were just following each other and assumed the other was taking us somewhere. We don't talk outside of class but LOTS of times when I walk past him and ignore him or don't see him, he will call out my name to make me notice him.

So the big crazy part is when he asked me if I was gay. And it just snowballed from there with his suspicions, telling me he's suspected since he sat next to me (why didn't he ask me at that moment then??), telling me he's very open minded and wants me to 'let it out' and come out to him blah blah. We live in a homophobic place. I just kept telling him no nicely, even though obviously deep down I know what I am. I just don't know his motives. He told me I should tell him 'sooner than later' when I cynically told him that when I graduate I won't see anyone anymore so his questions and my answers were irrelevant either way. He told me 'well shouldn't you tell me before you never see me again then?'. Oh he also asked me 'if you were gay, would you top or bottom. WTF what straight guy would ever ask that even as a joke. Oddly specific.

It got weirder from there. He'd ask me all the time and make sexual jokes (I give a cynical response about clapping/dancing to his joke? He tells me yes....on his lap). He even rubbed my arm recently, unprovoked, and THEN he asked me a question after he done it. Asking why my arms are extremely soft and if I put lotion on (I don't...but lol). Plays music? Sings me the songs (stomach fuzziness to the max now). Asks my opinion on the songs and when I say I like them he tells me 'no you don't you only liked it cuz I sang it for you.' Even though they're guy oriented songs, they have some lovey dovey lyrics.

I honestly don't know what to think...I don't know what is making me have these feelings for him that I don't have with other guys/girls. If he's not gay, I wouldn't be sad one bit. I would be happy that I would know his true intentions (to be a nice accepting guy friend), and would be fortunate to have such a good friend I can click with well. I've done no initiating, no asking questions for myself. Just making neutral but kind remarks about what he says and does so he at least doesn't get a bitch vibe from me. But something tells me I should do or say something. It's seriously killing me inside -_-. I get all these scenarios in my head, that he's playing me and is doing all this to fuck with me. Or maybe he's only a friend, but still fucking with me. Or maybe he's curious and is really eager to know what I'm hiding. God dammit. I don't want to ruin anything. But it's just torture.

I've worked in an office for an intership, volunteered with a youth service and was asked to help at a sale for 1 day a year ago. But nothing that pays a wage or could be considered experience

I send out CVs when I hear places are looking, I email them to businesses, I drop them in in person, I regularly check classifieds, jobseekers websites and newspapers for vacancies but no one wants to hire me. Whilst trying to be as humble as possible, I've seen young people tut and sigh when they've had to put their phone away so they could come and serve me in a shop. I've been served by kids that cant be older than 11. I KNOW for a fact I could do a better job than them.

But whenever relatives or friends or even strangers talk to me about being unemployed and why I haven't gotten a job yet, in a tone like they think I'm sitting in my underwear scratching my balls all day I want to scream. I don't get benefits. I care for my disabled dad in my spare time, I don't get any help for that. I'm in college, I'm not sitting around doing nothing. Employers often market 'flexibility' as a positive aspect of a position when in fact it just means part time employees cant organise a life around their job, they have to be constantly available. Available for full time hours but only work part time. Flexibility is not an advantage for the employee.

So often on this sub I see ""get a job"" as a solution to many peoples varying problems, whether its wanting to move away or struggling with money or school. For some getting a job is as easy as asking a relative for a position in the business they own, run or work for. Not everyone is that lucky. I asked on facebook of my friends who work how they got their first job;

EVERY SINGLE ONE said they got it through a relative or a friend; that isn't networking, that's nepotism.

I have a feeling this wont be well received here, especially since in America being unemployed is a lot more socially unacceptable than in Europe and the UK and Ireland, but when the things you do to try and turn your life around are at the mercy of other people then you begin to lose faith really quickly.

I live with my parents in a small town, I go to college in the town I grew up in. I feel suffocated by my situation and if I ever hope to get out of this situation, I need money and so I need to work, but I'm being denied work.

This turned into a rant more than a request for advice so I apologise but I just felt the need to say, getting a job isn't as easy as telling someone to go and get one and to give unemployed people a break, the majority don't want to be unemployed.

**EDIT:**I should clarify that shit jobs are the very ones I am applying for. Sales assistant, fast food worker, cleaner, barman. All the positions that would be considered entry level.

Unfortunately in Ireland a government sponsored internship programme for graduates is being taken advantage of by business who are offering 9 month internships in things like forecourt attendance and sandwich making. They are also only open to those in receipt of benefits.

I don't really understand how to find a meaningful relationship with another guy. I feel like all the approaches I try are wrong, and I feel as if I don't have anything that is advantageous to my favor. 

I've tried approaching guy who I find interesting through basic conversation but they are always straight. I've tried Grindr as well but the only people I seem to attract are old creepy men who see me as a feminine bottom (I'm a 5'7 Black guy who looks way younger than my age and I don't consider myself masc or fem just a regular ass dude). I don't seem to stand out or get approached whenever I go out and I am pretty awkward so that makes me feel a bit bad about myself. 

I like who I am, but I feel as if I'm reaching a point where I just want to settle for anyone and I don't care who. It's been three years since I've been with another guy sexually (never done anal), and I've never been in a committed relationship in my life. I've been alone and partially content for so long but now it's aching and I'm getting tired of it. I am strongly attracted to guys with long hair (especially metalheads, even though I don't know the first thing about meta but am willing to learn) but I can never find that type anywhere, but even if I did I don't think they'd be attracted to me. I feel like I am about to reach a breaking point and I just can't hold on anymore. I am even reaching the point where I might consider killing myself a possibility if nothing works out for me.

So naturally I want him now…he's now smart, eccentric, handsome, AND fit. He's a perfect catch. I tell him I'd like to start something with him because I fell for his personality a while ago…now there's something physical and all he said was ""no thanks."" I'm like…what? Not to brag, but I'm hot. I have a cute face, I'm muscular, I have a big dick. Trust me, there are always plenty of willing guys so, yes, I guess that's given me the option to be more picky (although I don't look down on others for their physical aspects…I just have a certain albeit stereotypically attractive look I go for).  
  
This has been going on for months. Since we're still friends, we hang out, even drunk he won't accept my advances on him. I know he resents the fact I didn't like him when he was fat, but it's not my fault what I'm attracted to. And this isn't even a physical thing too…yes, he's hot and I want to fuck his brains out, but I do like his personality and think I could fall in love with him one day. I think I fucked it up though and I'm just sad…he's the one that got away and I fucking hate it. I can't stop thinking about him and hanging out with him just makes it worse.  
  
Sigh…and, yes, like I said there are plenty of willing guys but trust me I've fucked enough hot guys to know that most of them don't come with brains and when they do they slip away so quickly.  
  
Do you bros think there's any way I can romance him still? How can I get this guy back? I've tried for months and nothing has worked. I've been hearing he's starting to see this other guy we both know and it pisses me off. It's so superficial, but this guy isn't as good looking as me and friends that have hooked up with him have told me he's hung like a mouse….and now I can't understand what he has that I don't.

I know life isn't fair, but whenever I come here and see someone go on and on about how ""Hey! I just got into med school!"" Or ""Hey! Just came out to my teammates, they were awesome!"" I feel like my gut is about to rip open. It seems like everything that can go wrong with my life has. Medically, socially, financially, there's always something new. It Gets Better videos are shit.
