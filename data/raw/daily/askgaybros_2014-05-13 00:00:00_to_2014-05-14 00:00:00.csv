We both agreed that it would be a good idea if we refrained from sex for a while so our relationship wouldn't be based around sex. It was cool at first, I was really into this guy, so I had no problem putting my sexual desires aside just to get closer to this guy. After a few weeks in, we began messing around. No anal, just more of blow jobs and jacking each other off. Don't get me wrong, it was great. We messed around almost daily and I loved it. I've only been messing around with guys for about a year now (I'm 21) and my bf has been with WAAAAAY more guys than me seeing he came out in high school (hell be 21 next month)--. I love sex, but I feel as if my bf has been with so many guys sex is just like ""blah"" to him. We've been together for three month and this past month we've probably fucked around one time. It seems like He doesn't even want to come near my dick and it kinda bothers me. I even tried to suck his dick today and he wasn't into it at all. It kind of upsets me because I want to be intimate with him but I feel as if he's not even attracted to me anymore. I'm a very good looking guy if I don't say so myself.. I'm well groomed and go to the gym on a regular basis. I've told him that I've felt ignored lately and he has made an effort to give me more attention but when I say I feel ignored, I kind of mean it as, we don't fuck around like we used to. I don't wanna flat out and say that cause I don't wanna make to seems like sex is all I want, because it's not. I really do love my bf. this is the first guy I've ever been serious with. Idk if I'm just smitten or if what we have is truly genuine. What do you guys think? You think I'm a dick for wanting sex? Whenever I get around him I'm automatically horny, but I rarely try anything with him anymore because when I do he's just so blah about it and not into it. I don't wanna end a relationship just because we don't have sex but I love sex. And if things are like this now I'm just thinking of what our sex life will be like down the road. Idk what to think.

That being said, I know I'm not a perfect ten, just as I know I won't connect with *everybody*.

That's life.

But, from experience, it seems so much harder for guys to give me any time of day, be it at the bars, in clubs, etc. And, admittedly, I'd say that the blame is partially on me; I'm not perfect, and maybe I said something wrong, couldn't keep up with the beat, or maybe had spinach in my teeth. Who knows?

*But*, what I have seen is other gay men who've claimed that their race often results in a smaller dating pool, and a less fulfilling dating life. And, while I can't say I've experienced the same, overtly, I *might* be experiencing it in more subtle ways.

*I'd be damned if I get replies back on Grindr, Hornet, or OKCupid.*

*If I don't lead a conversation (be it in a bar, club, etc.), I generally won't be approached.*

*If I AM approached, I'm fetishized, as if the only functioningpart of me is my penis.*

So, my question is, firstly, (and I hate to ask this, but) is it because I'm black?

And, out of curiosity, what is it I can do about it? Something with my hair, maybe? Should I get a new wardrobe?

Firstly, we started off slow and got to know each other about 7/8 months ago. He found out I was gay and he had no problems with it what so ever. Since then, we've got closer and closer and we text virtually all the time now and when we're together in with our friendship circle we're normally together. 

Right so, despite having a really good friendship with him about two months ago, I didn't have no real attraction to him. I loved him and thought he was a brilliant person, but as a friend. But since then, we've got closer but literally and physically at times and he has shown signs he could be into guys. A few weeks ago he went through a stage where he literally couldn't stop talking about this one guy (a celeb) and saying things like 'He'd get it' and said that even out of both sexes, this one male celeb was his ultimate crush. In additon this, he rates guys loads and is constantly talking about hot guys lately and sending me pics via text of other celebs and people who he thinks our hots.

Following on from this, he has agreed he'd go to a gay bar with me (we were joking) and I said I'd totally hit you up with a guy, to which he responded 'haha please do', then I was like 'Would you actually?' then he said 'possibly but unlikely'. In addition to this, when I told him about my gay friend, he took immense interest and added him on Facebook and called him 'fucking gorgeous' and I should get with him, which I found totally bizarre as I only know this guy on the internet. 

The other day was the final straw for me. We went out and I asked him how things he is with girl he obsesses over and whether he likes her still. He became really awkward and just said 'I'm confused', I was like 'You can trust me', then he said 'I know but I can't trust the others', to which the others came over and the convo died. He was drunk at this point and later that night we shared a quilt and got very close, admittedly I was the one getting closer to him and putting my head on him, but he didn't make any effort to move away. Its common knowledge in our friendship group he really likes this girl, so for him to say that confused me. He has said other things to me like 'You're the only one I can open to' etc etc

Other things are like, he has had one girlfriend and always says things like 'guys are more fun to talk about'. He kisses me a lot on the cheek when he gets drunk and says 'There is more chance of me getting into a relationship with a guy than there is a girl', because he 'sucks with girls'. I've also heard a story of where he got off with a guy when he was drunk.

So many signs and collectively its given me hope. But deep down, I really do think he is straight. He plays football and he is (quite) macho. 

Its really, really, tormenting me. I seriously like him and I hate myself for it. Its getting to that point where I'm starting to get down if he hasn't texted me or if he starts talking about girls.
