But I just felt that I needed to share my experience with this issue after reading so many posts about it here.

Please, be careful with sex. Be more safe than others tell you you should. Educate yourself as much as possible.

BUT...

Don't let it ruin your life. I've spent so much time worrying about getting diseases that it has completely consumed me. I'm a mid-20s, objectively not-unattractive and popular guy with a very active social life and lots going for me. I have dated tons of men and women and have had opportunities for tons more. But I cannot manage to do anything sexually anymore. It makes me so damn terrified.

The thing with anxiety is that it has a snowball effect - it starts out small, and gets bigger and bigger. I started out worrying about HIV, so I spent endless hours researching it. I ended up convinced that I had it (even though I've never had penetrative sex and only tried oral 3 times with healthy people), but also that I could never have penetrative sex. So that was me for a while. Then, I realised that I couldn't give oral sex for fear of HIV and other diseases. So I would occasionally accept blowjobs. Then, I got terrified of catching herpes or other diseases, so I stopped doing that. Then I got terrified of catching diseases from cum, so I stopped giving/getting handjobs. Then I would only allow some kind of naked touching, but then I got more and more obsessive about herpes, and stopped doing that too. Now, even kissing is a very traumatic experience for me out of fear that I will get herpes, even though statistics show that I probably already do have it. So yeah, holding hands and hugging is all I can really tolerate right now.

I'm so embarrassed about it. All my friends who know that I'm bi see all the guys interested in me and assume I'm banging them all. But I don't even kiss them anymore. I haven't done anything more than kissing in years because of my damn fucking paranoia - not only do I assume I will catch diseases from every single person, but I assume that I have diseases like HIV and herpes and don't want to transmit them to others.

What have I lost from this anxiety? Literally thousands of hours of research into diseases, countless hours of crying and panicking about having diseases and imagining being diagnosed with them and how that will ruin my life, loss of sleep, loss of money spent buying preventive medicine (I've bought herpes antiviral meds and other things so many times), plus missing out on some opportunities to meet and get close to some amazing people. I panic about EVERY pimple/itch/tingle/redness/soreness/sore throat/headache/weight loss or gain/everything. I freak out that I have diseases and spend hours terrified daily. And I'm just really fucking sad and angry with myself for being like this. But I can't make it stop. It is so unbearably exhausting. 

Another element of it is that I don't even think having those diseases is so bad. I have so much compassion for people who suffer from any kind of illness and I feel that me being so terrified of diseases adds to the stigma around things like HIV and herpes, and I feel terrible about it...so much so that I don't talk to others about my anxiety. It hurts even more.

For those wondering, yes, I see a psychologist about this. I am in no denial that this needs to be helped. But it's a slow and tough process that often leaves you absolutely wiped out. I get sick and tired and drained all the time from putting my body under so much stress. This isn't my only issue (I have general anxiety and some family issues), but it's certainly the most debilitating.

So, I guess my point is that I want to warn you all against being so paranoid about diseases. If you find yourself obsessing about it, please see a psychologist or counsellor. Don't let it get to this stage. It really isn't worth it. I play the role of the confident, successful, smart, active, life-of-the-party guy, when inside I'm just a cowardly mess who spends hours terrified about stupid things and missing out on life. Don't let yourself slip.

Be safe and be happy.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know what my intention exactly is. But I just felt that I needed to share my experience with this issue after reading so many posts about it here.&lt;/p&gt;

Title says it all but i'll go into more detail.

* I'm a 21 year old guy and my entire life I've been certain in straight. Sure I'm a bit feminine sometimes but I never questioned it. I had actually never slept with anyone before college due to never having the opportunity due to not having a car able to have sex in and strict parents that are overprotective, etc. (though I have had numerous     gf's of varying length through high school)

* Anyway I moved away from my parents when I graduated high school and headed to college. I had a gay roommate and I was not attracted to him in a romantic way, yeah he was cool and is a good friend and such but I never found myself interested in him (not my ""type"".) 
Though through him I was more introduced into the lgbt culture. I never had any issues with lgbt or anything, just never really was interested in it either (no offense.) I hung out with many lgbt boys and girls through my roommate and just enjoyed hanging out with nice people.

* In college I dated several females that were openly bi and that didn't bother me in the slightest and actually found it slightly arousing. I of course slept with my numerous gf's and I can affirm that I enjoy sex with females and have no qualms with it. So when I graduated (I finished college early due to high school credits [not meaning to toot my own horn too much but I graduated with a 4.8 from high school and finished highest honors in college ;P ] Anywho I moved and got my own apartment with an old friend. As I was now free to live my own life I joined numerous facebook groups and eventually met a fellow cosplayer in one of the cosplay groups. (male)

* Anyway he is a very effeminate guy and I immediately started to crush on him. We talked all day about anything and everything and he asked me about sex and such as he is rather inexperienced (though I am by no means an expert! :P ) And I even went so far as to tell him I'm bi without a seconds thought when he asked me. I think about him quite often even while I was dating my previous gf of several months. He's sweet, kind, intelligent, drop dead sexy, and I have never felt this attracted to anyone (male or female) this much. My heart races when I get text from him and I look forward to talking to him every day.

* The fact that he is a boy does not bother me in the slightest when I think about him. I could picture myself being intimate in terms of kissing/cuddling/holding hands, etc. even in public but the thought of sex with any guy is still a bit weird for me. I would love to date him but he lives quite a bit farther away from me and I don't enjoy long distance relationships for personal reasons. And he agrees.

* Now before it's commented that it could be a one time thing, since beginning to talk to him I have noticed my attraction to other effeminate guys. I had actually felt this before on rare occasions with other guys I've met but I figured it was something else. I have 0 attraction to the majority of guys. But feminine guys like my friend make my heart race as well (not as much of course) and I enjoy chatting with them online. 

* I feel that perhaps my friend I'm crazy over was perhaps the overflowing point? As in perhaps he allowed me to realize my bisexual side? There are few if any guys my ""type"" around me so I can't experiment so I came online to ask advice from you guys. I'll post a pic of my friend (excuse me if the picture is in wrong format and please let me know if it is, this is my first reddit post with pics) 

* Anyway here's a pic of him.

and for reference here's a pic of myself: http://i59.tinypic.com/2mdm1jk.jpg

* tldr;    So basically, I'm not sure if I'm bi, and it's actually quite frustrating as I'm not sure if I just like the innocence or the feminine qualities, and if it's the feminine qualities, perhaps I just like females and am projecting it unto guys that meet my qualities I enjoy?

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve got an issue, dude contacted me on an app. Looking for FWB and we chatted etc. We&amp;#39;re talking about likes and dislikes and I bring up about guys being DL and having wives or girlfriends when they say that like to keep sex between them. Only do this because he says about being a regular dude but likes messing around with other guys in bed. ha ha the irony. Says he likes to keep it on the DL. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is he trying to tell me that he has a wife or girlfriend without actually saying it?

Keep in mind we're black so you know what kind of church this is, the obnoxious sounding preacher talking in syllables, and OF COURSE he mentioned that gay=sin.(on fcking easter)...so at this point I'm done

Now today this new boyfriend was telling a story about something &amp; he mentioned gays he called them ""sissies"", i stopped him there and told him not to call them that(Still in the closet to my family). Then he called them fags, i then called him homophobic. Another person said ""what if i called you a N*gger"". He said it's different, but it's not &amp; i let him know it's not. Sigh... fuck this guy, i guess in a way he's a good guy but my mom can do sooo much better..

Now that i know my mom's boyfriend is a homophobic asshole i can't ""come out"". He just helped her buy me a PS4... i mean.. like i want to come out but he's the type of guy to take the PS4 away.. :/ &amp; i need to beat Dragonage first!! haha

Guess what ""great news"" my mom gave me today? ""We're going to church twice a month!!"" WTF, and he convinced my mom that I'm straight and moving at a slower pace, she suspected i was gay before... moving backwards. 

I know my mom will always accept me and continue to support me and pay for my college though, but it'll be hard for her.

I'm starting to think i shouldn't come out.. Thoughts? I think I'm gonna stay closeted... idk","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So.. I&amp;#39;m seventeen years old &amp;amp; recently my mom got together with this new guy(she knew him a long time ago). So this past easter this guy and my mom decided to go church for easter(forced me to go). Now i didn&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;d end up in church again so i went in with an open mind. Keep in mind we&amp;#39;re black so you know what kind of church this is, the obnoxious sounding preacher talking in syllables, and OF COURSE he mentioned that gay=sin.(on fcking easter)...so at this point I&amp;#39;m done&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now today this new boyfriend was telling a story about something &amp;amp; he mentioned gays he called them &amp;quot;sissies&amp;quot;, i stopped him there and told him not to call them that(Still in the closet to my family). Then he called them fags, i then called him homophobic. Another person said &amp;quot;what if i called you a N*gger&amp;quot;. He said it&amp;#39;s different, but it&amp;#39;s not &amp;amp; i let him know it&amp;#39;s not. Sigh... fuck this guy, i guess in a way he&amp;#39;s a good guy but my mom can do sooo much better..&lt;/p&gt;

I met this guy who was somwhat older than me,he made the first move and at first,i wasnt interested but after a thread of messages...i really got to like him and eventually,fell deeply in love with him

He was so sweet,responsible and always kept flattering me(one reason i fell in love with him) we kinda made plans together for the future and he told me he wanted to be with me forever(meaning marriage) i was so heavily overjoyed with his presence in my life and i really loved him sooo much.

He told me he wasnt out yet,so he would come out to his family if he is really sure i wanted to be with him forever(i felt very special).
When i asked of his family matters,he told me he had his sister and her 2 kids staying with him in his house and that his sister was going through some crisis at the moment so he is helping her(wow,what a great guy he is,very responsible).

We met around mid of 2013,and we enjoyed each others company alot until somwhere around ending 2013 he told me he was going for a deployment(he is in the army).He said it was a year deployment so hopefully,he would be back in 2014....i felt sad but i knew he had to do his work.....so i guess he left or so.

I guess you cant have your personal gadgets with you always at deployment (i was told by him) so i used to update him and send pics of whatever was going on in my life to him through instant messaging apps and he would also reply me back when he could with hopes of us being together forever when he is back.i really had dreams and fantasies of what life would be for both if he was back and i was really happy even though he was away (or that what i though) 

So it remained that way to 2014, and through 2014....i mostly did the writing and he would only reply me after  some two or three messages ( well i thought he was in deployment so he was doing his best to reply back) .At the end of 2014,he still wasnt back home even though he said it was a year deployment....but i never minded because i knew he would be back oneday definitely......during that time,my family found out i was gay and it really went wrong but in all my sorrows,i knew i had someone i loved and who also loved me somewhere and that oneday i would be happy,so the thoughts of suicide crossed my mind but just thinking of him gave me strength and hope.


So itz 2015 now and he is still not back and doesnt reply me back as often as he used to but i still stayed strong and never gave up hope ( because i thought it was the fault of his work). Well,just until now that i signed up for instagram and searched for accounts through my contacts..... his contact gave me an account,but there wasnt much to view because his account was somewhat empty with only 4 pics which seemed to have been posted not too long ago  ( considering his deployment time,it was quite recently posted) so i didnt know how that was possible and also all pics were that of a female.I didnt think he could be instagraming at deployment,so sadly i started thinking he might have died and his phone was being used by someone else.But i tried not to think that way and forgot that thought.

So i decided to go through his followers list and i found a teenage girl with his kinda surname.So i instantly followed her thinking she could be a relative of my boyfriend.I then sent her a direct pic of my boyfriend asking her if she knew him( i  expected her to answer probably saying that is my uncle or so but nope!! She told me yea.... that is my DADDY) omg!!! I instantly felt a heartbeat sharply.....i really got confused and very very down.
She then went on asking me how i got that picture, i only said her dad was my friend and that upon coming across her name,i decide to ask so to know if they were related.I also asked if her dad was still in deployment and she told me,her dad had quit the army and that he was home ( i really didnt know how to process this information and it got me emotionally) .I scrolled through the girl's account only to find an easter family portrait posted by her....in the photo had a lady( am guessing his wife) one little boy and girl  and also his teenage daughter,then finally him( my so called boyfriend i loved) I was so hurt and even started shedding tears because i felt he was playing,deceiving and lying to me all this time.....for christ sake,its been almost 2 years now since he made me believe he was at deployment....only to found out hes got a family and was just playing me on.i even sent other guys away because i knew i had found my dream and what i want....only to know that dream is impossible.So am guessing his alleged sister and kids are his wife and his own kids.

I really dont know what to do now because i so loved him very very much and i always told him that ,with him also telling me the same thing back and that we are going to be together.How can we be together if you already married and have been hiding it and deceiving me all this time,making me dream on and thinking you're at deployment and upon your return,it going to be happily ever after.I feel like a fool,somwhat stupid waiting for someone who barely even left the country and continued to play me on for almost 2 years until now that i found out.
I havnt told his daughter anything and dont plan on it ....i also dont know if i should write to him telling him what i just found out or do nothing and wait for him to tell me more lies raising my hopes high....am really hurt now that i feel so worthless because thinking of him and being together made me stay strong to battle my sorrows and rejects during my coming out....what should i do?


TL,DR....just found out the guy i made plans with about being together had been lying to me all this time and indeed had a family already with kids.am really hurt and dont know if i should  make him aware of his deception...

I don't mind this nor do I combat it as it's better than being completely shunned from the family. My parents are fairly americanized but are still religious and as such, they completely disagree with my sexuality.

My father and I don't talk that often. My brother and I never talk. My mother and sister and I arguably have the best relationship. I've never questioned my mother about my sexuality but today at an Olive Garden over lunch I struck up a conversation about it. It started out with her refusing to wanting to talk about it but I pushed her. I wish I hadn't. In the past year I've grown extremely independent which is the polar opposite of what my family culture is. I have a job, my own car, I don't have a curfew and do essentially whatever I want and soon in a few months I'll be moving out. I tell my mother that regardless of how my independent lifestyle goes against our culture, that I love her along with all my family members deeply, which I do. My mother continues to tell me that she doesn't believe what I feel for them is love. According to her, sacrifice is love. She tells me that my sister who has an americanized version of an arranged marriage will have extreme difficulty finding a husband because they'll always question why I am so distant from the family. My brother will eventually marry as well and his wife would exploit him if she ever found out about me. None of my relatives from Pakistan contact my mother anymore ever since I blocked all of them from my Facebook including my own family to not show them my ""gayness"".

Regardless of all this, she says she still has a maternal instinct and still loves me but she will never forgive me or accept me being gay, ever. That's what got to me. She still loves me. She fundamentally disagrees with who I am but will still admit that she has a responsibility as a mother to love me.

Hearing this totally fucked me up. My being gay really has screwed with what their culture is. My sisters future suitors will always be questionable and perhaps refuse a marriage because of the missing little brother(me) in the equation. I've effectively ruined communication between my extended family and family because I blocked them all from Facebook and stopped communicating with them. I'm sure they do know somehow and that's ruined my extended family and families relationship.

After being released from the hospital, I contacted my university professors who were universally unwilling to work with me to finish out this semester even at the behest of the dean of students.

I don't have a real reason to live, though I've spent years doing the things I care about. Unfortunately, it's been a month now and I don't really have anything to get me out of bed each day. But, I don't want to get all existential and stuff, because that's something I should take care of. Instead, I want to ask Reddit et al. about the options I have for my life.

First off, I have about two grand in the bank, no car or notable possessions outside of a computer I've built. I have a steady 3.9GPA during my first two years at a state university in Texas.
My employment experience includes ( [here's my resume](http://i.imgur.com/zB11vY0.png) ):

* Working as a microexpression behavior analyst and manager of a psychology research lab during my freshman year. This gives me hefty experience in academia and management, sadly I was screwed out of authorship on my very own studies (employer began defaulting on wage payments, I resigned 
* An IT gig repairing broken computers on campus for two months (no certifications, but able to pass the A+ certification test easily). This was a really soul crushing job that I resigned from due to professional conflict, and I don't list it on my resume.
* I have experience as a university volunteer tutor for 12 subjects over two-three semesters (A's for grades, and I can tutor any subject I ace). Since I was not on the tutoring certification ""track"" at work, I will not get references for this, though.
* My major in college for the first semester was psychology, but I prompty switched to computer science to diversify my skillset. However, I have only taken core classes (Technical Writing, history etc) and have not taken CS courses or programming lessons.

Anyways, today I filled in my medical withdrawal paperwork and dropped out of the university. I have currently been unemployed for half a year. I am in a dead-end college town in Texas that I absolutely hate, and my lease expires mid-May. Perhaps it's not the best time to think about making a move, but I fear getting financially trapped in a stagnant town that I hate. Since I'm 20, now is probably a good time to find a good place to live with good employment that has upward mobility. I don't have any family or friends at all (I am LGBT, was homeless during high school for that + medical difficulties).

I don't really have any aspirations in my life other than to work in a healthy, sustainable environment in an LGBT friendly city.

So I guess my questions would be:

* If you were in my situation, what would you do?
* If I were to move somewhere, where would be the best place? (LGBT friendly, inexpensive cities with career opportunities for folks like me. I really want to leave Texas for good, I grew up here and don't enjoy the cities).
*What kind of careers should I look into? What kind of opportunities are there? (I have asthma/ADHD, so no on the military)

Your advice on this would help, I'm trying to figure out what to do with my life.

I met this guy a few weeks ago, and we hit it off hard. Cute, funny, smart, and into the same stuff i am to an absurd degree, seemed pretty great. We've been on three dates and had a ton of fun, sex has been fantastic, and the conversation has been even better. weve both expressed that we really liked each other, and wanted to see ware this could go. He does improv, and i was exited to watch him perform, so i went to one of his shows and laughed my ass off, after i texted him to meet up, and he said he couldn't go out but would say hi, no problem, i know what its like to be busy. When we met he seemed really distant though, as if i was intruding in some way, I ignored it and we said we'd get together that weekend. The weekend came and went, and he said he was too busy to hang out, that's fine, Im flexible, but now and its been a few days without a single text and its slightly worrying. I really like this guy, Im exited to see ware this could go, and i thought he was too, now i feel a little snubbed, if hes honestly lost interest I can get over it but, i dont like not knowing, and i cant ask without making it seem dead already. It could be that hes simply been really busy, and hasn't had time to get back to me, i hope that's the case but i dont know. I should mention that ive been hung up to dry buy guys ive liked before, just stopped calling me and let me get the message, which seems like a really shitty way to end things with someone, so maybe Im paranoid.

Anyone got advice, did he lose interest, do i need to just calm the fuck down, or am i expecting too much?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writing this might be all it takes to get me to settle down, but i guess i just need someone to tell me what i may already know.&lt;/p&gt;
