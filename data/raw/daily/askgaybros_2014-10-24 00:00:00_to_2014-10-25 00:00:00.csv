He apologized and said he is with her friend who is crying about a fight with her parents. He said he wants to see me and is sorry.  So he said he is heading home now to shower. 

Around 10 I texted again and he said he just got home and will shower and eat something quick.  I said we can eat out but he said he doesn't have money and needs to eat his gym meal.

Around 10:30pm he texts me saying he wants to see me but maybe we should grab breakfast tomorrow at 9am. 

It is today I texted him at 8 to see if we are still grabbing breakfast. As of now it is 9:35am and I haven't gotten a response from him yet. Its 10:40am and still no respond back but he is on online on the dating app.

(Back story I met this guy a while back and things were going well until he had money and ex bf issues. So he stopped talking to me for 7 months and randomly texted me a week and half ago apologizing how he just left abruptly. I honestly liked this guy but I annoyed)

What would you guys do in this situation?

I haven't had the confidence and courage to come out to anyone ever, and I finally did so this past Sunday to my parents. Since I moved to another state for college, I don't get to see my parents in person except when I visit for winter breaks typically. 

I decided to come out to my parents individually over the phone. Originally I thought it was a good idea and thought they wouldn't be too surprised or take it too badly as they are fairly liberal and progessive people. However, when I told them, the first response I got was ""how do you know you are gay?"" 

This preceded a fairly lengthy conversation of trying to prove to them that I am in fact 100% gay and not questioning my sexuality anymore. 

Throughout the conversation they asked me if I was ever sexually abused as a child and proceeded to tell me that this is shocking to them and that they had never seen any ""signs"" that I was gay throughout my childhood. 

In the end, they told me they accept me and love me no matter what, even if I ""was on death row."" However, this is very shocking news to them, and just something more they have to worry about. They tell me they worry about me being discriminated against and how the news will spread to other people the more I come out. 

They don't want me to come out to really anyone, and my father doesn't want me to come out to my siblings until they mature, and even went as far as to say to wait until they are 25 years old! (I am the oldest, and they are 20 and 18 years old). 

My parents tell me that the news over the phone was a real bombshell and they feel like they don't really know me now. I suppose the way i told them over the phone was a bit much, but I explained to them that at that moment I had just the right amount of courage to come out to them and may not have been able to later. 

So, how should I feel about this? I don't feel like my parents are 100% supportive and I really do want to tell my siblings. It seems like my parents are wanting me to keep everything hush hush, and I want to tell my siblings and specific close friends. 

Am I feeling the wrong way? Are my parents not fully accepting? I know my siblings won't be too bothered by it, shoud I tell them?

Basically I started talking to a guy on OKCupid a few weeks ago who lives about 500 miles away, based purely on thinking he was cute and having similar interests. We've been sort of IMing on and off since then, both wanting to keep some electronic distance just because we admitted that it was kind of torture to be in touch like that but unable to actually physically meet. We still talk every now and then, including tonight, but he doesn't seem as eager to converse with me like we did at first and if conversation does ever move to eventually making the effort to meet in person, even if proposed by him, his enthusiasm is usually isolated to us fucking.

Problem is (as if this already wasn't a bad idea), I'm a stupid, immature 21 year old who's never been in a relationship before. Which means I've spent the last few weeks with this guy on my mind, mentally filling in his gaps with dream qualities and etc, putting him on a pedestal because I've been anxious, lonely, and depressed and the idea of being in love and having a boyfriend is much more appealing than actually putting in the effort of getting to know/liking someone. And now I'm just sort of stuck dealing with the fact that I've developed feelings for something that isn't real, and it sucks.

So I guess if I did have a question it would just be like ""on a scale of 1-10, how bad did I fuck up?"". Or maybe I'd just want advice on how you guys dealt with dashed/unfulfilled romantic prospects when you were as young and dumb as I was and didn't really know what you were doing.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not really sure if I have an actual question, just looking to get some of this out. &lt;/p&gt;

It worked out, but of course It has its cons. I live in a southern town and attend a college in an even more southern town. I'd like to ask men out in person for numerous reasons. I know it can be done. 

Here's the problem. I am very socially awkward and wish to get out of my comfort zone. I have gained the courage to ask him out, but what do I say? There's a boy at my school whom I'd like to ask out for coffee and such. He's well dressed (he dresses like a scholarly gentleman) and super shy. I doubt he'd ever approach me. I look over at him all the time in the school lobby (the only time I ever see him) and often he's starring at me before I get a chance to look at him. I came out to a friend of mine in that lobby which is very close to his table (the lobby is very small and quiet) and I'm sure he heard me. Now he's been starring at me more and more.

Hilarious side story: Today, I was exiting the lobby to go find some friends to talk to, but I made a split-second decision to go out of the other door. I hate crowds of people. But before I could make the trek across the lobby I see the really attractive boy enter through that door. He is starring at me and my thought process went; ""Oh shit he's going to think I'm crazy going in his direction when I was obviously leaving out this door, oh I should talk to him, what do I say?"" The group of friends saw my internal conflict as I hung there almost pacing so I acted as if I lost my book near them and they believed it. Then I left out of the door I was initially leaving from. I've never had this happen to me before and I've had many of crushes. 

I'm pretty sure even if he weren't gay he wouldn't be rude about it. But, how do I even start a conversation with a guy I've never talked to or even been near, or any type of connection? Do I just walk across the student lobby and say what?

He was pretty awesome and I wanted to talk to him, so I asked here whether I should attempt to contact him. Long story short, I did try, but there was some sort of administrative glitch that prevented it from going through. Whatever. I moved on. 


Over the summer a lot of talk regarding ""the one who got away"" came up, and pretty much reminded me of this one guy I had missed out on. Now, take into account that the last time I spoke to him was in October of last year. On a whim, almost two weeks ago I decided to try and message him again. It was completely random, and I wasn't even sure he was going to respond, but he did. We've been talking intermittently ever since. 


My problem is: I don't know what he wants. Honestly I was expecting just a super casual exchange, and then a ""It was nice talking to you again, best of luck in the future"", but he actually seems to want to continue the conversations. I'm doubtful in his interest though because he hasn't added me as a friend on Facebook and he'll go a day or so without sending a message, with delayed responses making me think that he isn't that interested.  


My motivations in originally messaging him were to get closure, to say that I had tried and that it wasn't meant to be, but he continues to message me, a near stranger, over a year later. It's kind of taking a toll on me personally because I was pretty much over him, but now I'm going through the motions of a crush again, while I prefer a bit more stability in my final year of university. 


My question is this: Is he just being nice, and therefore, should I just bring things to a close for my sanity's sake? Or, do you believe that there is an interest there that keeps him talking to me that I should attempt to move forward with?

Thanks guys!

I&amp;#39;m doubtful in his interest though because he hasn&amp;#39;t added me as a friend on Facebook and he&amp;#39;ll go a day or so without sending a message, with delayed responses making me think that he isn&amp;#39;t that interested.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My motivations in originally messaging him were to get closure, to say that I had tried and that it wasn&amp;#39;t meant to be, but he continues to message me, a near stranger, over a year later. It&amp;#39;s kind of taking a toll on me personally because I was pretty much over him, but now I&amp;#39;m going through the motions of a crush again, while I prefer a bit more stability in my final year of university. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question is this: Is he just being nice, and therefore, should I just bring things to a close for my sanity&amp;#39;s sake? Or, do you believe that there is an interest there that keeps him talking to me that I should attempt to move forward with?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks guys!&lt;/p&gt;

We were asked to interview a gay or lesbian individual about their life, and in particular the recent Supreme Court ruling.

Questions:

1.	How do you feel about the recent Supreme Court Ruling regarding same-sex marriage?

2.	Do you ever plan on having/adopting children?

3.	Do you plan on getting married in light of current events?

4.	What are your feelings toward religion?

5.	When did you first realize your orientation? How did you feel then?

6.	Did people accept you coming out?

7.	How did your family react to you coming out?

8.	Do you feel that you are treated equally in everyday society?

9.	What are your hopes for the future of American society?

I feel a little bad for asking people like this, it seems crude, and some of these questions are very personal. If this isn't okay to post, I'll take it down immediately. I don't mean to offend anyone.

I really like this guy. The first week or so, I was worried about the age difference but I got over it. I really couldn't care less now. 

Cuddling is awesome. We cuddle a lot. I really really like him. One time he was sick and I even went over to his place and held him through the night as he shivered. I didn't care if I risked getting sick. I just wanted to take care of him. 

I try to please him sexually. I suck his dick and I have eaten his ass on occasion. He claims to be a bottom but he's still not allowed me to fuck him. He won't even suck my dick. All he wants to do is cuddle and make out which kind of gives me blue balls. We usually end up just jerking off together. I ask him what's up but he doesn't really explain. 

If he were to come at me with ""I just don't like anal sex"" I'd be ok with it... some guys don't. (but I'd still wonder about the oral) 

If he came at me with ""I'm a Christian and I'm waiting till marriage"" I'd be ok with that too.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve found that a number of men that I ask out get a little... weird when I drop the word &amp;quot;date.&amp;quot;  When being asked out, do y&amp;#39;all prefer something more like &amp;quot;wanna grab drinks?&amp;quot;  Or do you appreciate when the guy makes it clear he sees it as a date?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking a poll.&lt;/p&gt;

Typically, I'll swipe ""Yes"" to profiles where I find the person to be at least somewhat attractive (On a scale of 1 to 10 of attractiveness, I'd say about 6) AND who shares a few interests with me (I'm a gamer and geeky type of guy, preferably looking for someone with similar interests). 

Then there's the profiles I'll almost instantly swipe ""No"", typically because I'm really not attracted to the guy or because there are a few things that are big pet-peeves of mine (smoking for example).

The rest of the profiles are profiles I'd rather just ""skip"" rather than swipe ""No"" to because who knows, maybe there's something, I just don't see a reason to contact them, but I don't see a reason to shut down the possibility either. However most apps are built with a black&amp;white function rather than allowing for people to just skip someone.  


**TL;DR** : What makes you swipe ""Yes"" or ""No"" when you look at online dating profiles?
