We became friends, but we weren't that close until he learned I had horribly broken with my previous boyfriend, and he has been probably one of my most supportive friends about this.

I always found this guy attractive and I like him, but I never considered anything because he is straight.

As far as I know, he is interested in girls, and even thou he told me once he may be bisexual, he has never showed any kind of interest in guys, and I kind of considered he saying that as saying that he is open minded.
Also, he told me I was his first gay friend, and even made many of the straight guy questions (like who is the girl in the relationship and things like that).

Thing is, I recently stayed at his house for a day, and since his room was all full of shit, we sleept on the floor.
He was uncomfortably close to me, and I couldn't sleep at all because my heart was about to explode, because when he was asleep he would start rubbing his feet aginst mine.

So after that night, I sent him a mail explaining him how I wasn't able to sleep because of this, especially because, and this is what I wrote, ""if you werent straight, I would be aiming for you"", and to be more careful in the future.
But his response was completely unexpected. He told me I was misunderstanding him, and that i was ""Completely welcomed"" to fall in love with him.

When I asked him what he meant by that, because I wouldn't want to fall for a straight guy, he told me ""I like women. But I also like you"" but then told me ""If you ask me to be your boyfriend, the answer is no. You are right now still heart-broken, and as such you can be easily influenced, and I don't pretend to use that. If I do that I feel I could lose you as a friend""

Question for those of you who run/have run their own business venture before. I'm 24, and run a decently successful production company (directing music videos, commercials, marketing content for festivals and brands etc.) It stemmed from my passion for film and in the past 2 years it's blown up bigger than what I could have imagined. 

My problem now is that I'm not enjoying the work. The constant stress, the e-mails, the clients demanding more and more. I used to be so excited to work in the industry but now it's become something I dread. 

So fellow bros, did you have your own business and what did you do when it started getting too much? Did you get a more stable job at another company, or power through and make changes to your own venture? Any advice/anecdotes would be amazing. 

As mentioned I work in the film/music industry. I left school in my final year and haven't returned because work was overloading school and I couldn't do both. I work from home (which is a big drawback). I don't really have any qualifications other than my CV/folio which is quite extensive - yet ultimately lacking in the education department.

I'm going to try to keep this short. 
I feel like I am becoming a blob of nothing. I'm uninspired, unmotivated, and find myself struggling to finish out projects.

Not only that but my sex drive has plummeted. I'm rarely turned on by any of my interests, and I have given up on porn.

I think this all started over the summer. I had been crushing on this guy for months before we began to go out. It lasted a week before he dumped me because he had issues with his sexuality. I grew depressed and just wanted to play video games. All my motivation to do something just stopped. 

After this relationship, one guy from my school and I began to hang out more and more till it was an every day thing for a few months. Things were good until my ex and I got back together, the relationship was going okay but I struggled to be sexually active around him. I think the fear of doing anything with him spawned after the first break up, because I am very shy when it comes to sex. I was also unhappy because he was putting pot and friends before me. He would ditch dates, fail to communicate with me, place priorities on other people except me, and showed little feelings compared to my feelings toward him. Because I knew this relationship wasn't going in the right direction I left him and moved on.   

As my mind began to fall away from my ex I started to develop feeling for my best friend that I've spent so much time with. At this point it's been 6-7 months of constantly being around each other. I got hints from him on and off, we watched porn together sometimes, we've made remarks to each other. he's Bi so I figured that he had mutual feelings towards me. After a few months of this I decided I would tell him how I truly felt. He took it well and said that he was not in a good state for a relationship right now. (He's very self conscious, and probably confused about himself.) So I understood and made sure he knew I knew this was a still a friendship. 

After that talk though our time spent together dropped monumentally. Instead of seeing each other a few times a week it was once every 2 weeks.

I noticed he was becoming more distant, etc. I feel like he was isolating himself or maybe hanging out with other people. He's told me hes been sick lately and got a problem with his liver. I don't know what to think so I've been stressed out that I fucked up my only friendship I got in the small area I live in.

After all of this I just feel drained. It's hard to function and get motivated now and I cant get horny anymore. I don't really understand why so that's why I'm asking Gaybros. I hope there's someone who knows what's going on and can help me.  

I'm 18, I shouldn't be having these issues.

I've been dating a guy for a year and a half.  We met on Grindr when he was visiting NYC.  Once he got back to where he lived, we started talking everyday and planned a trip to meet.  He flew to NYC and we hung out for the weekend and planned another trip.  Over the first few weeks, I feel head over heals for him, neither of us had any interest in Grindr, and we saw each other every month and talked pretty much every day.  After an awesome year, he moved to NYC and things started going downhill.  He didn't have a job or health insurance but wasn't that nervous as he still got paid for a few months.  The things that I would have been nervous about (job/health insurance/retirement) as a responsible 20-something didn't seem like a big deal to him.  Overall things were good, but we didn't really have a lot of balance as he became friends with all of my friends.  I felt like I needed to make him feel welcome so probably opened up my world too widely introducing him to my friends, my family, everyone.  However, he wasn't out and although he welcomed me into his friend group - things got weird when he would have me visit his family as a friend.  When we discussed this, he would get mad and say that he thought I was okay with him not being out to his family but as time went on and as he started knowing my extended family I felt like I was missing out and it made me sad as if I wasn't good enough for his family to know (I know he was from the south though so that made me a little less anxious about it knowing that it's different than the northeast where I grew up).  The last few months have been really rough.  He's told me that when he met me he was on depression and anxiety medicine but stopped taking them when he met me because I ""saved"" him.  His mom had died 2 years ago to cancer and he said that since then he had been going to therapy/taking medicine.  I was confused why he would stop taking his medicine and also felt that it was a big burden to tell someone that they had saved them.  I wanted to be supportive and glad that I helped make him happy, but once his negativity started rubbing off on me everything/all blame fell to me.  He said that I once made him happy and saved him and that now I don't show him affection.  He came up with accusations saying that I put my friends/job before him.  It started really bringing me down so we decided to take a break about 3 weeks ago.  Over the last month, he has also started drinking a lot and I'm worried about him having an alcohol problem on top of depression.  He would text me saying that he drank an entire bottle of whiskey (lying) and also just overall drank during the day texting me while I was at work.  I tried to address this with him but overall, I just feel that I shouldn't have to be the one helping him.  He's a 29 year old man.  I understand that he's been through a lot in his life and probably more hurt than the average person (losing his mom, moving to a new city from a suburban area in the South).  My question is how do you know when to draw the line between putting up with someone's depression/alcoholism and when to cut off the relationship completely?  We aren't together anymore but he had been pretty cruel at the end of the relationship (sending pictures of guys in his bed, telling me how he used me to move to NYC, de-friending my entire family on Facebook).  It seems so weird how he could alternate between such a sweet, kind hearted guy and a cruel, manipulative person.  I'm at the point where I've told myself that as much as I still love him, he crossed the line and that I don't think I could ever trust him again.  But since we broke up, I'm feeling so lonely and looking at the dating seen in NYC I realized why I was so attracted to this guy to begin with.  At what point are you abandoning someone you love who is in need of support and at what point do you need to look out for yourself and drop the bullshit despite loving someone so much?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey - So this is my first post.

I tried to address this with him but overall, I just feel that I shouldn&amp;#39;t have to be the one helping him.  He&amp;#39;s a 29 year old man.  I understand that he&amp;#39;s been through a lot in his life and probably more hurt than the average person (losing his mom, moving to a new city from a suburban area in the South).  My question is how do you know when to draw the line between putting up with someone&amp;#39;s depression/alcoholism and when to cut off the relationship completely?  We aren&amp;#39;t together anymore but he had been pretty cruel at the end of the relationship (sending pictures of guys in his bed, telling me how he used me to move to NYC, de-friending my entire family on Facebook).  It seems so weird how he could alternate between such a sweet, kind hearted guy and a cruel, manipulative person.  I&amp;#39;m at the point where I&amp;#39;ve told myself that as much as I still love him, he crossed the line and that I don&amp;#39;t think I could ever trust him again.  But since we broke up, I&amp;#39;m feeling so lonely and looking at the dating seen in NYC I realized why I was so attracted to this guy to begin with.  At what point are you abandoning someone you love who is in need of support and at what point do you need to look out for yourself and drop the bullshit despite loving someone so much?&lt;/p&gt;

So... I got about $100 in Amazon gift cards between Xmas and my birthday next week. I've got it into my head that I'd like to invest in some of those coffee-table books of homoerotic fine art photography. I'm a fan of vintage as well as contemporary. This isn't just about seeing naked men--I mean, I've got an internet connection, obviously--but perhaps unsurprisingly the male nude really triggers my sense of aesthetics. I'm hoping to be turned on and enlightened, if that makes sense. A sense of history is a plus.

Any suggestions?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi guys!&lt;/p&gt;
