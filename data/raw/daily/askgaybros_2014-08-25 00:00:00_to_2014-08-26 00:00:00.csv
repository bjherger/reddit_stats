I'm not really sure what I'm on here to ask or even entirely how I feel about that. I go back and forth. Right now I feel awfully alone and just wish I had someone to talk to or do things with.

Both being alone and not being alone scares me and which one scares me more changes from moment to moment. 

I guess I'm asking how to deal with loneliness and accept a life spent alone? This seems the most realistic option since it seems unlikely I'm going to spontaneously learn how to deal with people and get friends after failing to do so in high school and college. If I could just stop the days like this where I feel this pitiful loneliness I'd be in a better position.

So i'm bisexual and I started seeing some guy who I had met on okcupid. It started with innocent texts and pictures like most of these types of things start off but then we started getting more serious and talking about the future and just other things that we probably shouldn't have at such an early stage; we haven't even met yet and were talking about where we would be months from now. After a few weeks of this I felt like we were already partners in a way. I mean I already trusted this guy which is unusual for me so I did the unusual and ran with it.

Well last week he messaged me out of the blue asking if we could meet since I was in town visiting friends for the weekend. I was a little tipsy from being at a party earlier that night so I agreed and he picked me up and we went to his house. I had never even hugged a guy before but by the time the night was over we had been intimate and shared things with one another that I hadn't planned. It was a really beautiful night. We were lost into one another and it was just special for me. It just felt right and it was like the world and the people and places outside of his room ceased to exist. But of course it ended and he dropped me off at home. At first I felt dissapointed in myself because i'm not the type to have sex with someone so early on but I felt and still feel in a way that he was the exception. I cared for him a lot and I wanted to share myself with him.

So after this I go back home and start to notice that his texts are less intimate and becoming less and less frequent. Before we would text intimate things all day and night and now I was lucky to be getting a few measly boring small talk texts. I started to feel like he was only talking to me to be nice or out of guilt for being my first so I told him that he didn't need to keep stringing me along and that if he wasn't interested in me that we didn't need to keep going like this. I had expected him to take up on my offer but instead he responded with a long letter about how much he cared for me and that he was willing to fight for me and that he wanted it to work between us and although I was surprised by this response I was also very happy. We discussed our feelings and agreed that we wanted a relationship and we talked about the future again and it felt like how it used to. Easy and natural. But after that the texts started to dwindle again and i'm lucky to get more than 5 a day. I'm suppose to see him again next weekend but I hate feeling like Im into someone who's not into me. I don't like being played and I don't like feeling like an option. I really like this guy and I want it to work as long as he likes me as much as I like him but if that's not the case then I don't want to do this anymore. I just don't know what to do. On one hand he is everything I want in a partner but on the other that could only be true if he felt the same way. I could deal with trust issues and detachment issues as long as I know he cares about me but I'm not sure how to tell. 

I get that this may sound dumb considering how long we've been seeing eachother but I really do care about this guy. It's just hard to see things deteriorate so quickly. I just feel so confused and stupid.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the wall of text and thanks for reading in advance it means a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

I've been seeing this guy for a month. We have sex pretty often, but he lives in another city so we only see each other a few days a week. The sex is awesome, I have zero complaints. 

One night, we started making out which lead to feeling each other which led to clothes coming off. I let him top me, but I told him to come on my chest (if that's weird/wrong, I don't want to be right.) So we are going and going and he tells me he's about to come. When he did, he shot it out so hard and there was SO MUCH. Like, it hit my neck! It was so damn hot. And what's weirder is we had sex the next day and the EXACT same thing happened, meaning it's always like that.

The reason giving the backstory is to give some comparison to me. I've read to drink more water, do kegels, eat healthy, not smoke, and not masturbate. Besides smoke, I have done all of those things and I just come a little bit and it definitely doesn't shoot. However, I will say sometimes when I masturbate I am able to get a pretty good shot/amount. It's more of an ego thing mostly because I feel somewhat ""inadequate."" He says he doesn't care at all and doesn't think it matters but dammit I do :/

So what can I do? I don't know if you can really improve it or maybe each person is different? Advice or ideas are welcome. I know it's a strange question but who the hell else can I ask?

I'm also using a throwaway so my friends don't see this.  

Earlier this month I came out to my best friend, it was really difficult because I come from a very religious family. I'm a very private person and it took a lot for me to finally get this out. I did it the night before I was going back home from college to visit my family, he was very supportive and naturally had lots of questions and was pretty surprised. We had a good long talk until we finally went to bed because I had my flight in a few hours.  

I went home the next day and while I was home I kind of came out to my hyper conservative brother who really wasn't supportive. I'm not really sure if he understood what I was telling him either because I was being as vague as possible. Anyway being home for a week and a half was very difficult and I felt very lonely and vulnerable. I'm typically very reserved around my family and find it very difficult to speak my mind because we see the world so differently. I've felt very vulnerable since I went home. I came back to college a few days ago and since then I've been in a bad mood.  Here's why...

My friend from high school was visiting and she was only sober for about half an hour out of the two nights I got to see her. Her and her friends were being very sloppy and belligerent and kind of rude to the people I tried to introduce them to. One of the nights she was here she was very touchy with my best friend. This made me uncomfortable because they've met before and she's infatuated with him, but she has a boyfriend back home. My best friend was not reciprocating because she was drunk and he knew she has a boyfriend. Moving along to the next night my friend continues being a mess and was very sad because she felt like none of my friends liked her. I ended up being a babysitter for her and her belligerent friends which put me in a worse mood.  

Long story short I think I'm jealous because I have feelings for my best friend. He is straight and I know this is a common problem for gay men and I've always tried to see my best friend as more of a brother but since I've come out to him I've felt very vulnerable and I've gotten a lot more attached. The night I came out he asked me if I had feelings for him and I had to lie because I didn't want our relationship to change and now I've found those feelings growing even stronger. I've never been this close to someone before and I don't know how to get over it. I haven't talked to him for a couple of days but I can't tell him it's because I'm angry/jealous but I don't want to push him away either. Where should I go from here?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to try to keep this as short as possible.

So here's the sitch. There was this guy who started to chat with me on one of the Apps - really good looking and interesting and, better yet, expressed a clear interest in me. It's been a long time since I've been on a date and even longer since an attractive guy expressed interest in me. I'm still new-ish to this city so I ask my roommate and best friend about him, showing him pics of this guy, and he gives me the all-clear on him.

Fast-forward a couple of weeks and this guy has set up a date with my roommate. Roommate asks me if I'm angry and I tell him I'm angry, jealous and disappointed. He goes on the date anyway and I later get to hear about how they made out. Last night is date #2 for them and I got to hear them banging away.

I already feel pretty shitty about myself and the interest this guy showed in me made me feel like maybe I'm not such a hideous [wildebeast of a man](http://imgur.com/jzDqw90) after all. And this situation has just shredded that bit of confidence I received. I have to say that I feel pretty low. I was trying to have another guy come over for company ... I'm not really attracted to him and, worse, I know I'm his second choice. But I figured I'm really lonely and desperate for human contact (last time I had any was in April) ... and he backed out. So feel even lower now ... I wish I knew what was wrong with me. I know many of you want to say there isn't anything wrong with me, that this is on those other guys for passing me up, but rejection after rejection after rejection really has me believing that there's some serious defect with who I am and no one is telling me about.

Next time I get paid from my new job I'm going to hire an escort if there are any male ones in the city by then. I will pay for it because I just want to be with someone, even just to cuddle. I need to feel wanted, even if it's just for money.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys,&lt;/p&gt;
