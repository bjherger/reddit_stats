Apologies for the text wall.

I've been living with my roommate in college for the past two years now, and this whole time we've gotten along great. He was one of the first people I came out to, and surprisingly turns out he was gay as well. Over this time we've become basically best friends, and he's one of the few people that I feel I can truly rely on to always be there.

There have been times when drunk where we've kind of barely cuddled (not on a bed, just like on a couch), but it's never gone past that, and while it felt good we just never took it further. Well lately the whole roommate dynamic changed when he told me that he really had a crush on me. At the time, I told him that I really appreciated him telling me, but I didn't think I felt the same way. Now, I'm uncomfortable even being in the same room with him, and our conversations always feel forced. 

I was 100% convinced that I didn't feel the same way about him until suddenly one night at a bar I saw him making out with another guy, probably within 30 minutes of cornering me against a wall and telling me that he still liked me (he didn't realize I saw this). As soon as I saw them making out, I'm not exactly sure what I felt, but the closest thing I could say is jealousy/hurt/confusion. I still don't feel physically attracted to him, but I do feel some sort of emotional attraction. I honestly don't know what to do. I feel like such a shitty person, because I already told him I don't like him, so of course he has every right to be doing things with other people. But at the same time, as crazy as it sounds, it feels weird to me for him to be hooking up with someone immediately after telling me they like me. I don't think I should tell him how I feel, because I hate the idea of becoming the type of person who would just string him along or tell him what he can/can't do. And lastly I just don't know if I want my very first relationship to be with him. He's literally the first person I've felt I can tell anything to as a friend, and it really scares me that if the relationship didn't work out we probably wouldn't be friends anymore. I'm just so confused, since I'm positive I'm not physically attracted to him, but there still is definitely something else there.

So a close friend of mine, ""Trevor"", shares a lot of my University classes with me. I would describe Trevor's personality as very outgoing, full-on, and sometimes abrasive. But we are really good pals. Together, we had both made a new acquaintance, ""Frank"", in one of our classes and we have all been hitting it off pretty nicely. 

Now, for context, I've only been openly out since January and I had a rough coming out with my family. I am not overtly flamboyant or anything and I have never even mentioned that I am gay to anyone at Uni, let alone indicate anything to suggest it. I am not trying to hide anything, it has just not ever come up and I don't feel like it's something I need to tell people unless they ask, or unless I feel like I can bring it up organically in a conversation.

Anyway, as we were all leaving class today, Frank asked me if I had started on our class assignment at all. I told him that I hadn't, and he asked me if Trevor had, to which I cheekily replied that, knowing him, he probably hasn't either. Trevor interjected and said that of course he had, and then turned to Frank and said ""but of course susan_is_a_snitch hasn't, he's way too busy dating boys! Haha!"". 

Now I don't know if I'm just being oversensitive, but it really irked me that he said that. I feel kind of offended but I can't pinpoint exactly why. It's possible that I feel like it's not his place to bring up *my* sexuality, when it really wasn't relevant - especially in front of a new friend. I don't feel 100% comfortable discussing my sexuality yet... especially after the coming out that I went through with my parents. I'm still very new to being gay and I'm still shy about it all ahaha. But I don't feel like the comment fit the context... he could have used a lot of other reasons as to why I hadn't started the assignment, but he chose to pin-point my sexuality. And it was in a slightly mocking tone as well. I also just feel like it's my right to come out to people when *I* feel comfortable (although Trevor only implied that I was gay, he didn't explicitly say it. Frank could think that Trevor was joking for all I know).

Long story short. My Husband and I are in the middle of a separation, we also have a band/business together and we're separating because he's fallen in love with boy half his age (thats another story in itself). 

  We got into an argument this evening over house chores in which he lost his temper and flat out told me he hates me and that nothing would make him happier to see me dead.  We've been together for 5 years and I've been subject to his verbal abuse for 3 of them. 

  I may not have been the best husband around. But its a new kind of low when someone you love tells you he hates you and wants you dead.

   We leave to go on tour next week (we're in a very popular band together)… 

  So, I have this noose freshly tied, I've kinda failed at life, can't seem to financially get back on my feet (lost my regular means of employment last year and he's had to financially carry me through a lot of the time as I worked to get back on track), I've really lost my will to live… Im really angry and hurt and I want to make him eat his words… How can you say those sorts of things to someone you love??

For some background, I've had some pretty bad social anxiety issues in the past and don't really get out much.  This year I've decided to change that by going to various meetup groups and getting out more.  It's been going pretty great!  I've made more friends in the last few weeks than I'd made in the last 4 years.  

Anyway, today I went to a gay support group in my city to discuss [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/2z3gk1/how_to_come_out_to_new_friends) issue.  I felt oddly confident...I wore some new clothes that I bought yesterday, and just got a haircut.  About halfway through the meeting, this cute guy walked in and I was totally eyeing him.  I think he noticed and it seemed like he was eyeing me too, but I wasn't really sure due to low self-esteem.  

After these meetings I usually leave pretty quickly because I get nervous about talking to people, but since I felt oddly confident, I decided to stay and go to dinner with the group.  On our way downstairs, the guy I was eyeing earlier tapped me on the shoulder and asked, ""Hey, I don't think I've met you before.  What's your name?""  I wasn't the only new person there so I thought it was odd that he only talked to me.  

We talked for about 15 minutes before heading out and I asked him if he was going to the restaurant where the rest of the group went.  He said he wasn't going since he wasn't hungry, but when I said I was going, he said he'd come.  We spent about an hour at the restaurant with the group and then everyone decided to split in various directions.  I asked him what way he was going and then when I told him what way I was going, he said he'd walk with me even though it was a mile in the opposite direction for him!  

So he drops me off at my door (I was pretty flattered that he went totally out of his way to walk me home!) and then when we said bye I wasn't really sure whether to wave or handshake or hug haha.  I think he could tell I wasn't sure how to say bye so he said, ""Hug?  I like hugs!""  We hugged (which felt pretty awesome) and then he asked if I'd be coming to the meetup next week.

So I'm not sure if this guy is just being overly friendly or if he's into me.  What do you think?

**TL;DR: Crossed paths with someone interesting but didn't do anything about it and just let it go. Wondering if this was a common occurrence for other bros; if not, what ended up happening?**


**Story Time**

I just got back from a trip to California and was flying back to the East Coast. Originally I'm sitting with a friend, but he is split up with his significant other, so I get up and trade seats so that they're together. Turns out I'm in the middle (luckily I'm not too large) between a tall cute guy and a guy who is completely passed out (before we even taxi). 

Hereafter, cute guy will be referred to as Ω (yup, I'm a nerd--deal with it). So Ω and I are sitting next to each other for a 6-ish hour flight (red-eye), yet neither of us says a thing to the other. At this point you're thinking ""okay, that's completely normal. Who wants to talk to a random stranger on a plane anyways?"" Except here's the thing Ω and I are of similar ages since we're both college students (gleaned from his college apparel and other identifying things). Also, we both stayed up the entire flight (Ω was watching movies, I was reading). What is the likelihood that two people in a flight of 100+ will be seated together who cannot sleep? (*Okay smartasses, I know it's less than 2%*) 

Anyways, I we occasionally glance at each other's entertainment during the flight: I saw him watching *The Theory of Everything* and *Miss Congeniality*; he saw me reading *The New Yorker* and *The Castle*. He gave me a weird look when I pulled out a bar of chocolate during the middle of the flight. When he got up to go to the bathroom, I did too such that I avoided the awkward interaction of forcing him to get up before he found it necessary. 

Now it's a couple of hours later and I'm regretting my lack of communication. Chances are Ω isn't gay/bi and isn't interested in me, but there was some chance of conversation based on his film choices (and perhaps my reading). Now I feel like I missed a connection with another human.

 Am I ridiculously romanticizing what would have probably been a short, courteous interaction? Do these missed connections actually mean anything? Has anyone done the opposite of what I did in the situation, and if so, how did that end up? 

P.S. Survey is now closed. I'm working slowly on compiling the data (914 responses!!). Hopefully will have preliminary graphs up by the weekend. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I apologize in advance if this is not the right location for this post. &lt;/p&gt;

I've used dating websites, apps, even a few specific posts on craigslist - all of this with different profile content, both mentioning and not mentioning my kinks and preferences. What has come out of that is dozens of bad dates, flaking, people constantly trying to hook up with me for anal/oral sex only, and all around just a bunch of wasted time.

I get that finding someone to be with takes time and is difficult, but, as much as I hate speaking in absolutes, it seems like the men in my area (Dallas &amp; the metroplex) who have an online presence are only looking for oral or anal sex, which I do not enjoy. As I mentioned in the title, I am into wrestling and frottage, and I also prefer slightly to very overweight men (would say ""Bears"" but that excludes the hairless and possibly senior men). I've also got an online presence in gay wrestling communities, but they are primarily active in the east coast.

So anyways, I don't think this is probably an issue with me being unattractive - I am quite young (still in college), in good shape from daily exercise, and employed. The thing is, I do get attention online, but people disengage when they ask and find out that I'm not into anal/oral.

Thus the big question right now is what I should do about this frustration, because at this point I am spinning my wheels trying to meet with people that ""get"" me. I know that I am completely gay, but having tried conventional sex and not enjoyed it, I feel like I'm something else entirely at this point and I'm afraid that I'll never meet someone I'm sexually compatible with. I try doing things other people enjoy, but even if I like them, it's just... it doesn't do anything for me at all. Sigh - this isn't something I've spoken about with someone before, so it's hard to express this. I'm not the only one with these problems, right?

Admittedly, there are a few minor factors which are quite unjustified, such as that it is seen as abnormal and hence 'weird' to the average person, and that I struggle to find the ideal guy because my type is already quite limiting - gay and chubby (and ideally bearded, masculine and around my age range of 18 to 25).

However, there are also some pretty annoying and confusing causes of my distress. I kind of get grossed out by bigger guys at the same time as being sexually attracted to them.

This is the same for me for fat guys, moobs, bellies, thighs, arms, everything kind of grosses me out but still can turn me on. Even worse, when it comes to the conventionally disgusting things (like dicks and asses) I'm pretty much never turned on by these and am almost always grossed out by them, which I don't really think is normal or healthy (surely at some point they should turn me on else I'm just going to have a really boring and difficult sex life).

It's becoming more common to find a roommate online than to let one be randomly selected by the school. This allows you to actually find someone you will get along with. 

My concern is finding a roommate. I'm from a nice liberal town in Massachusetts but my college is out the Midwest (Ohio) and not to stereotype unintentionally but from what I hear out east, is that it's much less friendly to gays in Midwest so I don't want a random guy. 

The typical way students find roommates is through facebook group posts. However, I'm sure that a post saying ""gay guy looking for a roommate"" is (understandably) unlikely to turn up many guys who would choose a gay guy as a roommate over alternatives. 

I guess my question is how should I approach this? Should I try to find people then tell them later? Not tell my roommate? Leave it to chance?  Just bite the bullet and hope my post would still turn up results? I'm not a very socially adept person, so maybe I'm just overthinking this.

It's been a long time since I've posted on here, but I still check in from time to time to see what's up. I'm looking to get some help from this fine community once again. 

I've really noticed a marked increase in my anxiety when it comes to dating over the last 6-months or so. Specifically first dates. I mean they are pretty anxiety inducing in general, but for the majority of people out there they can refocus this energy or get past it. I don't seem to be able to anymore. 

It's obviously really affecting my dating life as I end up cancelling dates very last minute, ultimately leaving the guy thinking I blew them off. On the reverse, I'm under the impression if I communicate my anxiety disorder, the guy will blow me off because of the stigma surrounding mental health/""who wants to be with a nut-job?""

After I cancel, the guilt sets in furthering the cycle of anxiety. It doesn't help that I myself am a counselling-psychology student as I start to over analyze everything concerning my own mental health and the situation at hand. 

I have had some pretty bad dates over these last 6 months that's correlated with my rise in anxiety and I guess I just feel like what's the point of dating? But thoughts of ""forever alone"" are worse, which pushes me back into attempting to date. For the record, I'm not a relationship Queen, I'm not pining after a bf, and by no means want to force something just because. Hell I can't even get to that point because I can't even meet them haha. 

This situation just happened again, which is why I'm posting this now. I felt like I needed to reach out to a supportive community while I arrange some professional counselling services. If anyone else has felt the same, or has some tools to deal with anxiety regarding dating I'd love to hear them.

I feel very conflicted.

I need to ask him about boundaries and PDA and all things like that because though we've talked *around* the topic of identity and whether he sees himself with a guy long-term, we haven't talked about it directly and it is a very sensitive topic for him.

I would not be spending the time I have on him if I didn't think it was worth it, so let's operate as though it is and he's coming around.

So please, tell me, especially if you've worked through this yourself or with a partner: how should I go about bringing up this topic in a sensitive way?  How do I tell him he should feel free to talk about his feelings on self-discovery and acceptance with me without being so blunt?

Thoughts?

Today, I am coming out as a bottom. I have been carrying a heavy load of shame around this for years and today I am letting it go!! I have read a couple 'bottom shame' threads here and was happy to discover a much healthier exchange of ideas than Scruff or Grindr would lead one to believe exists out there and thats great.

Like all healthy humans I posses both masculine and feminine traits but I really enjoy being a dude and I happen to be someone who is outwardly quite 'masculine'. So It has taken me a long time to fully accept and integrate my 'receptive' sexuality because this always seemed to be at odds with my masculine identity. I was so deeply in denial about this that I thought I was versatile and just struggling with ED issues after several frustrated attempts to top. This just added to my sexual shame until the whole idea of sex with partners lost a lot of its appeal, how sad!

But the story doesn't end there (thank $&amp;^*!). Coming to this point in my sexuality forced me to take an honest look at what I really wanted out of sex. A big part of this integration process has been realizing that everything I thought I knew about 'being a man' had been formed around ideas I had absorbed from the culture. Surprise surprise... If this sounds a bit cliché, that's because it is. The challenge of resisting the claims, values and ideas of our social environment in order to free ourselves to express our own truths is arguably the essential challenge in life for almost everyone on the planet.

So, if you've been a self-shaming bottom, hear this: Your personal and sexual power lies in your ability to 100%, completely, OWN and assert who you are. Denying and resisting who you are only weakens your potency. Instead, trust that you can step FULLY into yourself and you will become a powerful expression of musky, magnetic, red hot masculine energy.

Sharing my thoughts and experience with this and hope it will help anyone else out there who's working through similar shit. Thanks!
