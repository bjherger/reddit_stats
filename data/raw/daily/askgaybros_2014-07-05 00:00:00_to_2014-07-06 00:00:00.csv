To premise this post I think I should lay out a bit of background.  I posted on this forum about a year ago about my inability to meet or date other gay men.  For those curious you can read these posts in my history.  This post is not intended as an update, though I suppose it is in a sense.  Since last year I have managed to achieve interactions and dates.  This has come with many pleasures but also many frustrations, most especially the fact that all my interactions have all either fizzled out (anticlimactically if not acrimoniously) or blown up in my face.  As yet none has blossomed into anything close to a relationship, though I feel I have made some friends.  That frustration is a different, though perhaps not unrelated issue to what I want to ask about here.  Namely what do you guys think is acceptable in terms of misleading people about the level of sexual pleasure you feel in bed.  I am not talking about honestly regarding STD’s or  other partners, but more specifically about levels of sexual pleasure and arousal.

The best way I can illustrate it to relate an experience.  After I became sexually active, the large majority of the guys I met explicitly asserted that they really enjoyed the experience.  Indeed most spoke in terms of our time in bed being the most intense and pleasurable experience they had had.  Although I am aware this may just be courtesy (or even worse manipulation of some sort) the refrain seemed to uniform from to many different guys to be explained away.  Explicitly saying they had an amazing time was ever only a tiny part of the indication they had a good time, their non verbal moans, muscle spasms, trembling and repeated ejaculations seemed to corroborate these claims.

I don’t know what term is used but I am very much turned on by the idea of giving the other guy pleasure.  Not that I neglect my own physical needs or anything, just that I really enjoy it when the other guy is beside himself in ecstasy.  Every guy is different and I tend to take a very analytical approach, surveying the body with my hands and finding out where their pleasure and erogenous zones are and how best to stimulate them with as much eye contact and situation appropriate sex talk as possible.   Although one can never be 100% certain of how other people feel, I am as confident as I can reasonably be that by and large the guys I have been with had a rewarding experience.  This isn’t to suggest everyone reacted this way, because some certainly did not.  I’ll be the first to admit my relative lack of experience, and perhaps my ability to judge people’s reactions is not developed enough to be very certain about how people actually feel.  However the large majority seemed to have a very positive experience.  

However a few months ago I met a guy where I had to question this.  In bed he began moaning in a loud over the top fashion, before I had really learned anything about his preferences.  I found this extremely patronizing and asked him to stop which he did.  As the evening progressed I thought we had a good time.  The next day he was polite by much more tepid than the night in bed had led me to expect.  It was a shock because I had thought things went very well and he said things were only so so and that he misrepresented his degree of sexual pleasure, “for my benefit”.  As somebody who wants the other guy to have a good time this was upsetting.  I don’t have some magic ability to please guys.  In order to do so I have to have honest reactions to what’s going on.  If something isn’t working I want to know so that I can try something else.  If something IS working I also want to know so that I can develop that action more.  By being disingenuous about his level of pleasure he completely thwarted my attempts to please him (well not completely since he came twice, but honestly a guy can do that on his own with no help so it doesn’t prove all that much).  He very candidly defended being dishonest, since to his mind it was for my benefit.  I have had other guys who did not have a great time, but they were up front about it.  I didn’t leave thinking “wow, that was amazing”.   It was a shock to hear the next day that he was not satisfied.  He even chided me for not interpreted some of his subtle reactions.   I was curious how I was supposed to pick up on such subtle hints when he admits to purposely misleading me (again for my own good).  

So my questions are, how accepted is this type of coddling?  Are there good ways to detect it?   Doesn’t it interfere with trying to actually have a good time?  I found it patronizing and insulting, but perhaps others do not view it so negatively as me.  I doubt it could be tested empirically, but does anyone have any anecdotal evidence how common this is and under what circumstances people do it?  I cannot imagine that anyone ALWAYS fakes pleasure so I am curious in what circumstances they do and in which circumstances are they more honest?    

Thanks

2) Fall in love for the first and only time with next-door neighbor, who is openly gay.

3) We get in an argument a few days after we both confess we like each other and started seeing each other. He decides he wants out because he's hurt. I had told him I wasn't ready for anything sexual yet so if he had needs it would be understandable for me if he went with someone else. Crass, I know, but I didn't want him to get frustrated with me.

4) He is a member of my circle of friends who happen to all live down the street. So I have to see him if I want to not be 100% alone.

5) Starts going out with someone else but still sends me mixed messages when things get rough with their relationship. 

6) Tells me he's been thinking about us a lot and that you don't know what you have until it's gone. I try not to believe him because he does this thing where he'll beat around the bush and insinuate that he still likes me (e.g., tell me how cute I look, tell me he wants to go skinny-dipping, sleep over at my house) and then tell me he meant it as a friend whenever I ask him what his intentions are. He sends me on this constant roller coaster of building up expectations only to be let down.

7) He contacts me while I'm away on a trip and says he'd like to talk like we used to, and tells me he wants to know how my coming out is going. I ask him how his love life is going, and he tell me there's absolutely nothing going on. I try to keep distant, but one thing leads to another and he's sending intimate pictures of him and I of me. He makes plans with me for when I return (sleeping over at my house, asking me to give him a massage, going skinny-dipping together) I get my hopes up.

8) When I return back from my trip, I go on his twitter, which I had not visited in months, only to confirm he still is, and has been for a very long time, very much infatuated with his ex and seeing him from time to time.

9) I ask him if he still likes his ex and he says ""of course!"". I ask him what I am to him, and he says only a friend and that's the way it's always been. I ask him why the fuck he was sexting me and he says he did it because he thought it was silly and to have a few laughs between friends. I confront him about it and tell him it really hurts me. He says it's all in my head but nonetheless he'll change his behavior around me, but I can't keep up the friendship thing. It's devastating.

10) I had gotten over the fact we aren't together, and I still care for him, but he says I'm selfish for cutting contact once I saw him and his ex (who he had told me he wasn't seeing anymore a week prior) leave his house together.

11) I think he cares for me deeply as a friend, at least, and even though I know cutting contact has hurt him, his actions have fucked me up beyond words. I've told him so and he said he would change the way he behaves towards me, but I can't get over the fact he has led me on so many times and that now he's with his ex, who seems to be a nice guy with a smooth voice and kind way about him. It makes me physically sick.

12) He's making me feel like the bad guy for cutting contact with him. I didn't do it out of hatred or animosity, but out of a desire to isolate myself from this whirlwind of pain. I get that he thinks he's my friend, but I can't subject myself to this any longer.

TL;DR never go out with a neighbor. Any tips for moving past this?

English is my second language so let me cut to the chase.  

Long story short, I'm a 22 years old guy, I have no experience at all when it comes to sex or even any form of intimate relationship with a man or a woman.  
I don't want to identify myself as gay yet, but i'm pretty sure it's where i'm going to end.  

I sick of my situation and I want to break the ice by hooking up with a guy that understands my situation and ok with it.  
Tonight I downloaded Grindr and even though I don't have a profile picture yet, several guys started chatting with me and I had a good time.  
I know Grindr can be a dangerous place and being a really shy guy who is absolutely terrified of being recognized since i'm not out about being curious to anyone I am very careful with it.

Now the questions are:  
- Am I being naive thinking I could find a guy that would be ok going through this kind of experience ?  
- I am aware of the danger regarding STD, I will not under any circumstances have unprotected anal sex but shall I use a condom for oral sex ? I know, better safe than sorry but i've never heard of someone using a condom for a blowjob and I think it would be (and taste) really weird ...  

If you want to share a similar story, go for it.  
If there is something you'd like to ask me, go for it.  
If you have any advice you'd want to give, go for it.

We went out for about a month, had lots of fun but unfortunately broke up. The reason being was he wanted an open relationship and I at the time didn't want that. Commence sadness (of course lol) nothing serious, I mean, it's been a while since then so I was awesome for six months, you know, focused on school, hung out with friends, classic getting over a break up stuff.

HOWEVER, recently he contacted me saying he was near my area and wanted to know where I lived, since he apparently forgot. Being such a long time since we talked I was kinda skeptical but I eventually gave in and told him where I lived. He came over for a bit, we went for a walk, hung out for a couple of hours, and just caught up. Overall, it was good, though (and here's the first problem) I didn't know what the intention of the visit was. I couldn't tell if he wanted to be friends or maybe that he wanted to go out once more, so I asked him if he wanted to hang out again soon, and so I could get to the bottom of this.

A week goes by, and we make the plans to hang out, go for a walk, grab some food, and basically chill. I try not to read too much into the smiley faces that he puts into his texts (dammit brain) but you know how the mind works. Anyways, we eventually hang out and it's great, lots of fun had, but I found a flirtatious undertone to the whole evening, so I was thinking ""Okay, this HAS to be a date, but be ready in case it's not."" Of course I was too chicken to ask and also, I admit, a little afraid if he said it wasn't but I'll get to that later. So we finish eating, head home, hug goodbye, and that was it. I get back home and told him I forgot to thank him for the food (since he paid) and then made a little joke. We text briefly then I realize I gotta ask. If I don't this is gonna drive me nuts. So I do. I ask him if it was a date because I got a date vibe. He tells me he doesn't know and to call it whatever, but either way he had fun. THEN he says if I was hoping things to go further then I should know that he still wants an open relationship. I took this as ""No, it wasn't a date, and we should just be friends"" and so I told him that's cool, I just wanted to know what was up. Then I cried. Yup, I've been good for about six months but now it felt like a break up again. Luckily at this point, I've learned to deal with heavy emotions, which for me, is playing music and just letting it all happen. So I cry it out and and the next day I feel so much better, but I realize I need to do something about this.

At this point I realized the things I did wrong. I knew I should've been clear right off the bat if it was a date or not. That could've saved me so much grief. I would've been fine being friends had that been established as the intent but I secretly hoped that he had wanted to get together and so that's why I didn't ask, and in the end I ended finding myself liking this guy all over again. The next day I realized that I need to have a peace of mind so I decided to come up with a list of options. **Option** **1**, I tell him that I don't think we can be friends cause in the end I'll always have romantic feelings and that's just no fun. **Option** **2** is to wait it out and realize that I've gotten over him before and maybe I can do it again and while it may be a lengthy process, it's still viable. AND FINALLY **OPTION** **3** (and this is where it gets interesting) is that we get back together. What I finally realized (after talking about it with some peeps) is that he didn't actually say that it WASN'T a date and then gave me the option to continue if I was groovy with it. But also you're probably thinking, ""Yo man, you guys broke up cuz you wanted different things. How can you expect to date him knowing that?"" and I hear you. But like I said, it's been a while, and in that period I've slept around casually and have gotten used to sex as something  that can be more open (only if done safe tho lol) and so now I'm at a point where I'd say I wouldn't actively seek an open relationship but I don't think it will bother me having one. However, an issue that I have is that I hope this change isn't stemming from wanting to be with him and is secretly overriding any form of logic to enter my mind, and that eventually I won't be okay with an open relationship (risky way of knowing for sure though). 

Anyways, I've been hoping to get some opinions so I've been opening up to some of my friends about this as well as hopefully get some opinions from you guys. And although I wouldn't mind any of the options I've laid out, I guess I am more partial to getting back together but I way prefer having a peace of mind and do what's healthy for me. But who knows, we dated only for a month and maybe I'm being *waaaay* to dramatic, in the end another problem could possibly arise that ends it all (gotta be realistic, right?). So lemme know what you guys think I should do.

So I'm having some concerns, and I'm looking for advice. The guy I'm currently seeing has always been very sweet to me while we've been dating and for the most part, I really enjoy being with him. Certainly, he's a bit of an ass on occasion, but his arrogance is a part of his charm, I think.

But to the point, a friend of mine that I used to date two years ago came to me and told me about a date that he went on with my now-current boyfriend a few months ago. From what he said, it definitely sounds like my boyfriend got him very drunk to have sex, and he says he definitely would not have slept with him if he hadn't been so drunk. My friend was very ""if you like him, don't let what I'm saying affect you,"" but I can't really do that, like, at all.

I don't really know what I should do with this info. I don't feel very comfortable being around my boyfriend at the moment, and I know that if I confront him, he'll find some way to talk his way out, or start way too much conflict for my friend, and I don't want to open him up to that.

So yeah, I'm open to any advice. I'm sorry I can't get into more specifics, but that's the gist of where I'm at. I'm also going to be moving away from the area in a month, so I'm not sure how much drama I really want to fit into my schedule.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;m having some concerns, and I&amp;#39;m looking for advice. The guy I&amp;#39;m currently seeing has always been very sweet to me while we&amp;#39;ve been dating and for the most part, I really enjoy being with him. Certainly, he&amp;#39;s a bit of an ass on occasion, but his arrogance is a part of his charm, I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But to the point, a friend of mine that I used to date two years ago came to me and told me about a date that he went on with my now-current boyfriend a few months ago. From what he said, it definitely sounds like my boyfriend got him very drunk to have sex, and he says he definitely would not have slept with him if he hadn&amp;#39;t been so drunk. My friend was very &amp;quot;if you like him, don&amp;#39;t let what I&amp;#39;m saying affect you,&amp;quot; but I can&amp;#39;t really do that, like, at all.&lt;/p&gt;

I don&amp;#39;t feel very comfortable being around my boyfriend at the moment, and I know that if I confront him, he&amp;#39;ll find some way to talk his way out, or start way too much conflict for my friend, and I don&amp;#39;t want to open him up to that.&lt;/p&gt;
