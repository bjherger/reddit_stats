My names Charlie and I'm 18, straight and from Australia. 

I'm a college student/struggling musician/waiter.

From what I've heard, every gay guy has that inevitable ""straight guy crush"".

Well, my friend (Jamie) has this happening to me.

I look after my body and try to look my best, and Jamie is one of my best friends.

He came out three years ago, and I've been 100% supportive and open to his sexuality, as have all our friends since then. 

Last year, he confessed to me that he had ""very strong feelings"" towards me, in the hopes that I would reciprocate his feelings, which I didn't, and I politely but with certainty told him. Since then, I thought it died off, but his feelings are still there.

My friendship with all my friends (straight and gay) has always been very hands-on and touchy feely I guess. Like, I'll tell my mates I love em, and we spoon sometimes, I'm not ashamed. We're very open, seen each other naked and stuff, we're all very close, Jamie included.

I think Jamie really perceives these actions to be of a flirtatious manner, and recently I felt very cruel for ""teasing"" him like that.

The other day, we were both really drunk, he went yolo and went in for the kiss. I wasn't in my mind and I kinda let it happen and he was on top of me, sucking my mouth, grabbing at my crotch, for about 10-15 seconds before I got up. I didn't blame him or anything, he was intoxicated and I was looking top-notch that night.

I just don't know what to do or whether or not I need to change my behaviour around him, or if I need to just tell him again more bluntly that I'm not interested or just idk give some space between us? Am I a bad person for leading him on with my ""flirty"" nature?

I guess I just want to know, if you were in Jamies position (some of you may have been), how would you want Charlie (me) to deal with it?
Also yeah I'm happy to talk to you guys or answer questions I'm pretty new to reddit though :)



*Maybe I should just get uglier... ayyy?*

I REPEAT THE BLAZING CROTCH HAS BEEN DOWSED. 

Thanks to all you top fellas for your stories and remedies! I followed their with some medicated ointment and have had no ill effects and gave soothed the burning nuts. The chemical burn is minimal thank fuck. No major problems. 



So long story short:  I put hair removal creme on my balls.  Balls now have chemical burn.  Great balls of fire.  HALP!

Short story - long:  So I thought I'd do some maintainance to my junk area did my usual trim and blah blah blah and needed to shave my nuts. 

 My partner bought some Nair for himself and used it on his chest with no problems.  So here I am thinking, shit this must be great!  Don't have to take a set of razors to my balls, and proceed to liberally slather them in this toxic wonder creme.  I quickly skim the package for instructions, leave  in for no more than 10min.  Rinse.  Pat dry.  Cool.  

6 minutes pass, ooh is that a tingling I feel?  Yes, but it's not too bad  8 minutes, okay this is getting to be rather uncomfortable. 
8.5 minutes, holy mother of fuck my balls burn.  I run for the shower and hose down my crotch whilst calling for my bf to come into the bathroom so I can tell him his magic creme is a chemical weapon and he should be arrested for crimes against humanity.  

He comes in and I show him my nuts now wrinkly and red and sore and burning.  And still covered in ball hair.  He laughs his ass off, I grab a bag of pees and sit buck ass naked on the couch with pees on my crouch.

It's now 3 hours after the incident and my nuts are still burning.  Aloe burns worse, as does burn creme.  Anyone else have some ideas on wtf I can put on my dumb ass nuts to stop the fuckers from burning?

Been squatting in the office without my boss or my colleagues knowing, because I have recently been kicked out of the house by my ex. Slightly over a month ago, we decided to break up after almost a year and a half of non-stop arguing, jealousy and petty fights. He destroyed my laptop, took my passport, threw it down the toilet and peed on it. A few weeks later he decided it would be best to leave me stranded outside of the house, and he didn't even let me pack my stuff. This happened at 4am, after I went out drinking with my friends.

Honestly I have been handling it quite well, even surprised myself too. Most people would probably freak out by now.

I have a car, so most times I just sleep there and shower at the gas station. I would sneak into my office after everyone's left, but none of them actually knew I sometimes sleep here, under my desk.

Same routine that's been happening for well over a year now. It's incredibly painful to type this, because I've been beating myself up about this ever since I came out. 

I'm affectionate. I have no problem cuddling/displaying affection. However, I have never really been into sex. Full disclosure, I've been diagnosed with mild depression and General Anxiety Disorder. I'm on Lexapro. And my doctor/shrink recommended I go off Lexapro and try Xanax. I told him ""No"" - because it seems like that would be like prescribing heroin to a person who wants to get off cocaine. 

I have no problems getting myself off solo. And I'm extremely hesitant about doing this routinely, because I want to at least be ready for when the moment strikes when I'm with my bf. However, after a year, that moment hasn't really materialized. 

I have no problem getting my boyfriend to climax. I go to a ""talk"" therapist, and she rightfully diagnosed that ""if he's satisfied, that's probably all he cares about"" (she didn't say this in a malicious way). However, I've just never been into the act. I've towed the line between bisexual and gay, and really, it's been the case for both genders. 

I've been trying to figure out my problem. However, when I Google ""Gay men who aren't into sex"" - the results come up pretty minimal. I would love to say it's a religious thing, or some sort of self-hatred thing. But it's not. I'm proud to call myself gay (or bi). I'm fully out. I have no problem satisfying my boyfriend. However, given the choice, I'd prefer to just fall asleep in his arms as opposed to doing it 'til the break of dawn. 

I've taken a blood test, and there's no ""low-T"" going on. I do know that I tend to keep long hours at work, so exhaustion is an issue. I would almost recommend a ""meatless Monday"" style approach, where the expectation of NOT having sex would actually calm down my anxiety enough to make me more likely to get in the mood. 

Anyway - to anyone who's reading - thanks for taking the time to glance over this. It sucks when even your psychiatrist (who's gay) has no answers for you. He keeps telling me ""you have to get out of your head and get in the moment."" I told him ""that's like telling a manic depressive to just cheer up."" I'm coming to him to get answers for that exact type of dilemma. 

","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s about 11:30 p.m., and I&amp;#39;m about ready to go to my boyfriend&amp;#39;s house now to sleep over. Same routine that&amp;#39;s been happening for well over a year now. It&amp;#39;s incredibly painful to type this, because I&amp;#39;ve been beating myself up about this ever since I came out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m affectionate. I have no problem cuddling/displaying affection. However, I have never really been into sex. Full disclosure, I&amp;#39;ve been diagnosed with mild depression and General Anxiety Disorder. I&amp;#39;m on Lexapro. And my doctor/shrink recommended I go off Lexapro and try Xanax. I told him &amp;quot;No&amp;quot; - because it seems like that would be like prescribing heroin to a person who wants to get off cocaine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no problems getting myself off solo. And I&amp;#39;m extremely hesitant about doing this routinely, because I want to at least be ready for when the moment strikes when I&amp;#39;m with my bf. However, after a year, that moment hasn&amp;#39;t really materialized. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no problem getting my boyfriend to climax. I go to a &amp;quot;talk&amp;quot; therapist, and she rightfully diagnosed that &amp;quot;if he&amp;#39;s satisfied, that&amp;#39;s probably all he cares about&amp;quot; (she didn&amp;#39;t say this in a malicious way). However, I&amp;#39;ve just never been into the act. I&amp;#39;ve towed the line between bisexual and gay, and really, it&amp;#39;s been the case for both genders. &lt;/p&gt;

I am a high school senior now. I have had a best friend that I met freshman year that I kind of had a crush on but got over it because he was obviously straight. We have hung out at each others houses, gone to movies, had family get-togethers, and slept over at each others houses. We are practically brothers, when it comes to us being best friends.

A little over a month ago he told me that he was bi. He also told me that he has had experience with guys. I will admit, I have had experiences with guys too, but never something emotional. After he told me this, my crush on him came back, even bigger this time, since I now know that he is bi. I then told him I was bi too.

Here is my problem. He has a girlfriend that he has been dating for a long time. Want to hear something even worse? She is manipulating him without him even knowing it. I hate her. There, I said it. His parents hate her too. But he is totally in love with her without even knowing the things that she is doing. I, and his parents, have hinted at all of these things to him and he has told me he still believes that he should be with her. I respect his opinion, and as his friend, I let him do what he believes is best for him without judgement. We have a very open friendship where we will literally tell each other everything. I have known his parents for years and they are practically my parents as well. They have always told  me how they felt about my decisions openly and I have told them things that I would never tell my own parents in a million years and they have told me, in discussion, how they feel, without judgement. They have told me and my friend, and my sibling, and my friend's sibling that they will love and support us through the thick and thin, no matter what.

Here's where it gets even better. I'm still in the closet, and even though his parents love anyone unconditionally, he thinks differently because of what his gf has led him to believe. He has decided not to tell his parents. He is the first guy that I am emotionally attracted to as well. I think I love him, but now on a totally different level.

There is much more that I can't even put into this post without my hands cramping from writing it all.

On top of all of that I'm questioning my career goals (I'm 23 and in grad school but thinking of dropping out) and I live with my parents (who would not be very happy if I quit school) So I guess my question is do you think there is any hope for me to meet any new people?

Like all of us, I love receiving blowjobs. And if possible, go as deep as i can till like mid throat so that causes a lot of contact area.

Last year was the first time I went after itching on the tip of my penis for quite some time, and was given antibiotics just in case. All tests were negative. 

After another incident, I had white discharge after 2 days or so. Got tested, all negative. 

I have been tested 5 or 6 times last year all with the same symptom (some white discharge if milked out a day to 3 days after receiving oral) and all always came negative. I was given antibiotics and the discharge was gone a day after. 

About a month ago I went for a central American vacation and again received oral a day before the flight. When I went to my hotel I had the most discharge ever and got freaked out. Couldn't go to the doctor or anything. The amount then decreased dramatically, to nothing by the time I was able to see my doctor again 2 weeks after in the US. He took samples for sti and culture test. He doesn't know what is happening but again I got my antibiotics. All tests came negative again. I love that fact, don't get me wrong but this discharge 2 days after receiving head thing is getting really old.

This worked out until about three days ago, I was on my aunt's house to spend Christmas with my family and her and I decided I'd check on Grindr because I was kinda bored and this dude messaged me and we started talking.  
  
He seems actually pretty cool and we exchanged numbers and have been talking since and now he's been talking about meeting up but I've been refusing with random excuses, it seems that he's still interested in me since we still do talk and I feel like he's a good person, I'm honestly attracted to him but I'm pretty scared since I'm really new to all this stuff and I can't help it but worry I'm gonna disappoint him.  
  
What should I do?

  


UPDATE: I've actually just finished talking with him. I told him about still being new and that he'd be the first person I'd plan on meeting up and that I felt like I wouldn't live up to his expectations but he said that I had nothing to worry about and if I wanted we could continue talking until I was confident enough to want to meet him and after that he apologized for being a bit forceful.

So basically I had one date with a guy during Thanksgiving and we agreed that we'd see each other again. We talked periodically between then and now, but recently I'm questioning whether he's still interested in going out again or not. We were talking about going out to dinner when he suddenly stopped responding. I wished him a merry christmas and he did the same to me, and we haven't said much since.

When it came to texting and everything, I was usually the one who initiated, although he did a couple times as well. While I am still interested in going out with him again, I don't want to push too hard and come off as super clingy because I feel like I already accomplish that by just being me.

Should I ask him about us going out again? Or should I wait a few days and see what he does/doesn't do? I'm awful at texting and playing these games (I prefer to be blunt and straightforward, which unfortunately apparently comes off as clingy in past experiences), and I'm at quite a bit of a loss.

thank you!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey bros,&lt;/p&gt;

I've been bigger than all the guys I've been with (3 in total, so I'm not the most experienced). I just hooked up with a friend whom I thought was straight but turns out to be bi. He's probably a full foot shorter than me and has a below average sized dick. I'm no size queen, generally I like guys with average cocks. My question is, how do you compliment a guy on his cock when it's small? He keeps complimenting me on my piece and he'll just hold it in his hands while we cuddle. I gotta say it makes me feel incredible when he says those things. I want to return the favor.  Maybe it's a bit of ego stroking, but I also really enjoy being the ""big bro"" and cuddling him, feeling protective, and all that. But he's still a masculine guy so I don't want to belittle him or anything. Although he's so into my big dick that maybe he wants to be a little belittled?

I'm guessing cute is off the table? Even though that's what pops into head every time I see his. I really enjoy his cock and our time together. I tell him so. I want to bottom for him eventually. All this interest from me has got to show him that I truly love that small cock of his! Maybe I should just take out the adjectives and just tell him how much I like his dick and what he's doing. But it just feels hollow next to the things he tells me. Although after writing all this out, I think we both kinda like this big bro/little bro thing we've got going on...

I know I should ask him these question and I will but it's the holidays and I won't see him for a while. I thought I'd get y'all's opinion or experiences first.
