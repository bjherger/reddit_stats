We've been dating for a year. My parents found out about me being gay when my mom found a bottle of lube at the foot of my bed while he was over one time and then my dad asked him to leave since we were 'done' with our homework and it was late. He's not allowed over anymore, this was about 6 months ago. 

Part of my me and my bf's recent dispute comes from this other dispute. About a month after my parents found out, my mom takes a week-long trip. I thought I would have my boyfriend over (for sex, obviously) while my dad was at work. My bf and I pick up lunch and we head home, but my sister was arriving. My sister is 17 yo, I told her I'm gay and dating a guy about 5 months into the relationship.

I text her while I'm waiting in the car. She says he can't come over, that she'll be rude and kick him out. She says rules are rules, and I should know he's not allowed. I tell her I did her a favor by allowing her to be out with her then bf in our front yard at 2am; she says she got caught and I can't hold that again her. I tell her her bf was over often, she agreed but said he was allowed to. I confront her in the house and she was also upset that I was taking advantage of my mom being away, by having him over and that it was disrespectful. We ended up just eating lunch at Sonic drive in.

There was no cursing or shouting, most of it was all through text of course and I thought she was being kind of mature but somewhat of a hypocrite since she has had her way by having her bf over just as often as I had mine. She also had sex with some guy she hid from the family, I told this to my bf. That was probably family business I should not have said, but idk. This event was from about six months ago.


Recently, I mentioned that my sister would be coming to the same community college as my bf and I. He says he doesn't like her. I ask why and he says he thinks she's a hypocrite for the things I've told him and that she handled that situation very badly and immaturely. I keep asking and he says he doesn't hate her just really dislikes her, and how he doesn't have to like her. He also said he thinks if I think she was in the right I might have been brainwashed. That last comment was fucked up, that's one thing that bothered me the most. I keep insisting he's not right, he says I'm not listening and we almost ended up not eating out that day. We talk about it the next day and he thinks she had some right, but really didn't like how she handled the situation. He's still strong on his opinion, though.

I read over the texts, and they're pretty tame. I think she was in the right by telling me he can't come over. 

I feel like he's being too opinionated and frustrated we didn't get out way and doesn't like my sister for this. I think he thinks he should have let us in since she doesn't have the right (in a way) to take the high road. What bothered him the most is that she said she would be rude and kick him out, however she said this through text. I want to let him know this, but I don't want to mess things up. I don't think I was brainwashed, but I also think she was kind of being a hypocrite my weaseling her reasoning on how her bf was able to come over, however she was right in not letting us in.

**TD;DR**: Boyfriend strongly doesn't like my sister because she didn't let us come over after it was brohibited and disliked the way she handled the situation, despite her usually being a rude person, however I think she took the high road and handled it well despite her record.

So the story is, I met a guy through a friend of a friend who just happened to be gay, was real shy and stuff but we had common interests (he's part of our gaming/d&amp;d group).  Over time we started talking outside of the gaming group and we where just being friendly and whatnot, I didn't find him attractive and was happy that I made a new friend. 

Over time we started getting more and more personal with our conversation, starting  to get to know each other better and whatnot, eventually I found out he was rather badly depressed, a lot of guys his age are and I'm sure a few of you can relate with just starting uni/collage and wondering what to do in life. Eventually it got to a point where I couldn't help him anymore and I kinda told him we've reached the end of a road and he has to do something to turn it around, this ended up being a good choice and he's actively made changes to lead a happier life and it's really nice to be around him now he's happier. 

This made us even closer, we both know personal things about eachother we wouldn't let others know, things get a little sexy sometimes and we swap pics and whatnot pandering to eachother interests, we go on little mini dates and whatnot, mentally we are on the same level, and he's even comfortable with the weird shit I'm into sexually, he's even got into a little himself. 

Most people would be going ""well hurry up and date this dude!""  and I would love to but it just doesn't feel right and I feel shitty about what I think my reasons are. 

Im more of bigger guy I'm about 87kgs and go to gym regularly, I lead a very active lifestyle witha lot of strength training, i'd say I'm into bears and otters, even chubbier guys and people similar to me, even though I kinda like the idea of a size difference. 

He's I guess you could say a twink, he's real  skinny and whatnot, he's not ugly by any means! I just have a real hard time finding him attractive oversomething silly like body type, and thinking of being with someone like him feels wrong to me for some reason. 

I don't know if it's just because in general I've never been in a relationship, but I feel like shit that I can't shake it.

So this random afternoon I got a message from a picless profile; he sent me some pictures and asked if I was available for lunch. I was pretty hungry that time and was going to get lunch anyway so I said yes. I stated explicitly that I wasn't looking for hookups on my grindr profile btw. I had lunch with him and conversations went pretty well.

He said he would like to meet me again and I said okay, and we parted ways. I then went to the library so that I could use their computers for uni work but unfortunately they were all occupied. Out of desperation I texted him and asked if he had a computer at his place. He said he had one so I went to his.

His computer had his full name on the Windows login screen so that's how I got his full name. Was busy doing my work and after a few hours he came and suggested that I should take a break from work. He brought me to his bedroom and he asked to cuddle and one thing led to another and things just happened. After that I had a shower and went back to my work.

He even made dinner.

After dinner I left his house. His house was just next to a church, which was weird, but no biggie, it's a crowded city, I thought. But just a casual glance at the church's signboard and my heart sank; under the name of the church, it said:

Vicar: Fr [his full name]

That was so fucked up I couldn't believe it at that moment. Immediately googled for more info and found that he has been a clergyman for more than 20 years. [MRW](http://i.imgur.com/ceKmICb.jpg)

Now I am getting a lot of texts from him, I wouldn't mind being just friends but I have a feeling he definitely wants something sexual. What should I do?

Fall semester I was having a rough time, and started to see a therapist. I was diagnosed with depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and social anxiety disorder. At this point I had not begun to address my homosexuality, but it was at some point during this process that I just felt I had to tell someone for whatever reason. I guess talking to someone about important stuff started to ""peel off the layers."" I had always figured I was just going through a phase. But I would lie in bed at night, knowing that this had to come out. So I decided on telling a friend. Now we weren't particularly close, but I wanted to tell someone who was out of my friend circle, in case things got weird. We had started hanging out, and we got along really well. I figured he would take it well. I'm still not sure why I singled him out, but I do know that the first time I saw him last year I thought he was the most attractive guy I'd ever seen. I think part of me wanted him to be gay, not just because of the attraction, but also for the support. I told him everything (the mental illness stuff too) and he was fine with it. He treated me no differently. At all. So fast forward to winter break, and I'm having a really rough time at home. The depression started consuming me. It felt like something was picking at my soul. Throughout this, my main reason for living was him. I loved him, in whatever capacity. I loved him for accepting me, and for treating me no differently, and for wanting to spend time with me even when I hated myself. I got meds and continued therapy during this break, and started to feel better in terms of the depression. Now this semester, I start feeling like he's flirting with me. We had always spent time just the 2 of us, but it felt different. Sometimes I would look at him and it felt like he wanted me to say something, or vice versa. He was always goofy, but he started focusing more on me, and would do things he knew bugged me. We would end up having conversations about nothing for hours. I really hoped he was into me, as I felt that would help me deal with my sexuality. I didn't even feel like it was same-sex attraction. It just felt like love, which was a nice feeling. But, because of the depression, I had felt so alone for so long that I couldn't tell in what capacity I loved him (as a friend or something more). Finally I told him that I liked him and that he was the reason I was able to pull through. I knew it was a lot, I just felt that I had to. He admitted it made him a bit uncomfortable, but that he was fine with it if I was. He's yet to act differently around me. He does have a lot of trouble communicating emotions, as I used to (and still do), but when I shared thoughts of suicide with him, and he sensed things were getting bad, he said ""For whatever reason I don't like compliments, so don't expect me to do this again."" And he said how everybody liked me (obviously he was more specific than that but you get the point) and that ""you're not a burden to me now (as I told him I felt I was), but you would be if you weren't here."" He also said that often social interaction exhausts him, but that there's something about me that lets him go hours talking about nothing and he enjoys it. That meant a lot to me, because I knew I meant something to him. But now I'm having more trouble than ever dealing with the fact that I'm gay or bi. I've never been in a relationship (probably because of this) and I feel that I need to talk to someone who's been through this. Problem is I don't trust many people, which I usually blame on the anxiety and/or depression, and I want to talk to someone who's not flamboyantly gay and who's just dealing with things now, as I feel that their experiences will parallel mine more closely (I don't fit the gay stereotype at all, no one would think that I am). I know of someone who's just coming out, but I don't know him personally. He's a 6'8"" athlete who does not come off as gay at all. We have mutual friends, and apparently he's a nice guy. As of the last few days, the sexuality thing is hitting me hard. I'm ashamed and I'm scared. I'm considering facebook messaging this kid to talk things over with him before the semester ends. I figure he may want someone to talk to too. I know I need some perspective; recently the anxiety has developed into panic attacks, and I feel myself getting more and more uncomfortable.

Disclaimer: this will be a long read.  If you make it the whole way through I hope you can leave a comment with your thoughts.  If not, it was therapeutic to write anyways.

For a long time (months) starting last year I had been crushing HARD on a guy we'll call Matt.  I'd been out for about a year but never really been with anyone else and I was crazy about him and I didn't know what to do.  When I'd see him during the week I'd always try to engage him in conversation (we have a lot of common interests), make him laugh, and generally just get closer to him.  See, no one knew if he was gay or not, his facebook profile said nothing either way but most people that I confided in thought that he was or that I should at least go for it.  Whenever I talked to him I would be silently struggling, wanting to let him know how I feel but never being able to.  I'd go home afterwards feeling like shit and sometimes cry because of how lonely I felt and how angry I was at myself for not being able to breach that topic.  This had continued for a while leading up to the point (again, about a month ago) when we're walking out of class one day and I really just thought to myself ""fuck it"" and so I told him I think we should get dinner some time.

He said yes!

To be honest I was surprised myself, being fully prepared for rejection (and expecting it).  He also accepted the invitation in a way where he sounded confused about the request.  I could tell he didn't get the full implication so I told him that I meant it as a date.  ""Oh.  I'm not..."" was his reply and I found it hard to look at him, knowing fully well what he was trying to say.  Still, I immediately asked him if he was straight, just to be sure and he said that he was.  So I said ""okay, see you around then"" and I left.  Honestly, at the time I was just happy with myself that I was finally, for the first time in my life, able to overcome those walls I had put up around myself and now that I knew for certain that he was unobtainable, I would be able to move on.

Luckily, I didn't have to see Matt for another few days so I was able to recover, at least a little bit.  But I won't lie, since then everything feels different.  He talks to me almost never now and, frankly, I've stopped trying to talk to him too.  The last time I was around him, in the elevator, I didn't even say hi.  I just put on my headphones, put on a mask over my emotions, and stared steadfastly ahead.  He did the same.  I'm not sure if he feels awkward, doesn't want to talk to me, or maybe he never really cared enough to be my friend in the first place and it was just me forcing things and looking for signs that weren't there.  That's how things stand with Matt right now, but... there's another guy.

A few weeks after I asked out Matt I was feeling down on myself and browsing around on Grindr.  I don't know what I was really looking for (definitely not sex) but I really wanted to just be close to someone for once in my life.  I ended up talking to a guy we'll call Chris.  He seemed nice enough, we talked for a bit, and I thought I would give it a shot so I asked him to dinner.  It went alright, we kissed at the end of the date, and, although I wasn't really looking for it, he wanted to have sex with me and I eventually gave in and got him off.  Side note: I have never been able to get off with another person despite the 3 people I have tried with.  Anyways, since that night we've hung out twice more and I've gotten him off again one of those nights.  My friends are excited for me but I don't know if I feel the same way.  When I hang out with him I feel really awkward and anxious.  I'm constantly worrying about what to say to him or how I can get him to laugh but it ends up with me just stuck in my head, unable to say anything at all.  I can't get past the formal stage of just asking him basic questions like what kind of music he likes, what food he likes, etc.  I confided in a friend about this and she just told me I'm not awkward and that I'm overthinking it too much.  Admittedly, I probably am but shouldn't conversation flow naturally?  Shouldn't I not have to try to force things?  This brings us to the subject of this post and thank you if you've read this far.  I thought I was done with my feelings with Matt and I thought I could move on but I think I tried to get involved with someone else too soon.  Last night I was feeling especially sad and crying; I couldn't stop thinking about Matt even though I hadn't in a while.  We had class together yesterday and I guess being around him just set me off.  I know that these feelings I have for him can never go anywhere, it's my responsibility to kill that part of myself, but that doesn't change the fact that I still have them. So I'm meeting with Chris later today and I am going to tell him that I don't think we should see each other.  It isn't fair of me to lead him on when I'm still thinking about another guy and frankly I feel like an asshole for it.  I haven't told my friend that I still have feelings for Matt but I have told her about feeling awkward and unable to talk with Chris and she thinks it's a bad idea for me to end it. I think Chris is a great guy and I'm not saying I don't like him just that it may be impossible right now for me to connect with him in the way he wants to.  So I'm looking for your advice gaybros.  I'm hoping some outside perspective can help.  Should I end things?  If so, should I tell him about Matt or would that just make me an even bigger asshole?  Should I just tell him I don't think we're connecting?  Should I tell him about my anxiety, awkwardness, and self-esteem issues?  I really don't know what to do but in 3 hours I'll have to make up my mind.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alright gaybros, in about 3 hours after this post I think I&amp;#39;m going to end things with a guy I&amp;#39;ve been seeing (only like 3 times so far) but before I do I want some advice.  Disclaimer: this will be a long read.  If you make it the whole way through I hope you can leave a comment with your thoughts.  If not, it was therapeutic to write anyways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a long time (months) starting last year I had been crushing HARD on a guy we&amp;#39;ll call Matt.  I&amp;#39;d been out for about a year but never really been with anyone else and I was crazy about him and I didn&amp;#39;t know what to do.  When I&amp;#39;d see him during the week I&amp;#39;d always try to engage him in conversation (we have a lot of common interests), make him laugh, and generally just get closer to him.  See, no one knew if he was gay or not, his facebook profile said nothing either way but most people that I confided in thought that he was or that I should at least go for it.  Whenever I talked to him I would be silently struggling, wanting to let him know how I feel but never being able to.  I&amp;#39;d go home afterwards feeling like shit and sometimes cry because of how lonely I felt and how angry I was at myself for not being able to breach that topic.  This had continued for a while leading up to the point (again, about a month ago) when we&amp;#39;re walking out of class one day and I really just thought to myself &amp;quot;fuck it&amp;quot; and so I told him I think we should get dinner some time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said yes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest I was surprised myself, being fully prepared for rejection (and expecting it).  He also accepted the invitation in a way where he sounded confused about the request.  I could tell he didn&amp;#39;t get the full implication so I told him that I meant it as a date.  &amp;quot;Oh.  I&amp;#39;m not...&amp;quot; was his reply and I found it hard to look at him, knowing fully well what he was trying to say.  Still, I immediately asked him if he was straight, just to be sure and he said that he was.  So I said &amp;quot;okay, see you around then&amp;quot; and I left.  Honestly, at the time I was just happy with myself that I was finally, for the first time in my life, able to overcome those walls I had put up around myself and now that I knew for certain that he was unobtainable, I would be able to move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, I didn&amp;#39;t have to see Matt for another few days so I was able to recover, at least a little bit.  But I won&amp;#39;t lie, since then everything feels different.  He talks to me almost never now and, frankly, I&amp;#39;ve stopped trying to talk to him too.  The last time I was around him, in the elevator, I didn&amp;#39;t even say hi.  I just put on my headphones, put on a mask over my emotions, and stared steadfastly ahead.  He did the same.  I&amp;#39;m not sure if he feels awkward, doesn&amp;#39;t want to talk to me, or maybe he never really cared enough to be my friend in the first place and it was just me forcing things and looking for signs that weren&amp;#39;t there.  That&amp;#39;s how things stand with Matt right now, but... there&amp;#39;s another guy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks after I asked out Matt I was feeling down on myself and browsing around on Grindr.  I don&amp;#39;t know what I was really looking for (definitely not sex) but I really wanted to just be close to someone for once in my life.  I ended up talking to a guy we&amp;#39;ll call Chris.  He seemed nice enough, we talked for a bit, and I thought I would give it a shot so I asked him to dinner.  It went alright, we kissed at the end of the date, and, although I wasn&amp;#39;t really looking for it, he wanted to have sex with me and I eventually gave in and got him off.  Side note: I have never been able to get off with another person despite the 3 people I have tried with.  Anyways, since that night we&amp;#39;ve hung out twice more and I&amp;#39;ve gotten him off again one of those nights.  My friends are excited for me but I don&amp;#39;t know if I feel the same way.  When I hang out with him I feel really awkward and anxious.  I&amp;#39;m constantly worrying about what to say to him or how I can get him to laugh but it ends up with me just stuck in my head, unable to say anything at all.  I can&amp;#39;t get past the formal stage of just asking him basic questions like what kind of music he likes, what food he likes, etc.  I confided in a friend about this and she just told me I&amp;#39;m not awkward and that I&amp;#39;m overthinking it too much.  Admittedly, I probably am but shouldn&amp;#39;t conversation flow naturally?  Shouldn&amp;#39;t I not have to try to force things?  This brings us to the subject of this post and thank you if you&amp;#39;ve read this far.  I thought I was done with my feelings with Matt and I thought I could move on but I think I tried to get involved with someone else too soon.  Last night I was feeling especially sad and crying; I couldn&amp;#39;t stop thinking about Matt even though I hadn&amp;#39;t in a while.  We had class together yesterday and I guess being around him just set me off.  I know that these feelings I have for him can never go anywhere, it&amp;#39;s my responsibility to kill that part of myself, but that doesn&amp;#39;t change the fact that I still have them. So I&amp;#39;m meeting with Chris later today and I am going to tell him that I don&amp;#39;t think we should see each other.  It isn&amp;#39;t fair of me to lead him on when I&amp;#39;m still thinking about another guy and frankly I feel like an asshole for it.
