But then today came. My doctor's head always trembles a bit, I've never asked about it, but today the shake was really noticeable. She went down the list of vitals from my work. I don't know if she was stalling or my adrenaline was pumping that much, but each word seemed drawn-out and slow.

Finally she said it. Her eyes bounced a bit as they locked with mine, my mother (who'd refused to stay in the waiting room) started to wail behind me. I felt like ice, a stupid grin ripped across my face and I sighed big. ""I bet you're feeling pretty numb,"" the doctor said, ""it hit me like a 2x4 when I found out.""

In retrospect, yeh I guess I was pretty numb. But at the time I said I just felt stupid, ashamed. I'd messed up so bad. The doctor proffered a couple things about next steps and the long, fulfilling life to be had, but it all just flowed past me.

I'm supposed to get a call, and then things'll start. It's been about seven hours since finding out and the news keeps tolling in me like a church bell. My friends have been fantastic, I feel loved and know I'll be ok. But I'm scared, I'm really scared.

I have no issue with feminine mannerisms, they just aren't  attractive to me.  I want a guy who is diverse.

Edit: hopefully made my question clearer. I don't mean to step on toes. nor is this post to say a guy isn't a man if he is feminine.. That is not true at all.

So I'm using an obvious throwaway for various reasons.

I am a 22 year old bottom and that 6 months I have noticed that I have developed a rather large external hemorrhoid. (size of a large blueberry/ or medium grape when engorged) I do not know what to do to treat this though :( I am currently, as of the beginning of this week, beginning a higher fiber diet and drinking much more water than I usually do. I am trying not to strain when I poop, but I know it's there when I wipe... -_- It's affecting me rather badly as I have not done anything sexually because of it. I can still 'push it back' to it's original position, but I am worried it will become permanently distended.

Any advice on this? Or is it time I seek out a gastroenterologist and have it surgically removed...?

Edit: If you do have any solutions please keep in mind that if they are dietary I cannot consume diary, beautiful perk of being lactose intolerant.
