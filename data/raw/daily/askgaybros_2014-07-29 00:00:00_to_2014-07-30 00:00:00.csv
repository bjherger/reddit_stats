Thank you for all your phenomenal advice when I posted last week.  [Here is the thread for anyone who isn't familiar.](http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/2beppg/straight_guy_here_my_friend_admitted_he_was_gay/) Long story short of that last post is that I have a friend who's ""come out"" several times now, but he only admits he's gay when he's drunk.  The next day, he continues to act like he's still straight, and I wanted to know if there was anything I could say/do to help the process.  I was asked by a couple of people to post an update, so I figured I'd give a quick rundown of what happened next.

He's been ""seeing"" this girl for a couple of days, and he kept going on about how he was going to invite her out with us on Friday night.  Friday came and we are pregaming at my other friend's house, and someone asks where she is (he's been talking about inviting her for like a week now).  He gets kind of awkward about it and says he's ""not that into her anymore"" and no one talks about it after that.  

Fast forward to later that night, lots of drinks later.  He and I are walking to get drunken cheesesteaks at 2am, and I asked him about why he's just suddenly not into this girl.  He pauses and then is like ""...you know why.""  Again, I remind him that it's ok to be himself.  There's nothing to be ashamed of and we are all cool with it.  At first he didn't respond, but then out of nowhere, he starts **crying** and I didn't know what to do, so I just hugged him.  (This is all in the middle of the sidewalk, by the way.)  I take him back to his place, and on the way there, he's just sobbing, going on about how he ""doesn't want to be a minority"" and how ""he used to be perfect, he didn't have any real problems"" and how ""he hates that he was born a freak."" I didn't know what to really do at this point, so I kept reiterating that he's not weird - he's completely normal.  Then he went on and on about how it wasn't fair that he was born with this, and I basically told him to suck it up and that lots of people are born with shit they don't want.  I also pretty much told him that he's being a baby about this, and that lots of people would happily trade to be in his ""shitty"" spot right now.  He finally agreed after some coaxing, and I also gave him half of my cheesesteak too to get him to chill.

Anyway, I thought this was the biggest breakthrough yet (!!).  We got back and he, his roommate, and I watched Rick &amp; Morty.  I passed out on his couch and hung out with them and our other friends the next day.  We didn't bring up the night before at all, and it was a huge elephant in the room.  However, we basically day drank all day, and at one point, he starts talking about Tinder, and he's bragging about some of the matches he was getting.  He then proceeds to show us like three or four really hot girls and is saying his typical douchey shit, like ""Damn what should I say to this girl?"" and ""Do you think I could bang her tonight?""  

It was pissing me off, because I thought we made decent progress last night.  Also, I thought it was incredibly childish, because he knows I struggle with chicks sometimes, and I feel like he was just rubbing it in my face.  But I bit my tongue, because we were with his roommate, and I didn't know if he was ""out"" (ha) to his roommate yet.  If you're counting, this is the **fourth** time he decided to take a ride on the revolving closet door.

Later that night, he keeps showing us these flirty Tinder messages from this girl, and I just basically lost it.  I said, ""Look whether or not you want to own up to being who you are is your problem.  But I don't want to hear about these girls anymore.  Stop trying to convince me you're straight, because you're not.""  Then he basically said ""fuck you"" to me and didn't really talk to me for the rest of the night.

I haven't really talked to him since then.  Granted, we have a group chat, so I might have not have talked to him directly anyway.  I probably won't see him again until Thursday or so.

Was I too harsh?  Should I have phrased stuff differently?  Am I being too insensitive?  I keep imagining the sobbing mess of a kid on the sidewalk.  I'm just confused, because he was acting like he was this huge failure of a person and that his life was going to be so hard, but in reality, he probably has it easiest out of all of our friends.  It's frustrating.  But I'm done with the girls.  I'm not going to listen to incessant humblebragging about these chicks when I know he's not into any of them.  Maybe that makes me a bad friend, but I've had enough.

**tl;dr** - Got friend to come out for the **fourth** time (and the most emotional come out yet) and then went back to square one.  I may or may not have been a dick, and now he's mad at me.  Please don't judge too much - it's exhausting.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone.

Became friends and hung out for two months, then he left to go back home which is only ~9 hours away, two states over. I am not out to my parents, nor am I going to be any time soon for reasons I'm sure you can all guess.

I've been wanting to visit him for a few days over the summer. Though I'm almost 21, I still live at home, because college is very close and it seemed like an obvious choice. My boyfriend is 28, and actually finished college a while ago. We met online but have spent plenty of time together in person. Neither of these things would help my case, so I've lied and made him a few years younger, and said we met through school instead of online. I'd also like to note that he is very sympathetic to my situation because he has dealt with a similar parent. He says his two sisters still haven't managed to escape his mom and live right next door to her. I belong to one of those cultures where parents just do not let go of their kids. Not until they're pushing 30 or 40. He isn't forcing me to visit him, but I can tell that if we can't see each other every once in a while, it's not going to work out. It'd be at least another year before I finished school and could move. 

In comes the helicopter parent to end all helicopter parents. My mom has been at my back from the second I was conceived and she shows no signs of letting up. I brought this up as wanting to visit a friend who went away for college. I said he was my age, we met here, he went away for college, I want to visit. At first she didn't even react. She just said okay. I bought a ticket that's only a few days away. Suddenly she is showing her full brunt of crazy. Apparently she never reacted because she didn't believe me. I gave her his address, name, and phone number. As much as I dislike my mom's nervous disposition, I know it's a good idea to have someone know where I am and who I'm with... then she asked for: a photo, his parent's names, his parent's numbers, his parent's address, wanted to meet his parents, wanted to Skype with him. I put my foot down and said no. Enough is enough. I've been treated like a complete child by an overly paranoid mom for too long and frankly I'm embarrassed of it, but there is only so much I can do before I move out. I've warned her that if she keeps this up I will want as little contact as possible when I leave. It doesn't stop her. What am I to do? Revealing he's my boyfriend will definitely put a stop on the trip. Not going after I've made several promises I would go, and having told him I've bought a ticket is also not an option I can live with, and as easy as it would be to just leave and call her once I'm there, I don't think I could do that to her, either.  Am I in the wrong or is she completely overreacting? And really, feel free to tell me I'm in the wrong. I'm not exactly a neutral party. I may the one who is acting insane. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;A little backstory: we met seven months ago when he was visiting here. Became friends and hung out for two months, then he left to go back home which is only ~9 hours away, two states over. I am not out to my parents, nor am I going to be any time soon for reasons I&amp;#39;m sure you can all guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been wanting to visit him for a few days over the summer. Though I&amp;#39;m almost 21, I still live at home, because college is very close and it seemed like an obvious choice. My boyfriend is 28, and actually finished college a while ago. We met online but have spent plenty of time together in person. Neither of these things would help my case, so I&amp;#39;ve lied and made him a few years younger, and said we met through school instead of online.
