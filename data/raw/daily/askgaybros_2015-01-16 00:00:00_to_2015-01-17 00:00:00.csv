I'm months lurking around this subreddit, and I wanna share my story. It's not a question or anything, just a place for me to tell you guys how happy I am.

This subreddit has taught me wide variety of fetishes, preference, tastes, etc. I was hoping I can get some guy via hookup and just wish one day when I wake up he'll magically fall in love with me. But maybe it just doesn't work for me. Craigslist was my bestfriend.

I stopped casual sex for around two months, and just gave all my hopes up and looking for a guy that would make me happy. And just the day before Christmas, I just thought of randomly opening my e-mail where I arrange hookups. Business as usual, dick pics, ass pics, nah I'm just tired of screwing around. And I found this unusual reply which sounded kinda not into sex. It reads: ""Hi my name is 'Paul', 21, 5'4"", cute, handsome, charming, here's my number please text me."" I did, and I got a reply. We started talking and I learned he's away from the town for family visit for the holidays and he'll be back in town after christmas. We talked for at least 4 hours daily, nothing sexual, just trying to know each other.

When he got back from his hometown, we agreed to meetup and hang out. We did, it's great, and we're enjoying each other's company. We confessed we felt the intimacy between us each time we saw each other. We went out couple of dates for almost a month. And I might just ask this guy to be my boyfriend soon, as he told me he would love it too. But we're not into labels yet since we want to savor things without being pressured by labels. For now, we enjoy what we're having but I'll just let you know if I'm successful to be this guy's other half soon.

I know we're not yet there, and I know I don't know whether this guy's the ""guy"" or not, but he makes me happy in a new level and that's what matters. We want to know where this mutual feeling is taking us, and we're enjoying it.

More about this guy, umm yeah he's short lol, playful, funny, smells great like even his armpits shout heavens, well-groomed, tidy, down to earth, always drives me home if I'm passed out thanks to my buddies, smart, fucking good singing voice, makes me laugh all the time, decent, gorgeous, most of all accepts all of my imperfection (from my hideous face, down to my moody attitude, narcissistic tendencies, not to mention being just a total fucker, not that it's bad, but for a pretty conservative place where I'm from where hookups are really frowned upon, this guy never frowned on my past) He makes me smile every time, and I can't wait what future has for us.

Thank you so much for being outspoken, open, and really cool. You guys rock. Even though this post sounds idealistic, there are bros right here making me realize that idealism isn't impossible. Nonetheless, as a newly out guy after years of being confused, ik soliciting random advice from strangers online may be a horrible idea, but I think I took risk and I'm happy for doing so. Everything's falling into pieces, my parents had a hard time accepting who I am and told me I should ""try"" to be straight. You might have seen me around but thanks for sharing sympathy with me. And now, from accepting myself, I'm moving on to accepting others into my life in a romantic field.

Please do wish me for the best.

Thanks! I love you bros!

PS. Sex is off the table for us since we met. Guy's a virgin. Willing to wait. I'm falling in love with this dude so I should wait.

Every other aspect of our relationship is great. We have great sex, we travel together, have the same sense of humor and just genuinely enjoy being around one another. We love each other.

So with our differing perspectives on this one issue, how do we find something we can both move forward with? We almost broke up because his desire to go after that ""new thrill/new spark"" feeling was so strong.

We met and dated through school but I have just graduated. We were each others first serious relationship, and my first relationship in general. We were living together for a year and it was ok I was rather hesitant to do it in the first place because I didn't want something to happen between us and then be forced to live together for the remainder of the lease. I have always been more reserved in the relationship while he has been fully committed for the time we have been dating and has made it clear that he thinks I'm the only one for him, I however do not really feel the same way. 

Lately I have been feeling like the spark has gone out of our relationship but still care about him but don't think I want to continue dating him for reasons I'll go through below.
 
I also had the possibility of moving out of state for a job and we had discussed this several times and decided that it would be best to see other people as we didn't think a long distance relationship would work as he had had bad experiences in the past. From these discussions we decided that it would be best to end it and try again when I moved back to my home state as I wanted to do. Well I was offered a job out of state and took it because it was all most my dream job, but I will most likely not be moving back to the state any time soon. He was not able to move out with me do to other reasons. even if he were to move out here there are no jobs for what he wants to do, and I know that if I was to support him entirely I would to resent him for it and I don't think he would be happy here either while away from family and friends. 

Our sex life has also been lack luster for a while. When we first started dating we were definitely more active but as we went on it got to be less and less frequent to the point of once every month or so. We both talked about how we needed to try more but nothing changed and if anything got worse. I'm not saying that I define a good relationship is defined by constant sex but I would like it to be a little bit more of the relationship. And when we did do something I would usually end up fantasizing about other people to finish when ever we were not having penetrative sex as was usually the case as our relationship progressed.

As I said earlier I haven't felt the desire to be in a romantic relationship with him fora while now and have almost broken up with him a couple of times over the last year or so. Didn't because I was afraid that I would not be able to find anybody else who I got a long with and was attracted to me ( I dint have the best self-confidence). So I stayed with him hoping that I would realize my error and that I was afraid to be on my own after years with someone there. 

After moving to my new job and having some time apart I have gotten over my fear of being alone, but I would still like to be friends with him but want to explore my options and part of me wants to live this new part of my life as a new beginning as there are parts of my past that have been limiting until now.

I feel selfish for wanting to move on for my own reasons and that im throwing all of hearing things he's done for me in his face. I have talked this out with him and we have decided on a break for the moment. I have also talked this out with some close friends and one thing that they have said is that if I am already considering ending it then I probably should as I am not really committed to the relationship anymore.

I'm sorry if this is a little disjointed and all over the place but any advice would be welcome.

I have no idea how this works when you're facing 40 and fresh out of a relationship, desperately looking to move to a new town where one might end up with no friends or connections. 

It seems insane, but that's how badly I want to leave where I live (horribly boring insanely suffocating town in Midwestern US that I relo'ed to for a job many years ago) I've been meditating this decision for about two years now, and I determined South Florida is likely the best place for me to go. I have one advantage which is that I have my own business and can run it anywhere I want to. 

But I'm also not rich, which does limit me to a reasonable rent bracket of around 1300-1700 per month. 

One thing is that while I am young in appearance still and young at heart, I'm not a partier and I hate nightlife noise. Therefore something like Miami Beach seems a little intense for me. At the same time, I would like a walkable area close to the beach. And because i'm looking to meet new people, a community that is very dense LGBT would be preferable.

You bunch have always provided me with the best advice when it came to my very immature interpretations of love etc, so now that I've (hopefully) matured a little, I'm hoping I could call on your advice again.

Long story shortened; met a guy last September, very bad first date (me a quite sheep, him arrogant and self centred), we ""dated"" (nothing happened) for a month and had a falling out. Reconciled around Christmas, we talked it out and decided to give it a go again. So we went out after new years, drinks were good, went to a club and we patched it up.

So we talked and talked, and he mentioned some interesting points. We both admitted that we're into each other (physically and intellectually - we're both research nerds). He first said he didn't want to date me (quote ""it's not that I don't want to date you, I do, it's just that...I'm afraid I'd let you down"") due to work commitments but we remedied that with agreeing to trying to make time for each other and take it slowly and casually, a ""see how it goes"" approach as we're a little weary of one another since last time. All good I think. 

Next interesting thing he said was ""You bring out the worst in me...we bring out the worst in each other...because I work from first impressions and we were both not ourselves so that's left an impact"". So once again, we talked it out, and I suggested we try and find what that something is, what the ""worst"" is, as he says he's not like himself around me vs. his best friends, and that somewhat holds true for me too.

However I feel he has a point. I work from first impressions also, so I do have a little bad taste in my mouth about him. We both have complimentary interests/similarities, and I wouldn't forgive myself if I left it as friends right now (as he said ""I'd feel bad about hurting you but no pain no gain I suppose"") so we're both on the same page; we really want to make this work if possible, but there are some social thorns; miscommunication, lack of understanding, defensiveness, pointless argument making/defending (if it makes a difference, I call it cultural issues as he's Eastern European [50/50 time on where he's lived from birth to now - there and here], I'm Irish and I reckon that somewhat contributes to it).

So my question is as the title says; how do we clean the slate? After knowing and hanging with someone for 4/5 months on and off, how do we go about solving these ""issues"" and pretending to go on date number 1 all over again? It does seem we both copped on since September, and we want to give this a shot, but obviously it won't work if we don't clear the peculiar bad blood. But that's the first issue, finding a way to work out the ""stalling"" or awkwardness between us.

I'm almost 18 and I've already had a crush on two straight guys I knew; one time it was BAD and one time it was just bad.
Now the thing is I feel ultra-lonely most of the time and I just can't do anything about it.
I once registered on a dating site and tried talking to guys there, but I always ended up aborting all contact as soon as things started getting a little bit more serious. Now I forgave myself doing this and thought I'm just a little shy.
But then, last year, my grandpa died and I expected myself to feel sad about it. But I realized I weren't doing so.
In fact I was shocked because I just didn't feel anything: I weren't happy nor sad. Wondering why, I realized that I just never formed a real (generic) relationship at all. My parents are divorced and when I'm not at one's home I *never* felt the need to call the other one. My brother annoys me at best, and my friends only care about themselves (like I seem to do).

I was always looking for a way to find a boyfriend, but lately started wondering if I can form any relationship at all?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi there, I hope my questions doesn&amp;#39;t end sounding silly (and no I&amp;#39;m sadly no troll)?&lt;/p&gt;
