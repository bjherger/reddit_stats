I also have a brother and sister in college. Everything in my life has been fairly good and non-eventful until recently. 

So back in March I came out to my parents. [Their reaction wasn’t horrible but it still went poorly with my mom](http://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/21ajrt/came_out_to_mothernow_im_reeling_and_discouraged/). Well now I have been dating a guy for only 2 weeks (yes, only 14 days and no where near official) and my mom found out. Now I wanted to tell her and my dad… but it was nothing to write home about yet at all.  When my mom mentioned it everything went down hill.

She wasn’t happy…at all. Despite her saying she’s “cool” with me being bi, I feel those statements are just a shallow facet. Not only did she not ask anything about him nor say anything positive, she delved into a whole conversation about how I shouldn’t tell other people and keep it quiet. I told her that it is my choice and, and quite frankly, it only becomes an issue when other people view it as such. None of my friends or other family have cared, yet ironically she took my coming out as a big ordeal and thus made it such. Everything she said was selfish (“what will people say to me…I feel so blind-sided”) and she never asked how I felt or how she would at least try to make things better. 

Quite frankly I wasn’t expecting out-pouring love and happiness, but this talk made me feel depressed and like the one at fault for coming out. I was apologizing for things like making my coming-out a complete surprise to her (everyone else had no clue too) or not telling her sooner.  She keeps on saying she didn’t know where she went wrong as a bad parent and feels like we don’t communicate (I told her I love and trust her, but coming out was the most stressful/terrifying thing I’ve done which would explain why I hid it from her and my dad). 

My dilemma now is how to handle it. She said the *same* things 3 months ago when I came out and there were no improvements. I want to tell her she is making a mountain from a molehill, not putting an effort to get a different mindset, or realizing how much she is hurting me in this whole process.  I am stuck between a rock and a hard place; If I tell her what she’s could do to handle this better she would get upset and reinforce her idea that she’s a bad parent…and if I don’t do anything this will continue and it’s way too much hurt and stress. I already told her that over time things will get better, to not fret over something so intangible, and let her know that I care and trust her. None of it seemed to get through…

I want to make things right, especially with grad school looming. I am planning to live at home and commute, but if she cannot show that she cares about me and will make some effort to move forward I don’t want to live at home. I could easily move into an on-campus apartment, but my parents would know *exactly* why I moved out and be devastated.

If you guys have any advice I’d appreciate it, I’m in a really dark place right now. My mom saying that she’s still “100% blind-sided” by this 3 months later and not showing any signs of unconditional love is depressing. My siblings are furious with her homophobia and want her to go to therapy now.

That hurts me a lot and the worst part is that he text this other guy daily, he text him ""good morning honey"" exactly when he text me the same, he ask this guy about a hair cut as he does with me at the same time, he ask him to grab a diner and eat ice cream so this isn't just sex, my boyfriend likes the guy.

The other part that bothers me is that with me he is so cuddly and sweet and this guy treats him like shit and he likes that, he call him bitch and whore and my boyfriend still go after him.

I see also another chat with a friend where he said joking that he was double-married refereeing to me and this guy and that he was trying to stay single.

From this I get that: My boyfriend is not looking for relationships so he basically want to have fun with us and he is playing with us basically making us believe that I or the other one is the only guy in his life right now while he sleeps with both.

My doubts are

- First of all why is he dating this guy and why is he dating me. If he feel turned on by this guy (i think thats the reason why he date him) way staying with me?

- He have fun with both of us but when his family went to another country for holidays he ask me to stay with him, not this guy so theres something different about how he treat us. Why?

- Sexually we have a really good sex life and he cums every time even without touching himself so why does he need another one for sex?

- Emotionally this guy doesn't cover his need obviously and I think that is one of the reasons he date me. But to be sincere, I'm the top and I'm a good power top, I'm big, I'm smart, I'm on the last year of engineering, I'm good looking, I consider myself a catch and this other guy works in a supermarket and his higher degree is college, he is not studding and has no future so I feel so betrayed and mad because I'm been replaced with a guy that has nothing to offer!!!
