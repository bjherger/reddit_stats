This is probably going to be pretty long so sorry in advance.


About a year and a half ago, I moved to NYC for professional grad school. When I moved here, my boyfriend of a year and half broke up (he moved here for grad school too) due to him realizing he thinks he wants to get married to a woman (he's bisexual). It was frustrating because things seemed really good and I was very happy. I spent some time focusing on my new life here and dealing with my feelings, and for about a year or so have been in a place where I'm mostly over it and open to meeting someone else.


Dating here in NYC has basically been nothing short of a trainwreck. Most of my friends are straight (I do have a few gay friends) and our grad program can be very insular so I don't really meet new gays guy easily for friends or dating on a regular basis. I've used OKC and Tinder, but I've also joined a gay sports league and am thinking about joining and gay group around one of my hobbies to make some more gay friends and meet more people outside of my program.


I'm getting really jaded and sick of having different variations of the same crappy experience whenever I go on dates with a guy I like. Basically - what happens is I go on a few great dates with a guy who I find attractive and feel I connect with. Often times, this is a guy who first hit on me and asked me out (either from online or a few times i guy I met in person at a friends party or a bar) and for the first couple dates will be very clearly into it - asking me out again, texting me, or saying they like me. Then, they start to be flakey and either keep canceling plans they make with me and/or won't ever initiate plans but will hang out if I do. I am sure I am not being clingy - I make it clear I'm interested, but I do not text someone everyday or text them if they ignore a previous text. 


In the past, I had tried confronting guys about it in a non-dramatic fashion after the behavior persisted for awhile by saying something along the lines of ""i have fun spending time together and interested in continuing to hang out and see where things go, but I'm getting the feeling you aren't as into it - if that's the case, that's totally cool I'd just like to know that"". The response has 95% of the time been some variation of ""no- i like you i've just been busy or *insert excuse here* and i definitely want to keep seeing each other."" Then, after this conversation, if I don't text them or initiate hanging out, I'll never hear from them again or they'll make plans only to keep cancelling them and text me very infrequently. 


I do not understand this behavior - it's incredibly frustrating that even when I give them an easy out to end it so I can have some clarity, guys will not take it. In the past, after this happened, I've asked one or two guys if there was anything specific I did that caused this to happen and said to be blunt because if there was, I'd like to work on it. Both said no and espoused how ""I'm such a catch"" and how they like me but *insert excuse here*. I'm not delusional - I know the excuses I'm getting are bullshit - I'm in an extremely rigorous grad program and do a lot of ECs/volunteering so I'm very busy, but if you really like somebody, you can find the time. I now realize that asking these things or trying to give guys an out to end it is a waste of my time - and that flaky behavior in itself is enough for me to decide to be done with the situation. 


It is pretty depressing and annoying because I am now at the point where I don't feel I can tell the difference between an amazing first couple dates with a guy who genuinely likes me vs a guy who is going to do something like this. If I go on a date(s) with a guy who isn't a jerk and decide I'm not that into it, I always am honest and tell them that I don't think there is enough chemistry for me to keep seeing each other. Almost always, people really appreciate this and respond well.


While I do love being in love and happy in a relationship, I don't feel I have to have a bf, don't feel constantly lonely, and am certainly not going to settle for someone I'm not crazy about. Dating has been so frustrating part of me thinks I should just stop for awhile, but part of the problem is I'm incredibly horny all the time more than I ever have been in my life and I'm not really into casual sex. If I don't have sex for more than 2 months or so, I start to become kind of crazy and I feel it negatively affects other aspects of my life I've been trying to become more ok with casual sex, but it's hard for me to not feel super trashy and weird about it afterwards even though I don't judge friends for similar behavior. Furthermore, if I'm not at least somewhat emotionally attracted to/feel like I click with a guy, I end up losing interest sexually which makes a friends with benefit situation something probably hard for me to find. Basically - I'm either interested in dating a guy and like him and want to have sex or realize I'm not and can't maintain interest sexually. Since I'd definitely be open to seriously dating someone and I'm horny and casual sex is ultimately not something I love, continuing to date seems to be the most logical option.


I definitely spend time focusing on myself - I lift weights 5-6x days a week which I really like, spend time with my friends, and doing hobbies I enjoy (cooking, sports, playing piano, pool, strategy board games, etc.) But because everyone is so goddamn flaky and unreliable, in order to date and semi-regularly get laid, I have to spend a non insignificant amount of time talking with guys and setting up dates. Even though I know I'm not, I am starting to feel crazy and clingy for wanting to hang out at least once or twice a week after having a couple really good dates with someone. I feel like I can't even figure out how much I like someone or where things will go hanging out less frequently than that, but I feel like I'm the only single gay guy in this city who wants to make a real connection. 


Do any of you bros feel this way - if so, how do you stay positive? Any advice on anything I should do differently? While I'm fine being single now, I know eventually I'd like to date someone seriously and settle down/get married, and it feels like that's so fucking unlikely to ever happen considering how I haven't even gotten anywhere near dating a guy i like regularly for more than a month in a year and a half since moving here.


;tldr - venting about dating in NYC sucks, early 20s and guys i like always act interested at first and then become flaky and always give excuses but never own up to the fact they're not into it. Frustrated and feel like I'm the only guy here who is honest and wants something real - want advice on how to deal with it and stay positive

&lt;p&gt;I definitely spend time focusing on myself - I lift weights 5-6x days a week which I really like, spend time with my friends, and doing hobbies I enjoy (cooking, sports, playing piano, pool, strategy board games, etc.) But because everyone is so goddamn flaky and unreliable, in order to date and semi-regularly get laid, I have to spend a non insignificant amount of time talking with guys and setting up dates. Even though I know I&amp;#39;m not, I am starting to feel crazy and clingy for wanting to hang out at least once or twice a week after having a couple really good dates with someone. I feel like I can&amp;#39;t even figure out how much I like someone or where things will go hanging out less frequently than that, but I feel like I&amp;#39;m the only single gay guy in this city who wants to make a real connection. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do any of you bros feel this way - if so, how do you stay positive? Any advice on anything I should do differently? While I&amp;#39;m fine being single now, I know eventually I&amp;#39;d like to date someone seriously and settle down/get married, and it feels like that&amp;#39;s so fucking unlikely to ever happen considering how I haven&amp;#39;t even gotten anywhere near dating a guy i like regularly for more than a month in a year and a half since moving here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;;tldr - venting about dating in NYC sucks, early 20s and guys i like always act interested at first and then become flaky and always give excuses but never own up to the fact they&amp;#39;re not into it. Frustrated and feel like I&amp;#39;m the only guy here who is honest and wants something real - want advice on how to deal with it and stay positive&lt;/p&gt;

He would say things like you give me a reason to live, you make me so happy I don't know what I would do without you. I would die inside everytime he said it but I'd put on a happy face because I knew that I loved him really but I knew it wasn't lasting, and one day it would end.

So I broke up with him, the break up was perfectly fine he understood and accepted that. A week down the line my family has a party, cute bartender there whos showing interest in me, hes around my age, 27, and I really do like him, hes attractive funny he goes out a lot really confident in himself as a person makes his own way in life. So we've gone out for a drink just a quick one just to meet up, had a coffee the day after, went for a walk the day after that. 

So I go over his house just to spend some ""quality time"" you could say, and this is where I instantly realized that I might not be ready for this and I start getting nervous. One thing I should of mentioned is that my ex boyfriend wasn't the most attractive guys in the world, but I'm not the type to look at someone and judge them by the cover. But the reason I bring that up is, when I was with him I felt extremely attractive and very sexy because I was the young hottie that the old guy was banging. Thats very shallow of me but its how I feel I don't know why I just like the idea of it.

But with this guy, hes verrrrry attractive beautiful body beautiful face and I get very self conscious when I'm around him and very nervous that hes judging me or thinks hes too good for me etc etc. It's really putting me off and when we were cuddling and he wanted to you know play around a bit I just couldn't get it up. I'm lying down with this gorgeous guy and I'm so nervous and I'm not the type to be nervous in the bedroom. 

I don't know what to do or how to resolve this I'm kind of just writing this to get it off my chest and see if anyone's been through similar. I really like this guy but I don't know whats wrong with me.

Oh and me and my ex are still texting every 2-3 days just to catch up, I know thats not a good idea but I can't just cut all contact (I know thats probably the better idea, but I can't break his heart like that)

Thanks in advance for any replies, I'm really after people's genuine advice - don't butter it up.
I met Nathan (name changed) about 3 months ago. I was very cautious at first not to sugar coat the relationship, in fact I nearly told him every reason he shouldn't go out with me but we still fell for eachother very quickly.

Nathan has had many more partners than I have, despite being a year younger. He has had many short relationships, I myself have had 3 in my entire life (this being my third). My first relationship lasted 4 years. At first everything was perfect, Nathan would travel the hour and 10 minutes every weekend to come and see me. He would stay at my Mum's house where I still live (he lives at home with his Dad).

The first bit of trouble started when my Mum suddenly decided she rejected my gay lifestyle and about a month in asked that Nathan stop coming over. I was absolutely devestated. I rang Nathan and cried with him over the phone - he was so, so supportive and said he understood. I then didn't speak to Mum and she asked me what was wrong after a few days (we were previously very close). I told her how much I loved Nathan and that it killed me he couldn't come over anymore. After seeing how much it meant to me my mother changed her mind and said that Nathan is welcome to stay over - but even though he has stayed over a few times already since then, he doesn't feel comfortable around my family and feels unwanted. It was my mothers birthday a few weekends ago and although he was invited to come to her lunch at a restaurant, he declined. After what has happened, I don't blame him. I feel sorry for him. He has said he is willing to forgive but he can't forget and it does hurt me a bit that my partner who I really do love isn't really a part of my family WHEN

Every weekend that we have met with the exception of one I have stayed at his mothers house. His mother and him had a rough history but she has recently come into his life. His mother lives about 20 minutes from my place and she is incredibly welcoming. A typical weekend (and it has been extremely repetitive) involves Nathan picking me up from my house on Friday afternoon, us travelling together to his mom's house. We have dinner and chat to his step brother's and his step father. His family have made me feel very, very welcomed.

The problems: I never really get to see Nathan on his own except at night when we go to bed. We've never been to see a movie together, never been out to a restaurant, never really done anything except go to his mothers house. We go shopping all the time, but he walks next to his Mum and I walk behind them. In the car the conversation is always with him and his Mum with me just interjecting with my opinion when there is a gap in the conversation. At this point I should also let you know that Nathan is Italian and I have read that Italian boys and their Mums are pretty much inseparable and have a much closer relationship than in normal Western culture.

Nathan always talks about his many ex partners (in normal conversation) and this makes me feel awkward. It doesn't seem to bother him though and I just try and put on a fake laugh and smile.

I love Nathan, I've told him this from very early on. He has told me he loves me back, he tells me I mean more to him than anything in the world and talks about us getting married, buying a house, travelling overseas. He works full-time during the week (I am on a disability support pension).

I at times don't feel like I deserve Nathan as a partner. I told him this last night before bed and he said not to be silly. He tells me how hot I am and tries to build me up. I suffer from depression and I have another health condition which I take medication for - the side effects make me so tired that I can't often keep up with him and his Mum. They go to the shops probably 3 or 4 times in a weekend and at the end of the day (because we stay at his mom's) I end up crashing on the couch and feel really bad and anti-social that I am lying on the couch asleep or watching television when he is outside with his family. I just don't have the energy to keep up.

What do I want? I'd love a weekend where it was just the two of us. One Friday night I booked a night at a 5 star hotel and surprised him with it, but he said that he didn't want to drive that far (because he'd already driven) and we stayed the night on the couch at his Mum's instead.
There's one more big thing. Nathan has a childhood friend (a girl) who he is literally best friends with. He only has one friend really, this girl. She has boyfriends. Nathan told me in a joking way that this girl grabs his dick whilst his trying to drive, I've seen photos of her naked on his phone, he says she walks around the house naked. I read the messages he and her sent eachother and he said ""I can't wait to see you my beautiful girl"" and she said ""I can't wait to see your cock"" and he said ""I am gonna pound you senseless"" in amidst other jokes. I confronted him about this. He told me that they have been friends since primary school, that he is completely 100% gay and that it is all joking around, that there isn't even a hint of truth in the messages - they just talk dirty as a joke to eachother. I told him I trusted him and he sent her a message saying not to talk dirty anymore.

So now the weekend is over. He goes back to his father's house and back to work. I'm stuck up here... waiting for next weekend where we will invariably spend the weekend at his Mom's house and go shopping. I'll barely be able to keep up and feel exhausted.

I am trying to be as objective as I can. I suffer from depression - I know I am probably making this so much harder than it has to be. Making huge issues out of nothing. I get so jealous - I mean this guy has one other friend, who am I to tell him not to have a friend! My Mum has been a bitch to him by asking him not to come over to the house, no wonder he feels uncomfortable.

I want to continue in this relationship. I dearly love Nathan, I feel he is my soulmate. There are just these few issues that dig away at me. If I lived closer to him and got to see him more than just on weekends it would enable us to really know eachother so much better. He rings me everynight and we talk for an hour before bed. He messages me during the day.

What is my problem? Is it me or him?

&lt;p&gt;I at times don&amp;#39;t feel like I deserve Nathan as a partner. I told him this last night before bed and he said not to be silly. He tells me how hot I am and tries to build me up. I suffer from depression and I have another health condition which I take medication for - the side effects make me so tired that I can&amp;#39;t often keep up with him and his Mum. They go to the shops probably 3 or 4 times in a weekend and at the end of the day (because we stay at his mom&amp;#39;s) I end up crashing on the couch and feel really bad and anti-social that I am lying on the couch asleep or watching television when he is outside with his family. I just don&amp;#39;t have the energy to keep up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do I want? I&amp;#39;d love a weekend where it was just the two of us. One Friday night I booked a night at a 5 star hotel and surprised him with it, but he said that he didn&amp;#39;t want to drive that far (because he&amp;#39;d already driven) and we stayed the night on the couch at his Mum&amp;#39;s instead.
There&amp;#39;s one more big thing. Nathan has a childhood friend (a girl) who he is literally best friends with. He only has one friend really, this girl. She has boyfriends. Nathan told me in a joking way that this girl grabs his dick whilst his trying to drive, I&amp;#39;ve seen photos of her naked on his phone, he says she walks around the house naked. I read the messages he and her sent eachother and he said &amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t wait to see you my beautiful girl&amp;quot; and she said &amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t wait to see your cock&amp;quot; and he said &amp;quot;I am gonna pound you senseless&amp;quot; in amidst other jokes. I confronted him about this. He told me that they have been friends since primary school, that he is completely 100% gay and that it is all joking around, that there isn&amp;#39;t even a hint of truth in the messages - they just talk dirty as a joke to eachother. I told him I trusted him and he sent her a message saying not to talk dirty anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now the weekend is over. He goes back to his father&amp;#39;s house and back to work. I&amp;#39;m stuck up here... waiting for next weekend where we will invariably spend the weekend at his Mom&amp;#39;s house and go shopping. I&amp;#39;ll barely be able to keep up and feel exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am trying to be as objective as I can. I suffer from depression - I know I am probably making this so much harder than it has to be. Making huge issues out of nothing. I get so jealous - I mean this guy has one other friend, who am I to tell him not to have a friend! My Mum has been a bitch to him by asking him not to come over to the house, no wonder he feels uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to continue in this relationship. I dearly love Nathan, I feel he is my soulmate. There are just these few issues that dig away at me. If I lived closer to him and got to see him more than just on weekends it would enable us to really know eachother so much better. He rings me everynight and we talk for an hour before bed. He messages me during the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is my problem? Is it me or him?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks Reddit.&lt;/p&gt;

He sorta nervously confirmed they were dating so I gave him dap and told him that I was happy for him/them, and that was that. 

So we continued chilling out, maxing, relaxing all cool and a couple hours later Jake said ""so I guess somebody told you about me and John...""; so I told him the story of how I found out.

I want to apologize in advance for the poor writing here. I just woke up and am possibly still drunk from last night.

Ok so there's this guy that I've become really good friends with (i'll call him Bob). I hang out with him everyday and he's probably one of, if not best friends I've made at university. I've gotta admit, he's pretty fucking hot too. He acts kinda like a frat bro. Anyways, some things happened last night. We got really high/drunk last night for my other friend's birthday, and we got really touchy. It started innocent enough, just us sitting next to each other on the couch. He motioned for a high five, and when our hands collided we just interlocked our fingers and held hands for a while. Now, for me that was pretty hot. He's like super straight and everyone thinks I'm super straight too. So we're holding hands while I'm trying to keep from popping a boner, and then we let go. Then he lays his head down on my lap, I'm like freaking out on the inside. I put my hand on his head and start playing with his hair. I should just say I'm really a sensual guy so all this touching was just heaven for me. Throughout the night he would put his face really close to mine, like so close that a kiss would be really easy. I restrained myself from doing it though, gotta keep my straight image intact I thought; so i just kinda laughed and backed away. Somehow we were laying next to each other, and we started tickling each other. I would pat his stomach to make him jump, and he would cup my face in his hand. Oh my god just having his hand on me felt amazing. At another point in the night he came in the bathroom while I was taking a piss, claiming to have to pee. I put my dick away and told him to go for it, but I didn't leave. So I saw his dick again (yeah this isn't the first time I've seen his dick). I would have kept mine out but it was semi hard, and I didn't want him to see I was aroused, plus he's seen my dick before anyway. Later while we were laying down, he asked me for a massage, and I definitely wasn't gonna pass that opportunity up, so I massaged his  back, and I would go pretty low, like down to the very bottom of his back, where his ass begins. I got pretty excited and put my hands under his shirt to massage him. Then  after the massage I think I got a little too touchy. I think I just had my arm around him or something, but I kept putting my face kinds close to his. He was like""Come on dude don't make out with me."" I wasn't really planning on it, but hearing him say that I started backing off, I think he was starting to sober up at that point. He's the kind of guy who would probably make out with a guy if he was dared to. Actually, he told me he kissed a guy before during a spin the bottle game or something. Ok wow, this post became way longer than I expected it to be, let me just get to the point. I really like Bob as a friend, but I've read those stories of two seemingly straight bros who start messing around with each other, and I can't help but think that that can happen with me and Bob. We're having another party tonight and he's coming. Should I hold back, or should I continue trying to make something happen?  I'd love some advice and I'd love to hear similar stories if you bros have them.

TL;DR: I got really touchy with my straight friend last night while drunk, even to the point of almost crossing streams. He's coming over again tonight, should I try to make something happen or nah?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I already posted this in &lt;a href=""/r/TotallyStraight""&gt;/r/TotallyStraight&lt;/a&gt; but I think it&amp;#39;d go good here too&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to apologize in advance for the poor writing here. I just woke up and am possibly still drunk from last night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok so there&amp;#39;s this guy that I&amp;#39;ve become really good friends with (i&amp;#39;ll call him Bob). I hang out with him everyday and he&amp;#39;s probably one of, if not best friends I&amp;#39;ve made at university. I&amp;#39;ve gotta admit, he&amp;#39;s pretty fucking hot too. He acts kinda like a frat bro. Anyways, some things happened last night. We got really high/drunk last night for my other friend&amp;#39;s birthday, and we got really touchy.

Problem is that I don’t think it was sincere and I don’t want to push him off the cliff either. How do I deal with this ? BTW, he’s 21 and I am 19.


I'll try to make this quick...


I've been working with a guy for about six months and I am pretty sure (98%) that he's gay. From the first day, there has been stares, smiles, he always is after me to talk or insist that we eat together during the break, is careful about the way he looks, what he eats and I even surprised him testing me by touching my hand and waiting for my reaction, etc. There has been a lot of wooing, if I may say, from both sides. Everyone, including me, think he is gay and interested in me.


Now, the thing is we had our Christmas party lately and he invited me to sleep at his place since I had no way to go home after. Once at his appartement, I asked him if he was gay. He simply told me ""no"" but looked away while saying it. He wasn't very convincing. Plus, he never tried anything with a girl, never had a girlfriend, etc.


I don't want to rush him, because I remember when I was 16 how paranoiac I was about someone discovering it. But now I know how it feels to be free ! And it would make me sad to know he is in such a situation. 


If he is gay and lied to me, he made a bad move since I now am supposed to take for granted that he is straight, meaning HE would have to do the first steps if he wanted to go further. At the same time, most people at work are aware that I am, but no one makes a fuss about it, so I’m not even sure he knows for me.


If he is straight, then fine, it wouldn't be the first time I am disappointed if you know what I mean... And he is such a nice guy that I would be very happy if he finally found a girl who liked him


This is were you help me ! I'm sure one of you already had to cope with something similar. I wonder how I am supposed to make him understand that he doesn’t have to fear anything and that I can help him. Why does it have to always be so complicated ?...

I'm on a throwaway because a few friends know my username.

25M here, been with my bf for 3 and a half years now; he was pretty much my first in everything, and although I've often wandered what I may have been missing out on, being with him always felt more right than playing around.

Around September we started going through some stuff; he's having a real hard time graduating and he's several years behind - throw in his deeply introverted personality and some stuff he's working out with his therapist, things have not been well.


So around the same time this guy adds me on FB; I usually never friend people I dont know, but a guy from Uni was mutual and I thought we were in the same alma mater network.

Turns out the guy added me cuz he finds me hot; I thank him but I'm dismissive, b/c I'm in a relationship and he lives in another state.
He's relentless, texts me all day every day, compliments me... It had been a long time since I was last object of that kind of attentions.
He said he wasn't looking for a hook-up, but a boyfriend. 

Since I'm not one to go behind people's backs, I tell my bf this guy has been messaging me, and that I was flattered.
I also tell the guy that I wasn't going to throw 3 years out of the window for a guy who lives 2000 miles from me, but we can carry on chatting if he's cool with it.
He says he will try to put his feelings aside, and that we can still talk. Cool. We even make plans to see each other around xmas, as he'll be visiting family and be logistically closer.

A month ago, I realize I'm starting to be emotionally attached to him, he was part of my daily routine, even though he couldn't physically be here. 
He disappears for a whole weekend: turns out he started dating a guy, and I'm happy for him, though he could have just told me instead of pulling a disappearing act (we'd literally texted every day til that day).
He gets mad and accuses me of being jealous: since I'm not stubborn I tell him there may be some jealousy, but it was mainly concern.

From this point on, he starts to... tease me, I guess: he won't shut up about how he was lusting for this guy, get into detail about the things they would do together, etc. 
I've *never* spoken about my bf to him that way, first because I don't like to put my business in the streets, and second because knowing he had feelings for me, I didn't want to put him in an awkward position.

Internet guy then proceeds to use me as his emotional crutch with the guy he's dating, as he's afraid of having the talk, is convinced he's stepping out on him: he was being paranoid, and literally draining me of my time and energy.
Things were starting to get unbalanced.

Meanwhile things with my bf were looking bleak, and I could have used some help, but everytime I got into the topic he would give me this basic advice, 'well 3 years is a long time' type of shit.
It wasn't the first time I developed a crush while having a boyfriend, but this thing was starting to get to me: I began to feel inadequate.

So I decide to cut contact and work on stuff with my bf, as this guy wasn't good news.
Things with my bf are very rocky, as a matter of fact we had a huge fight last night (unrelated to internet guy).

So earlier today I drop the guy a message, and he texts back like nothing happened; he's very happy with this guy etc.
I tell him that the reason why I stop messaging was that I acknowledged my feelings for him, and that it was starting to be a problem for me and probably him too.
He says it was clear to him, but appreciates my honesty; I reply that I'll have to make peace with the fact that me and my bf aren't working out, and that me and him aren't gonna happen either.

Internet guy says that's still up for debate, as the guy he's seeing may turn out to be a dick etc. He then proceeds to tell me about their sex, drop innuendos, and so on.

So now I'm sitting here thinking what the fuck, he's been stringing me along the whole time.
How can you be so inconsiderate when I made sure to never say anything about my love life that could make him uncomfortable?

My guess, which is pretty much proven now, is that this guy loves the attention, feels empowered to have me doubting my relationship for him, and that nothing good will ever come out of this.

Sorry for the long rant, I *really* needed to get this off my chest; to those who will downvote/heckle me for getting into this mess while being with my bf, I didn't ask for this.
I'm not on the apps, never took any opportunity to hurt him, reject every proposition when I'm out clubbing... I have never cheated in my whole life, and this is just uncharted territory for me.
I'm lost, and I'd really love some insight and help here. Thanks to all of you who made it to here!

TL;DR: me and the bf are going through a pretty rough patch, a guy adds me on fb, we start talking, he likes me, I turn him down, then I realize I'm getting attached, he won't shut up about the guy he's seeing now. I cut communications.
Today after 20 days or radio silence I get back in touch and explain that I disappeared because I acknowledged the feelings I had for him.
He knew all along, and then proceeds to talk about the sex he has with the guy.
Is he stringing me along?

He says it was clear to him, but appreciates my honesty; I reply that I&amp;#39;ll have to make peace with the fact that me and my bf aren&amp;#39;t working out, and that me and him aren&amp;#39;t gonna happen either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internet guy says that&amp;#39;s still up for debate, as the guy he&amp;#39;s seeing may turn out to be a dick etc. He then proceeds to tell me about their sex, drop innuendos, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now I&amp;#39;m sitting here thinking what the fuck, he&amp;#39;s been stringing me along the whole time.
How can you be so inconsiderate when I made sure to never say anything about my love life that could make him uncomfortable?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My guess, which is pretty much proven now, is that this guy loves the attention, feels empowered to have me doubting my relationship for him, and that nothing good will ever come out of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the long rant, I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; needed to get this off my chest; to those who will downvote/heckle me for getting into this mess while being with my bf, I didn&amp;#39;t ask for this.
I&amp;#39;m not on the apps, never took any opportunity to hurt him, reject every proposition when I&amp;#39;m out clubbing... I have never cheated in my whole life, and this is just uncharted territory for me.
I&amp;#39;m lost, and I&amp;#39;d really love some insight and help here. Thanks to all of you who made it to here!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: me and the bf are going through a pretty rough patch, a guy adds me on fb, we start talking, he likes me, I turn him down, then I realize I&amp;#39;m getting attached, he won&amp;#39;t shut up about the guy he&amp;#39;s seeing now. I cut communications.
Today after 20 days or radio silence I get back in touch and explain that I disappeared because I acknowledged the feelings I had for him.
He knew all along, and then proceeds to talk about the sex he has with the guy.
Is he stringing me along?&lt;/p&gt;
