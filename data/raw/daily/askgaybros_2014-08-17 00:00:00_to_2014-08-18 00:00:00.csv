After I found his facebook profile, I proceeded to stalk his page heavily. Told my friends how I was very interested and asked them to invite me to their gatherings or whatever so I can see him. After a week of waiting, I decided i couldn't wait anymore and introduced myself on facebook and told him i was a mutual friend. It went well. He mentioned he was going over to our mutual friends house and I said maybe I could meet you there. I asked my friend if I could come over if it's okay with you etc. She told to wait until we we're in a public area so her friends can meet me too and that having the three of us alone would be awkward. I agreed, seeing how was too nervous and not ready enough to meet him. 


The next day, i decided to chat with again asking him about his interests, about him, about his school and talked about my intrests and we had a lot in common. I told him i was happy that i was talking to him and after him asking why, i explained the whole matchmaking ordeal and told him it was a week ago and i've wanted to talk to him since his facebook page was so adorable and cute. He told me he hoped he lived up to my expectations and how he's just being himself. I told he doesn't have to try being someone else and he said ""That's great, then!"" This is where i feel like I messed up. I told him genuine and real people appeal to me. He was like ""yeah, i think most people want that."" He said he needed to go eat something and that we could talk later. 

I felt like shit after that happened? I feel so insecure for some reason. I know it was great that i told him i liked him and that i had the guts to even talk to him. But, we haven't met in real life and i just feel like a fool.

I come to you today with a throwaway for help with a situation I am dealing with.

There's this guy I met on Grindr three years ago, as a freshman in college, and we've had an on-off fuck buddy situation going on since.  He's a super cool dude and I've grown to appreciate him as a person as well, so while I wouldn't call us friends, I would say we were more than just a recurring hook up.

I took last semester off, told him about it, and his response was that we would have to reconnect when I came back.  Partway through the 8 months I was away from school, we talked over Grindr and expressed how much we missed each other and how we were both looking forward to seeing each other again.  Now that I'm back, I'm looking for him on Grindr and he seems to have deleted his account.  Its still in my favorites, but he hasn't logged on in three weeks.

So...last night I drunkenly tracked him down over Facebook.  I knew his name and where he lived, and his name was uncommon enough that I've found him, with a profile picture that is definitely him.  

Now for my question:  Would it be super fucking creepy if I were to just message him out of the blue on Facebook?  I wanna send him a message and ask if he deleted his Grindr account and whether that meant he wasn't interested in meeting up anymore.  I want to contact him because I was really, really looking forward to sleeping with him again and hanging out again, but I don't know how he would feel if I just randomly contacted him out of the blue via a social network we've never connected on.

Even after all kinds of therapy, pills, and socializing with gay people. In fact, those things just made me feel worse about myself. I came out way before I was ready. In fact, I probably still am not, and regret coming out deeply. I came out before I could even say the words ""I'm gay"" out loud. I still cringe internally even just typing it, and I feel like I die a little inside every time I say it.

 I have very strong issues with depression, anxiety, and being suicidal, and that is for sure making the whole thing a LOT harder.

Even the therapists who claimed to have a lot of experience with gay clients became extremely uncomfortable and quickly changed the topic whenever I mentioned my sexual orientation (yaaay conservative state)

I don't know what to do or how to deal with it. How can you live knowing something is intrinsically and incurably wrong with you? (Wrong as in ""incorrect"", not morally or anything). Spending time around gay men and gay couples made me completely give up on the idea of gay love or romance. First of all because the relationships I've seen and read about are all messes/fake and on top of that I feel like I'm too ugly to attract anyone in the first place, on top of gay men being a statistically miniscule portion of the population. It seems inevitable that I'll grow old and die alone and unwanted because of being gay.

Moreover, being apart of one of the most hated groups on the planet kind of just makes me feel justified in hating myself for it. Despite the whole ""society becoming more tolerant"" we are still hated by the vast majority, and the fact that humanity has to learn not to hate and be disgusted by us makes me feel worse.

I don't know what to do, so I am asking for your thoughts and advise. I've gotten to the point where I get so stressed out thinking about these things I'll feel like I need to vomit, and the littlest things will send me into a hysterical fit of sobbing. I could never go back to therapy, I don't think they can help me and it all seems like a snake oil scam to begin with.

I love long sessions, but I'm afraid that'll never happen with a roommate.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys, I&amp;#39;m thinking about investing in a fleshlight (need advice on picking one, too!) but I&amp;#39;m not sure if its worth it with having a dorm roommate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He seems cool, but he&amp;#39;s also straight and we haven&amp;#39;t exactly talked about masturbation habits. Would I be able to hide it/have time for it? Are they worth the money? They seem like a ton of fun, but I don&amp;#39;t want to get one if I can&amp;#39;t ever find the time for it (you can&amp;#39;t just cum and dump, you have to clean them too)...honestly, I guess that ties into the whole masturbation in general thing, how do I schedule the time for it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love long sessions, but I&amp;#39;m afraid that&amp;#39;ll never happen with a roommate.&lt;/p&gt;

Holidays and weekends are such a bummer because no one messages me unless it's for school related stuff and no one asks me to hang out with them unless it's those once in a rainbow moon type of cases. 

Weekdays I'm alright because at least I have some friends that I talk to, and enjoy the company with, but aren't necessarily the type that goes beyond the 'good friend' boundary into the close and best friend range. No one I text on a daily basis. When I read some article in /r/introvert saying that 1/10 do not have a best friend, and realising that I'm part of that 1/10, it really sucked. Even the most quiet of my friends have best friends from their secondary and primary school days till present. 

I guess I never really made much friends during my schooling years due to my quiet personality, and it's getting to me now. Just today I spent the day at home studying without a single social interaction through messaging and whatnot. Sucks that I usually have to initiate the conversation for any of the such to happen. 

There's always these common advice things I read about similar situations along the lines of finding people with similar interests, but I'll be damned if anyone in this small and backwards country that shares this weird range of interests I have (languages, japanese idols, automotive stuff, see?) enough to have more than superficial conversation with. It's coming to the end of the final year in this school so there's little to no social situations outside of my classmates to make any new friends too..


This turned into quite a bit of a ramble there, I'm sorry. But this crushing loneliness is getting hard to handle each time it gets to the end of the week and I fear I might be falling back into depression again. sigh.
