I feel really conceited doing this because, ""why would anyone care about an update thread revolving around me etc."" but I wanted to truly say thank you to all of you who replied. 

I got my test results back today, all negative. I feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders (although there is that still niggling feeling that perhaps the window period is longer so I'll go back and get re-tested in a month's time). 

The strategies I found most helpful for stress reduction were meditation, distraction (with things such as video games) and talking to people. I reached out to the free mental health services offered at my university, and they've been really helpful in organise my issues and recognising why I feel angry/stressed etc. and strategies to cope. 

I still haven't gotten over my sickness, but they're running several tests and I should know why I'm ill in a couple of days (Hoping it resolves itself in the meantime). 


I just wanted to give a sincerely heartfelt thanks to everybody who offered their own advice/stories.

It made me uncomfortable just with us, but today when we were hanging out with my best friend (who is black) he couldn't even filter himself.  
  
He's definitely obsessed with rap music and grew up in what is basically very working class/blue collar society, but it's no excuse. He made my friend extremely uncomfortable and then had the balls to say that if her people can use it casually (which I disagree with anyway...I don't think anyone should use the word) that he has a right to as well. That it's just a word and that he is using it in an okay context (he says ""what's up my n word"" to his friends a lot).  
  
I don't want this to be a deal breaker, but he made my friend extremely uncomfortable and honestly we are so close that I would choose her over him. When I tried talking about it he just made the same excuses.

So, as per usual, after a long stretch with no dating luck, two guys asked me out in the same week. Figures. I'm really attracted to both of them, and they both seem like great guys. I've gone on two dates with Guy #1, and there is mutual interest to continue seeing each other and a good amount of chemistry. I met Guy #2 for the first time on Saturday. I was really nervous for some reason and thought I made a bad impression, but still really enjoyed the date. It turns out he enjoyed it too and asked me out for a second date. I realize this is ""good"" problem to have, but it still bothers me a bit.

My question for you bros is: how do you handle these situations, or how would you? Do you continue to see both people, assuming there has been no discussion of exclusivity, until you make a decision? How long would you feel comfortable seeing both guys?

Looking at it from the other side, at what point would you be angry if you found out a guy you were seeing was also seeing other guys?

I've been dating my boyfriend for about a year and a half. We are each other's first. We met at a smaller club at college, but we both graduated at the beginning of summer, so we've been long-distance for a few months. 

Don't get me wrong- I don't have a need to be in every aspect of his life. We lived in neighboring buildings while at school and hung out almost every night, but he had his own friends and I had mine. I would tag along sometimes (and the reverse), but he would also go to hang out with them by himself, which is perfectly normal. For whatever reason, though, pretty much all of friends were girls. I know what you might be thinking, but he's really not that flamboyant (not that it matters). I wouldn't *exactly* call him a bro, but he's not some walking stereotype or anything. 

Just some more relevant background information: for the entire one and a half years, he only had a single roommate. The roommate was completely straight and had a girlfriend. On top of that, I got along really well with him and even though he was my boyfriend's friend first and foremost, I was comfortable around him and I think it would have been safe to call us friends, or at least good acquaintances. There's also the fact that I met him just a week or so before I started dating my boyfriend, so it's not like my already-boyfriend was just moving in with some random dudes.

Anyhow, my boyfriend and I moved back to our separate homes at the beginning of summer. It was fine because we went from both being surrounded by people and each other, to being more or less isolated at the same time. 

Here's where it gets a bit tricky for me. He's going to grad school for chemistry, and I'm entering the work force in my state. A week ago, his sister and him moved him into his new grad school. He has four guy roommates (well, one will be leaving after the first month), and he gets along with them pretty well apparently. I'm not threatened by them because he's not very horny and isn't the type to cheat at all (I am as sure of this as I am of my skin color). They're also all straight, apparently, and he doesn't find any of them attractive. To be clear, I did not demand this information from him- we talk about our celebrity crushes, types and whatnot occasionally.

I don't know why, but I just feel... weird about it. Can somebody tell me why? Please? I don't think I feel threatened by them, but I can't help but think that they have the opportunity to be better ""friends"" with him in a day-to-day context. Maybe that's it?

I've started to actualize that plan and start talking with my family. But now, I'm not sure what to do next.

I started lining up housing deals sub $500 a month and to my luck there's plenty in Pittsburgh. And I did more research on working with my Pharm Tech with my friends who are also pharmtechs, with 11 dollars an hour minimum after three months of training I could live comfortably if I work at least 50 hours a month which isn't bad. It just takes a bit of time to get to that point. (Almost an entire school year.)

The problem is that after seeing the light at the end of the tunnel I decided it would be best to talk to my father. My father's response: I'm going to let you grow up and hope you make the *right* decision. This was after my brothers pressured him into not being stupid. But, despite their divorce my father directly went to tell my mother, and my mother being the dramatic woman she is then brought in my aunt and uncle. I lied to my aunt and uncle to save my family's face. Yes, I live in one of those types of cultures. (I am Middle Eastern and African, so my family is just the right mix of ignorance and deadly devotion). But, since my mother pressed me alone, I decided to tell her. I was angry when I told her because she hurt me. All the anti-gay bullshit, the constant rejection whenever I tried to get her to see my point, and eventually due to my frustration my alms were lost. I wanted her to reject me. I wanted her to throw me out. Because at this point I am tired. I don't want to deal with this anymore

Her statement (being a devout hellfire christian) was that being gay is demonic, this was the work of the devil, I just haven't found the right woman, I am mistaken and young, it's just a phase. Nothing I haven't heard before. What she said next is what's eating at me, my mother has lived a shitty, scandal-filled, dramatic life. I am her only son (yes, cue-in biblical Jesus, I have a host of half brothers and half sisters because of said scandalous life) I am supposed to redeem her life by being successful and marrying a woman. She promptly started crying so it was obvious that nothing else was going to get to her. The general consensus is to keep supporting me and letting me go back to college. But even as I type this they're calling a league of pastors to deliberate on my life, to cure me of the gay, and I still have a whole line of interrogations to get through. I still want to leave, but I don't want to be charged with *forsaking* my mother. (Because whenever we have this discussion she deflates like a balloon, and I honestly get scared she's going to go into room, have a heart-attack, and drop dead. I don't want to be blamed for that pain, when it's not even my fault in the first place.) And ultimately they're still supporting me, just on the condition I marry a woman at the end of the day. I am not sure if I should still try to support myself.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intro: I recently had a coming out scare and I decided it would be best to become independent. I&amp;#39;ve started to actualize that plan and start talking with my family. But now, I&amp;#39;m not sure what to do next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started lining up housing deals sub $500 a month and to my luck there&amp;#39;s plenty in Pittsburgh. And I did more research on working with my Pharm Tech with my friends who are also pharmtechs, with 11 dollars an hour minimum after three months of training I could live comfortably if I work at least 50 hours a month which isn&amp;#39;t bad. It just takes a bit of time to get to that point. (Almost an entire school year.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that after seeing the light at the end of the tunnel I decided it would be best to talk to my father. My father&amp;#39;s response: I&amp;#39;m going to let you grow up and hope you make the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; decision. This was after my brothers pressured him into not being stupid. But, despite their divorce my father directly went to tell my mother, and my mother being the dramatic woman she is then brought in my aunt and uncle.

But I'm me, and we all work in different ways!

About two months back I started talking to a guy who clearly stated he wasn't looking for anything in particular. We spoke every day for a month or so, then eventually met and I had one of the most enjoyable days I've ever had in my life. Nothing sexual, just walking around, talking, getting food. I'll admit I started having (and still do) feelings for the guy, far too soon, The day we met every little thing he said or did made me smile and I was happy to just be in his presence. 

I've never kissed anyone, or been anywhere near any sort of relationship above a friendship. A kiss is very special and I told the guy this. About half way into the day we kissed and cuddled, and continued doing so until I returned home. The couple of days after we met the guy was extremely quiet and a little off, I just let him get on with it as I wasn't expecting much (I'm an extremely pessimistic person, sadly). Then after that we carried on talking, all day every day and I started thinking more and more about him, until he was the only thing on my mind. I questioned him about the odd two days, and he said he needed to think whether it was time for him to carry on and give things a shot, which he decided it was. (He recently had a bad experience with someone he was dating on a night out and is still 'recovering').

Some more time passed and we continued talking, calling, playing games together and arranged to stay at one anthers. Then a week or so ago, during a call he told me there was something he had to tell me, but refused to say it on the phone. Eventually he messaged me what it was and basically asked if we could be friends, and that he is trying to love me but he just can't, mostly down to the issues with his 'ex', but also because he's not completely physically attracted to me; though my personality is perfect.

I'm babbling on here and trying to think of ways to shorten it, but it's a little difficult...

That, really, really upset me. Probably more than it should have done, but it did anyway. I'd spoken previously to the guy about changes I'm making to myself (mostly my appearance), and one I questioned him on what the issues with me were (probably a massive mistake on my behalf) they were essentially what I had said to him I was tackling. 

I could add a tonne more to this, about how I feel and the things I want to do. But for now I won't. I'd just like to know what I should do? I still talk to the guy and attempt to keep how I really feel hidden, with hope that once I've fixed the issues I have with myself he'll fall madly in love with me.

Should I just stop all contact? Which honestly would be extremely difficult. Do I carry on as I have been, thinking about this guy constantly, hoping that where I am where I want to be, it'll work out? Or do I do something else? Sorry for the rambling, but it'd be nice to hear what some complete strangers things. My friends all seem to be overly defensive of me, so I'm not sure I can listen completely to what they say.

So... yeah...

Help? :)

EDIT: I realise two months is a really short period of time to have such great feelings for someone, I think I have some personal issues with attachment, which I should also work on. But hey-ho!

Should also add that this is the first experience I've had like this. I've never been on a 'date' before and nor have I had feelings for anyone like this.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before I start, I&amp;#39;d like to point out that a lot of people probably think I&amp;#39;m being completely pathetic and it&amp;#39;s pointless me asking for advice when other people have much more serious, pressing issues.
