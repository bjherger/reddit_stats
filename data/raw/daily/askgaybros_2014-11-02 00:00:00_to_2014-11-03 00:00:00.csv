After a long time of texting back and forth I finally asked him on date, he said yes. The date went really well and I invited him back to my place, we talked for hours and cuddled. We repeated this activity several times before we got intimate. Were both really shy but I had to initiate everything, I was starting to think that we were way more than just friends after a few weeks. We were seeing each other every other day for a while, he never asked me if I wanted to spend time but never said 'no' either. One day he sent me message asking 'what do you think about us? I think we should just be friends"" I think I replied ""I would be content with being friends."" A few days later I asked him if he wanted to do anything and didn't get a response in over 24 hours, I got unreasonably upset and wrote him a letter expressing my feelings about this relationship. I put it under his door and didn't get a response until I asked him if he read it. I think he responded, ""i like you, but I'm just not ready to commit right now idk""  Probably a week later I asked him if he wanted to get together, just as friends, and he said that he wasn't interested 'right now.' This hit me right in the feels and of course I didn't take it very well. I haven't talked to him since with the exception of asking him about something in our class. I have to see him two times a week in our lecture and it kills me when he walks by. I don't think he has any idea how much this has affected me, the feeling of loving and being loved, and then having that taken away without explanation. Maybe I came on too strong? I asked him if I appeared that way and he said I didn't so I don't even know. He lives a five minute walk from my place and I've been so tempted to knock but i don't want to be that stalker that doesn't go away.

I hope this doesn't come across as rambling but I am just going to type and try not to over-think too much. I apologize in advice for this is a long wall-of-text.

Basically, I am at a complete loss. I don't know what I am, I feel as I if I am sexually and emotionally beyond repair. I have been completely confused as to what I am as long as I can remember. I thought it would naturally sort itself out with age but so far I still feel like a lost and isolated kid now in my late 20's. I don't even know where to start looking for answers. Even more distressing my sexual identity problems go far beyond just if I am gay/straight/bi/etc..for the last 12-13 years of my life I struggled with unsalvageable low self-esteem, horrible depression, long periods of celibacy and loneliness and adult virginity into my mid 20's. I have never been in any relationship in my life. Therapy and medication hasn't helped me one bit so I have pretty much ruled it out at this point.

Now I am basically trying to figure out what I am so I will try to sum up my odd history as best as a I can. As a teenager I always had crushes on girls and wanted a girlfriend but considered myself too ugly and short to have any value to girls. I was around tons of guys and friends with tons of guys and never really had a crush or found myself sexually attracted to them in person. I couldn't imagine doing anything sexual with one of my guy friends or a guy I meet or anything. I dormed and traveled with guys and never really once had the inclination to experiment with them or even feel any sexual attraction towards them. There have been countless girls I wanted to do things with but due to shyness and possibly my ugliness, I never got very far with any I was interested in. Now when it comes to porn and masturbating (which is what I did from age 12 to 23 with no real life experience) I am all over the place. I liked straight porn, lesbian porn, gay porn, transexual porn, fetish, basically everything, all of it turned me on and could still turn me on. I would go through stages where all I would watch would be straight for weeks, then strictly gay, then weird fetishes...When out and about I never usually find myself checking out guys the same way I do women, or getting flustered and nervous talking to guys the same way I do women, but then when I watch porn I am sexually attracted to some of the acts men do with one another. 

When I get very depressed about being lonely, it is usually due to the fact I don't and never had a girlfriend. When I see couples out and my friends with their significant others I get really down. In my early 20's I was so depressed and shameful about my lack of intimacy and inexperience I started seeing prostitutes. All women, but I was so nervous and not used to being with other people sexually that I was unable to perform a lot of the time and again wonder if it could be because I may gay. I still am all over the place with porn and get aroused by different types. After being with a few prostitutes now I am bit more comfortable being touched by someone else and relaxing but I am still very confused. I really like kissing women and can't really imagine being too turned on kissing a guy, I really like performing and receiving oral sex with women but would definitely not be opposed to receiving from a guy. Penetration with a women has been difficult because of my nerves and condoms basically numb any sensation I would feel and penetration with another guy never really interested me, even in gay porn I would mainly focus on the oral acts and skip the anal penetration. I am debating maybe seeing a male prostitute to see if maybe I would enjoy it, maybe if I don't have performance anxiety like I do with women then I would have my answers? I don't know... I like performing weird fetish stuff with some of the prostitutes I see, them dominating me/performing anilingus on them/finger and toe sucking...again could this be a sign of something else?

This is all very confusing. I really wouldn't have any qualms about being gay or straight or whatever, I just kind of want a concrete answer of what I am but I suppose that is an unrealistic way of wanting things as I suppose sexuality is hardly ever concrete. I suppose as it stands now I would be labeled bisexual but I don't even know if I am that considering I don't feel too much physical attraction toward men or their form or desire to get into a relationship with one, just the idea of a few sex acts with them if that makes any sense. Eh, pretty distressing...I really don't feel I belong anywhere. I feel if I was gay maybe I wouldn't be as lonely as I have never had trouble making guy friends and I am not nervous and timid around men and they seem to genuinely like me unlike women who mostly have no use for me romantically. But Idk if my getting on with guys better is just in terms of friendship or not, maybe I would have just as much trouble sexually/romantically attracting a man and have nothing to offer anyone? I don't think I could ever get a girl to see anything in me and with my impotence problems and inexperience I could never satisfy her. Eh my head is literally spinning thinking about all of this.

We both occasionally text the usual pleasantries (""good morning"" ""how was your day?"" etc). Sometime he calls to tell me his work issues.

Basically we're in contact except not texting the previous terms of endearment and other stuff couples text about.

Anyway, it now feels like I can't move on. I am dating other guys but there's this thought deep at the back of my head wishing he'd text me to say he'd want to be together again, and I'd say yes.

However, he might have found someone else since he posted to Facebook about it. I texted him about that and he said a cousin hacked his account and posted it. (But he still didn't delete it.)

I may also be forgetting the reasons why we broke up. The lack of common interests. His immaturity. I'm 26 and established, he's 22 and out of college, starting a career. 

One day I told my mom about him (a big coming out moment). My mom cried and refused to talk to me. When I told him about this he refused to speak to me for days because I barred him from calling at home until my mom talks to me again. I was crying for days, he was not responding.

One day, he invited me over to his house and didn't talk to me but asked me to watch him play video games instead. That's when I realized I'm not that in love anymore. There was also some trust issues on my part, because I felt like he was using me to buy him stuff or food (he denied this, saying he was just used to older friends treating him all the time).

He also left his Facebook account logged in on my iPad for a while and I could see all his chats. That was fun. Some chats when we were still on and happy. A chat to an old gay guy asking for ""allowance"".

I think I need to cut all ties with him but I just can't do it. I miss his touch that feel electric. We have a spark between us that I fear will never come again. I've never felt it again among the new guys I've been seeing.

One more thing: I got him an extension to my phone line one time. He still has that line, and I pay the bills. I let it be because I will still pay it even if I take the sim card from him. He tells me he uses the line very carefully so I won't pay much. (I know this is pathetic but I want that connection to him. I'm waiting for the contract to end before cutting the line. Also wishing he'd lose the sim at one point.)

Please tell me if you have had similar experiences, or if you think I'm pathetic and I need a blow to the head to wake me up.

I've been having sleepless nights for weeks now thinking about what to do.

This is a throwaway (because), so some background: all the relationships I've actually been in before have tended to be with friends of friends or with friends that have grown closer.

Lately however, having moved to a new city, I've started dating using Grindr (yes, actual dating â€“ it happens) but have never really succeeded in turning a date into something long term (aside from occasional sex). I've come to the conclusion that as you don't really 'bump' into each other and hang out casually as we have no mutual friends, or didn't meet because of the same activities (gym/climbing/etc) it's hard to sustain interest.

Just wondering if anyone has managed to overcome this challenge with any regularity? i.e. turning a grindr date into a friend and after that maybe even a boyfriend?

Then, to the problem.

It's all messy. There's no way to do, y'know, a full factorial design on my life. The truth may just be ""you have [brain problems](http://nedroid.com/2007/03/beartato-63/),"" and I'm stuck with this crap. That said, I tried going to psychotherapy, and I don't think it would be inaccurate to say that I was just paying somebody to pretend to be my friend. I can spend my time introspecting, repeating ""epiphanies"" I've already had as if they're new. Maybe this is another in that series.. but that's the information available to me, so that's the only way I can make decisions.. I guess I feel like this one might be worthwhile because it's growing out of information that **isn't** available to me. I fixate on my failures, because that used to get results, and because that's what I have -- my experience of myself, emotionally, is a pretty narrow band on the spectrum. The negative space here is, y'know, feeling like not-shit.

The times I remember at least not being unhappy involved some group of friends.  The last year of high school was okay for the most part, having bumped into a group of people who were all taking a similar ridiculous schedule. In retrospect, I was being used a little, as far as homework was concerned, but it may have been that my gullibility was symptomatic of being starved for contact with my peer group. 

Undergrad was made complicated. My mom was diagnosed with cancer the summer before my first semester; freshman year was pretty miserable. I think my sophomore and junior years were okay. The cancer went into remission for a little while, I got my mom to do yoga by going through routines with her, and we worked on eating differently after having read some of the cancer literature. I had stumbled into two or three friends, we did fun things sometimes, mostly games. I spent nearly all of my weekends at home, took care of things my mom wasn't really able to do after surgeries and chemotherapy.

My sister described the time after the diagnosis like.. lying down on train tracks, knowing the train is coming. You can hear it, you can see it, but you're not really sure how far away it is or when you're going to be hit. It's just coming, and you're waiting to be destroyed. My mom passed in the second semester of my senior year. 
I was admitted as a PhD student to a university several states over for the fall semester of the same year.  I even got funding! I thought: I can leave the reminders of the loss behind, I'll have plenty of work to distract myself with, I'll get paid to learn things, sounds like a good time.



They don't tell you that a lot of graduate students feel like shit all the time. Or that the suicide rate is several times higher than in the general population.  At several points the only thing that kept me from killing myself was that the logistics of liquidating my crap so I could hand money off to my sisters was too much of a pain in the ass. Hence, the psychotherapy. I didn't really bond with my classmates in any meaningful way. Too busy hating myself for failing, I guess, and for a recent admission to myself of my homosexuality, I guess, and [for a laundry list of really dumb shit, I guess](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rrvRFHckwVQ/Tqm9Nd-1dUI/AAAAAAAAGb4/JkjDArUV3Zk/s1600/sad21alt.png), generated by the singularity at the center of this gravity well of FEELINGS.. I guess.  I left with a master's, then moved away again for a job a few months ago.


So, why the fuck, you ask, am I posting this in askgaybros.  Well, I can recall my first crush, in middle school, on a boy, and then I can recall avoiding that as hard as I could. I can recall running into gay porn on the internet, and masturbating to it, and not coming to extremely obvious conclusions. I can realize now that I had a huge thing for one of my roommates in college, because he was deeply kind and really cute... and I can be glad I didn't understand that that was happening, because it would have exploded in my face in the same year that everything else was going to hell.


And there's that fucking adorable grad student in the year under me who I would see in the lab being tall and thin and cute and gaaaaay. And largely disinterested. And I had this histrionic, almost entirely internal, reaction to every little thing he did and every interaction we didn't even really have and it was stupid. But he was the gadfly to my gay, and there I was, noting that at least I only have to come out to one parent.. eventually.


I can easily say that the nature of grad school and the recent loss of my mom were fucking it all up, sure.  I was paddling upstream. But I've moved again, to another new state, to a different stream, and I'm still a shitfuck sadsack. So.. the stream is not the problem? My paddling technique is? I haven't known anybody I can call a friend for 3 years or so, now.. is this a human need I've never bothered to address, because I was never under enough stress for the cracks to spread?


And now all I can think of is all the time I wasted. 


So, you'll say, go make friends.. but I don't really know how.  It seems natural for other people, but I don't really have interests that are social, and I don't drink, which makes bars kind of boring as all fuck.. I'll try cultivating new interests, though previous attempts have crumpled against a wall of ""you are awkward and terrible and boring and can't you see how much of an alien you are, how much everyone else sees it?"" So I default to being full-up on apathy, which fails.  And even if I made friends with somebody, opening up just means all of this fucking sad starts spewing out, all over the place, inappropriately, and no one wants to fucking touch that.


But there are these blips, where OH LOOK AT THAT CUTE GUY and suddenly I'm in middle school, back at the point where I started ignoring cute guys, confused because I've just got this eruption of feelings that I can't parse.  I guess this is lust? Where does interest in the person begin? I don't **really** want to sex up this person I don't know, do I? Seems like I do.  Oh, well, then, here, have all of the regular social anxiety except **worse** because what if this person you don't know doesn't LIKE YOU WHAT WOULD HAPPEN THEN. And what if SEX but you don't know anything about SEX because you [fucked](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-XyWbMlbOEy4/TqmSIFPPgCI/AAAAAAAAGa4/TmwsD2mOAH0/s1600/sad24alt.png) up you [stupid fucker](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-GqSW45riQ0U/TqjXax2onMI/AAAAAAAAGYU/n9U8hNpbEv8/s1600/sad24.png). And I kind of want to scope out gay social groups, because that would be one less thing I feel like an alien for, but there's this.

This co-worker of mine became a confidante, and that's helped me a lot. When that relationship finally fell apart, he was also one of the friends who helped me get through.

Due to this, we got quite close and we have shared a lot. We also got a lot more physical. It started with flicking as a joke and to annoy him, and it became full on wrestle and tickle-fights. I've even told him that I'm highly sensitive and he has seen that I get aroused when he tickles me, but he still does it as he sees it as a way to win.

As we got closer, people around us started to comment because we behaved like a couple. I believe I've gotten so attached to him that when we're not seen together, they'd ask why/where the other person is. It was also around the time I realized that my feelings for this friend might not be as simple and platonic. I've started to see him as someone I'd like to be with romantically because of how comfortable his company is to me.

The thing is, he has told me that he is straight since I came out to him, and I know that I shouldn't try to find things to prove otherwise as that'll be disrespectful on many levels. There are some ""weird"" things that my gut feeling is telling me to be aware of certain points of attention; like he doesn't maintain any close real-life friendships, and that he is texting with another guy in a way that doesn't seem like they're just friends (He claims it's his online BFF but the conversations are less than platonic, it seems).

It caused a lot of conflicted feelings and I felt that I needed to tell him. An opportunity presented itself, and I told him a lot of things. He was patient and listened to me ramble on for hours. At the end of it, he doesn't seem to be too affected by it. While he repeated that he is straight, we are still as close (well save for less physical contact as we both agreed it probably looks too weird for the others around us), and he has even made a few jokes about the situation in an effort to make it less awkward between us.

Part of me has resigned to the fact that he will never be able to return my feelings, while a part of me is still not giving up. I don't know why, but there are certain moments in our time together I really felt a spark and I guess I'm sad both because he won't feel the same and also because I don't think I can find someone else like him.

The move is in the works, but it might be a year before I'm able to do it.

I love travel, but travel isn't really easy either. I can afford a weekend driving trip about once a month. The problem is, I become a one-night stand, especially if I don't previously know anyone else in the place I'm visiting.

It would be great to know someone first through online, and then have a date weekend knowing I could count on hanging out with this guy or maybe even spending the weekend at his place. If I didn't have to come up with lodging, I would be able to afford to fly someplace further than the car can take me, since flights aren't terribly expensive and I live 10 minutes from an airport :)

So since everything is location based (Grindr, gaybros meetups, Adam4Adam, OKCupid... all of them require a location), how is it possible to find a good guy I'm attracted to, who happens to live in some other city (maybe one I've never even heard of)? The only think I can think of is randomly choosing a state/city and placing my location as that on OKCupid and Adam4Adam and maybe even Craigslist. Keep it set on that place for a week, see what happens, then reset it to somewhere else the next week. The downside to this is that some guys are going to see my location constantly changing and think I'm a fake or a flake.

&lt;p&gt;So since everything is location based (Grindr, gaybros meetups, Adam4Adam, OKCupid... all of them require a location), how is it possible to find a good guy I&amp;#39;m attracted to, who happens to live in some other city (maybe one I&amp;#39;ve never even heard of)? The only think I can think of is randomly choosing a state/city and placing my location as that on OKCupid and Adam4Adam and maybe even Craigslist. Keep it set on that place for a week, see what happens, then reset it to somewhere else the next week. The downside to this is that some guys are going to see my location constantly changing and think I&amp;#39;m a fake or a flake.
Any ideas bros?&lt;/p&gt;

I'm not out to him yet and I don't know who he really bats for...what to do?**

Hey Guys,

So I have a really, really confusing situation on my hands right now. As just some background, Im a 22 year guy who's bi and out to my family and close friends...but still working on coming out to everyone. I come across as pretty much straight, and everyone is surprised when I come out to them (which is kinda fun to see their reactions).

I'm a firefighter and one of my best friends works alot of shifts with me and also does EMS with me as well (we can call him Joe). Now I've known him for 3 years, we get along very well, and are very similar. For all I know he is apparently straight and only has talked about girls...but last night made me question Joe and our relationship.

I injured my legs playing hockey and my muscles were really sore. He knows some AT skills and offered to do deep muscle fascia release (which is amazing by the way). It was late last night in our quarters and he just offered, so I was very appreciative. We both help each other out, and we both trust each other alot. I didn't think of it at all in a sexual way, and I've never had a crush on him.

So I was in my bed, and he started working my legs and went inbetween my shorts to get all parts of my legs. I thought ""Ok Joe, that's cool."" He then forewarned me saying that he might accidentally bump into ""stuff"" to reach pressure points and says that his past patients don't always enjoy the experience. He mentioned that he knows we're good friends and had mutual trust to not make this ""weird"", and I agreed saying that I understood and I trusted him to just help a brother out.

Now typical friends don't put their hands down each others' boxers, but it went there for all pressure points to get reached. He then apologized at points as he grazed against my penis and pushed my balls gently out of the way to get to spots. I was a little taken aback, and at some points I couldn't help but get hard. He was working all in and around my package, but it was odd trying to keep in mind this was my best friend just trying to treat an injury. He sometimes would really graze up on my shaft or really plunge his hand down, almost on purpose it seemed, but still seemed professional about it. At one point he pulled down my boxers too and he became quite familiar with my endowment that was at points rock hard to get to my side legs.

After two hours of the treatment (which was really good) and chatting he asked about if my penis always curved the way it does. At this point I knew he definitely saw my boner and was kinda curious about its curve....and it hit me where this whole ordeal was quite odd even for the best of friends with a lot of trust with each other. It honestly felt like a subtle indirect move on me rather than a strict massage and I honestly loved it.

Now, I have no idea what I should do. He is my best friend, but I have not come out to him yet. Besides that fact that he probably does not suspect I am not straight...I have this odd pseudo sexual experience with him and in a spot where coming out after this could be awkward. I have no idea if he isn't straight...and maybe we will confess our mutually shared sexualities/feelings and lead into a hot love story of two firefighters that gets made into a movie.

i'm a masculine bottom (check out my gbgw pics) who really gets off on fun humiliation scenes that make me feel like a real cockhungry whore. i love the idea of games, and i've got a few ideas, but was wondering if other guys had ideas or games they'd done before. most of these would be best in a group where i'm the only bottom with a group of 3-5 tops, but some could probably work 1 on 1.

Here are a few of mine. I'm blindfolded for most of them, haha.

Marco Polo: I'm blindfolded and required to stay on all fours for the whole game. The tops have their dicks out and are standing and can move around. When I say Marco, the tops all have to say Polo. I crawl around and try to find their dicks with my open mouth. And actually there's probably a more humiliating call and response that'd be more fun. :)

Memorize the Cock: Again, blindfolded. Would work best with at least 5 tops. The guys line up and I memorize the feel of each cock in my mouth, either with the guy's name, or just a number. Then, at various points in the rest of the fun, they could stop at any point, shove a dick in my mouth, and make me guess whose it is. If I get it wrong there's some humiliating punishment. For an extra challenge, I also have to guess when the cocks go in my ass.

Ring Toss: I've seen special butt plugs that have a rod coming out of the ass, and a set of rings for a ring toss. I'd be ass up and try to catch the rings the guys throw.

Coin Toss: The guys line up one at a time. First guy flips a coin, and the coin determines which hole he pounds for 30 seconds: my mouth (heads, obviously) or tails (ass, duh). Once every guy has gone once, then the time increases to 1 minute. Then, after that, two guys flip a coin at a time, so I could get a dick in each end, or two in my mouth or two in my ass.

Some of you remember me (if not, please look at my post history). 

I was asking for help with my neighbor... And I have a new update. No, nothings happened yet, but we've became closer friends and the tension is stronger now that ever. I need your help.

I recently moved back into the complex and have taken a very strong approach. I really want this to happen with us, and I really think he does too. Remember, I still don't even know if he's gay but he's done a lot to make me suspect that he's into me. 

We go to the beach a lot and I blatantly see him checking me out all the time. He really doesn't even try to hide it. He's been making lots of awkward gay/hooking up jokes (i.e. while eating a banana, saying 'i've tried to get you to eat my banana for a while, etc.')

The other night, when we got back from the beach, tension was high. I went back to my place and he went back to his, and I talked to him on skype... Telling him how sore I was from the beach that day. Without hesitation, he told me he would give me a massage. I instantly said okay, and went with it. His exact quote was 'Meet me by the pool, strip down completely naked and I'll come rub you down.'

He might have been expecting me to say a joke back, but I instantly said 'Okay!' I told him not to stand me up and that I was heading out,  and signed off skype (essentially telling him I was really heading out).

My heart was pounding through my chest but I went out there, made a little noise, but he never came :(

Since then, I've brought it up in a semi-jokingly way and the last time we talked about it he apologized and said 'I'm sorry, I got nervous! I'll never stand you about again though.'

Nothing has happened since then, but if I can get him to come out when we're talking like that... I think something really will. 

Any suggestions? What would help make it obvious if you were in his shoes? 

Thanks so much guys.

Remember, I still don&amp;#39;t even know if he&amp;#39;s gay but he&amp;#39;s done a lot to make me suspect that he&amp;#39;s into me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We go to the beach a lot and I blatantly see him checking me out all the time. He really doesn&amp;#39;t even try to hide it. He&amp;#39;s been making lots of awkward gay/hooking up jokes (i.e. while eating a banana, saying &amp;#39;i&amp;#39;ve tried to get you to eat my banana for a while, etc.&amp;#39;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other night, when we got back from the beach, tension was high. I went back to my place and he went back to his, and I talked to him on skype... Telling him how sore I was from the beach that day. Without hesitation, he told me he would give me a massage. I instantly said okay, and went with it. His exact quote was &amp;#39;Meet me by the pool, strip down completely naked and I&amp;#39;ll come rub you down.&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He might have been expecting me to say a joke back, but I instantly said &amp;#39;Okay!&amp;#39; I told him not to stand me up and that I was heading out,  and signed off skype (essentially telling him I was really heading out).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My heart was pounding through my chest but I went out there, made a little noise, but he never came :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, I&amp;#39;ve brought it up in a semi-jokingly way and the last time we talked about it he apologized and said &amp;#39;I&amp;#39;m sorry, I got nervous! I&amp;#39;ll never stand you about again though.&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing has happened since then, but if I can get him to come out when we&amp;#39;re talking like that... I think something really will. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any suggestions? What would help make it obvious if you were in his shoes? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks so much guys.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm dating this guy. Things are good, and we have pretty good sex.  I usually top.  He cums.  Things are good.

But the other day, we were tipsy and browsing in a sex shop, and he playfully asked me if we could get a dildo.  I asked why, and he was like ""Our sex is great, but I really like how it feels to have a big one in me.""

I didn't really follow up, 'cause I didn't want to have an awkward drunk convo in a sex shop.  I'm not upset--I have to be honest, there's things about his body that I'm not incredibly thrilled with (i.e. his dick, actually; it's so big that I really don't much enjoy when he tops and it takes forever to get going.  To be honest, I'd love if it were smaller and he could just go at it, lol).  We still have great sex.  But better sex is never a bad thing, lol.  And if he'll get more pleasure from a big dildo every now and then, I'm fine with that.

BUT, it'd be a lot hotter for me if I could give him what he wants with my own dick, not with a piece of silicon.  So, guys who like the feel of a bigger dick, what's about it do you like?  And are there ways for guys with smaller dicks to do the same things? like with positions or technique or something?  

(I know I should ask him, but I'm sure he'll tell me ""don't worry about it, it's fine."")","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey, this is a little different than the usual size question.&lt;/p&gt;

I love you guys!

After ending a 4 year relationship ten months ago, I have been pretty devastated. I felt like my true being was attacked, and it really hurt me and changed my life. I was cheated on, lied to, had an STD scare, then told I was not attractive. He also made it a point to tell me what IS attractive (white and skinny) and broke up with me. 


I grew very depressed and had no idea what to do with myself. I developed some mental health issues that I didn't know how to handle. I tried talking to my friends about it but they couldn't get past ""he was a scumbag, just forget about him and move on."" I don't think they really understood how deeply hurt I was. I tried to hire a counselor who fucked up my first appointment which discouraged me from further trusting ""mental health professionals."" My work performance suffered during my biggest project at work. My boss understood because he also was going through a divorce. I never wanted to wake up in the morning or go to bed at night. My bedroom felt so empty all the time. I became a complete slob and never cleaned anything. I couldn't stop running every single memory of my ex through my head and crying constantly for months. I had a long talk with my doctor about what was going on with me, and after much resistance on my part I agreed to start taking antidepressant Citalopram and seek another mental health professional about a month ago. 


Although I have been very much against antidepressants due to the research I've done in the past, I honestly think the Citalopram is helping me a lot. I've been taking it for about a month now and after the first week I started feeling ""reset."" My mind has been less manic, I've been able to accept that the relationship is over, and able to focus on moving on with my life. I'm glad to say that things are mostly back in order for me. My room and bathroom are completely spotless now :-P 


This doesn't change the fact that I NEED LOVE AND INTIMACY. I'm just one of those people. I don't want to be alone. There is just too much love in my heart to not give some away to someone else. I honestly feel like I need (like... for survival) to share good feelings with another person. I don't want to do it alone. Remember that question on OK Cupid? ""How do you feel about falling in love?"" Well, my answer is ""I love it and want it very much."" Sorry bros, I have no idea how to contain all of this love I have into my own person. 


Anywho, I've been trying to find a friend worth getting close to and sharing this love with. And I've seriously been trying everything. Gay bars, bear bars, LGBT community groups, every internet facet imaginable, having friends introduce me to people, etc. I'm guessing that everyone in my college town prefers white and skinny, because I have literally never got a message or a reply from anyone online in my city. Seriously. Not even one. Yesterday, I decided to just pack up my shit and go visit a bigger city. I didn't have any plans at all, just to get here and look around. I hopped on Google Maps, chose a city, hopped on Expedia, booked an awesome hotel in downtown Tampa, filled up my car and got on the road. I got here, got settled in, had a few drinks at my hotel bar, and came back to the room to check out this city online. In the mean time I hopped on craigslist and posted the same ad for friends/buds that I had been posting in my city, and the first reply I got (20 minutes later) was surprisingly awesome. I called the guy and we just chatted and already found a lot in common. He is also here visiting family and just looking for someone to chill with. I told him that Im not looking for sex (I'm way to fucked mentally to be sexual with anyone still) and he said thats ok, lets just hang out. Oh yeah, did I mention that he's white and skinny? ;)


He showed up at my hotel about 30 minutes later and we just chilled. We watched some cartoons and cuddled and just chatted for many, many hours. He then admitted that he absolutely love my body and was very attracted to me. (I was shocked... no one likes fat black guys.) I really liked his too and we just felt so connected in attraction. Next thing you know its like a porn scene in my hotel. Oh my god we had the best sex I have ever had in my life. It felt so intimate and special the entire time. When we were done and cuddling again he admitted that it was his first time with a guy and thanked me for the introduction. After chatting some more it turns out that he actually lives 45 minutes away from my city and we plan to keep in touch. We cuddled all night and did it again this morning before I took him home. He's coming over again tonight after visiting some more family. I'm not going to expect anything serious to happen between us, but at least I have made an awesome friend. He's 19 (I'm 24) and probably just figuring out his sexuality and I'm glad I could help.


Anywho, to wrap up this terribly long post, I just want to thank all of you gaybros for being awesome and chatting with me about stuff over the months. I'm using a throwaway to post this unfortunately but you all have been so kind and special and helpful during my time of need. I wish I could gather all of you together in one place and make you awesome drinks and food. Thank you all for the support, advice, and your own posts which also has been helping me a lot.
