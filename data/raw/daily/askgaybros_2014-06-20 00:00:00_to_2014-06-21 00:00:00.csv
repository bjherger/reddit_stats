I'm pretty sure he caught staring at him while he was at the drinking fountain in the hallway, because he politely introduced himself as I was scurrying back to my room in embarrassment. I didn't think much of it until we hung out exclusively the following weekend (a 3 day weekend, in fact) and I developed feelings for him. I thought it was strange that he said he had considered going home that weekend but changed his mind.

We continued to get to know each other better as the weeks passed, and our conversations grew very personal. He opened up and talked about some of his problems, including wanting to live in the woods and needing to grow ""steel balls"" and say what he wanted to say. I was convinced he was trying to come out to me, but he was hesitant to elaborate on the latter comment. Still, we bonded over our similarities in dry humor and sarcasm, as well as our largely ""lone wolf"" lifestyles.

Another thing I thought was strange was that he didn't have a cell phone or use social media, so every time we hung out I knew I had his complete attention. He insisted that I climb trees with him since that's one of his favorite hobbies, and I eventually gave in to his requests once I realized he wouldn't take no for an answer. There, we delved into highly philosophic debates and spent many hours above ground, knowing nobody would bother us. One time after we got haircuts together, we climbed into a tree and started drawing attention to us. Though I was embarrassed by him spreading rumors to strangers that we had gotten ice cream and were now sitting in a tree, I couldn't help but think about how cute that sounded coming from his mouth.

On a cold, rainy night, the fire alarms went off - not a drill - and we were forced away from our dorms for a few hours. Being an idiot, I panicked and didn't think to grab a jacket. My friend saw that and told me not to worry, first warming my arms up with his hands and then hugging me to keep me warm in front of our friends. All of us proceeded to get food to kill time. My friend decided to give me several more long, unwarranted hugs in the cafeteria. Again, I was embarrassed, but I didn't budge because it felt so good. Later, he complained about not liking his ice cream and asked if he could lick the ice cream off my spoon instead. I only said no from a germaphobe standpoint, but I still gave him a sample.

The two of us walked across campus for dinner a couple weeks later. When we returned, I was taken aback by his roommate asking how our date was. A week after that, my friend asked me to climb up his bed and check out a contraption he set up for his alarm. His roommate, again, warned me that my friend ""is trying to get in bed with you."" Maybe his roommate knew something I didn't? On another occasion, I walked in on my roommates and a couple other people wondering if my new friend is gay and commenting about how quirky he is.

He has talked about not liking his personal bubble popped, but this personal bubble has often not applied to me. We've given each other massages, albeit platonic ones. He is always ultra competitive with me, and sometimes he can even be overly aggressive. He is slightly bigger than me, and he seems determined to display that by pinning me into submission and tackling me to the ground.

Fast forward several months to our last week at school. He feigned frustration towards me and used that as a motive to climb on top of me and put me in a very uncomfortable position, with two other people witnessing it. I have a feeling he's been using these aggressive episodes as a way to get closer to me.

Our last night before heading home for the summer, we went out with all of our friends to explore the campus one final time. The two of us inadvertently were separated from the rest of the group, with me heading too far ahead of everyone and him ""watching my back"" as usual. We intended to regroup but ended up taking an hour long adventure through the woods on campus alone.

The thing is, neither of us is out yet. It feels like we're in a stalling pattern, each person waiting for the other to finally make a move. He has often talked about girls in a general sense and even proclaimed that he would find me a girlfriend, but has done absolutely nothing to back his statements IMO. I think he is trying to cover himself for now, and My focus has been focusing on building a strong friendship before anything else. Fortunately, I will probably see him next month, where I plan to come out to him to gauge his reaction and to our other mutual friends! Even if he isn't truly gay, I will be pleased with the friendship we have established this past year.

I moved to Korea to teach last year, and since I'm living here alone, I decided to explore a bit. I'd never had sex before, nor had any relationships with anyone so I thought now would be a good time to try, outside of judgment from my friends and family. I turned to using Jack'd, which I'd never use in my hometown because I do have some gay friends but I'm not out to anybody.

Anyways, I live in a rural-ish part of Korea (not anywhere near Seoul), so all the Jack'd users were native Koreans (I am not Korean). However, I did learn a little before coming here so I tried to talk to them. I had to work up the courage to meet people because first off: I'd never dated before, and secondly, there was a huge language barrier.

After some various""dates (usually just going to get a coffee), I gave it up for some time, deciding that I wasn't the type to go out for one-night stands--which a lot of these sexually repressed Korean men want--but recently I tried it again.

I prefer older guys--since I have no experience and was hoping for some guidance--but I ended up with someone younger and whose English is just really terrible. However, with my broken Korean and some body language, we've been able to hang out at each others' apartments for the past two months.

The first night was pretty liberating, as I'd never had such close contact with anyone--male or female--and we both gave and received oral.

However, as of late, the Korean guy has been asking to come over to my apartment or asking me to go over, and only helping me finish. He barely gets hard but I always do and it's been getting embarrassing. I'm not sure if I'm doing something wrong, or if I'm not his type, or maybe I'm just really bad at blowjobs?

I asked him if he wanted to try anal and we tried, with him bottoming, but he said it hurt and we stopped almost immediately. I suggested him topping another time and he went limp at the thought, saying he was nervous.

I'm naturally pretty self-conscious and this isn't helping it at all; normally I would be worried that he's lost interest in me or something, but it's always him who calls or texts me. He basically comes over, gives me a blowjob, and then leaves. He never wants me to reciprocate and he's usually soft throughout.

**TL;DR** Korean guy I can't really communicate well with only wants to give me blowjobs, doesn't seem to get any sexual gratification out of it for himself.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bear with me, the story is a bit strange and it may take some time to explain.&lt;/p&gt;

It just came pouring out.

I'm a 19 year old who was a virgin up until 4 days ago. I met a guy on OkCupid a while back and we had a date last month. It went decently, but after speaking a bit more via text in the following days, we lost touch for about 3 weeks. At that point, I sent him another text asking how everything was going, and we started talking again and decided he would come over and hang out. 

I picked him up around 7pm the next day, and we did the standard hanging-out stuff at first: played Xbox, watched a movie, etc. He's a bit of a stoner (I don't have much experience with marijuana), and he asked me if I wanted to smoke with him, and we did. It was enjoyable, and afterwards we went back inside and watched another movie, eventually leading to cuddling. After the movie, we both slept for a few hours, and woke back up in the middle of the night. 

We were spooning, me as big spoon, and he started grinding on me. That progressed to other things, and eventually we fucked, him being bottom. I wasn't very good, it being my first time, and I couldn't cum for some reason, probably nerves. I had no problem maintaining an erection, though. He seemed to enjoy it, though, and came in a few minutes.

After we finished, we cuddled more and sorta slept, and eventually got up around 7am. We were just hanging out naked for the rest of the day, and we messed around more and fucked two more times over the next few hours. I still couldn't cum. 

Eventually we ordered food, and when we got back, he wanted to smoke again. This time, I smoked way too much for a newbie, and got super fucking paranoid. I have a history of anxiety and panic attacks, and this was the worst I've ever felt. I thought I was dying, and combined with my highness I basically ruined the rest of the day. I think I freaked him out, I don't know, I can hardly remember anything. I do remember that when I was really out of it, he laid down next to me and initiated oral sex again, but I can only remember the beginning of it. I think I blacked out or something.

I told him straight out that I would not be able to drive him home until the crazy shit that was happening subsided, and he basically spent the next few hours on facebook while I laid down, staring at the ceiling and feeling horrible. He told me he wanted to go home by midnight, which furthered my anxiety because I worried I wouldn't be out of my panic attack by then. Overall, it was a really bad experience.

I felt better by midnight, though, so I drove him home carefully. He kissed me and told me to kik/text him, then got out of my car and went inside his house.

I sent him a message on kik when I got home, just saying that I was home safely, but the status hass been ""s"" ever since I sent it (If you're not aware, Kik is a messaging app that tells you when a message has been sent to the other person's device, read by them, etc. ""s"" means that it was sent to the Kik server but not to their device yet). I think this either means his iPod has either been off ever since then (4 days ago), possibly that he blocked me (not sure if it would say ""s"" in this case), or that the app hasn't been running in the background at all since then. 

Today, I texted him instead but haven't had a reply. I just say ""hi"", and then told him if he didn't wanna talk anymore that was ok, but at least end it on a good note. I don't plan on pursuing it any further if he doesn't respond, because I don't want to come off as a creep or stalker. I've seen him online on OkCupid twice in the past 4 days, most recently this morning, and he also uploaded a new picture, which leads me to believe he's not interested anymore. 

I liked him quite a bit. He's very cute and has a great body, and he's nice and fun to be around. He's not the most mature person (he's younger than me and still in that angsty teenager phase), but he was more experienced when it comes to relationships and sex and weed. 

Ever since I came down from that terrible high, I've been extremely anxious. I had to listen to a calming audiobook the day after just so I could drive to school without freaking the fuck out. Right now, I'm feeling depressed, anxious, regretful, and alone. 

I really just want some closure, for him to either tell me he wants to keep talking or that he never wants to see me again. Either way is fine, I just hate being in limbo. Even if he says he still likes me, I'll probably end it myself because I don't see him as someone I can really trust in the long run, and I don't ever want to feel like this again.

This was much longer than I expected, and I'm sorry for that, but even if nobody replies (or reads it), it felt good to get it out. 

I don't really know what to do to get rid of this feeling. My chest feels heavy and I'm not motivated to do anything, I've lost my appetite (yesterday all I ate was a bowl of ramen), and I can't fucking stop thinking about this. If anyone could share similar experiences or give me advice on what to do, I'd really appreciate it. Thanks.

Also, I think he stole a pair of my underwear, wtf?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wow, sorry this is so long. It just came pouring out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a 19 year old who was a virgin up until 4 days ago. I met a guy on OkCupid a while back and we had a date last month. It went decently, but after speaking a bit more via text in the following days, we lost touch for about 3 weeks. At that point, I sent him another text asking how everything was going, and we started talking again and decided he would come over and hang out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I picked him up around 7pm the next day, and we did the standard hanging-out stuff at first: played Xbox, watched a movie, etc. He&amp;#39;s a bit of a stoner (I don&amp;#39;t have much experience with marijuana), and he asked me if I wanted to smoke with him, and we did. It was enjoyable, and afterwards we went back inside and watched another movie, eventually leading to cuddling. After the movie, we both slept for a few hours, and woke back up in the middle of the night. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were spooning, me as big spoon, and he started grinding on me. That progressed to other things, and eventually we fucked, him being bottom. I wasn&amp;#39;t very good, it being my first time, and I couldn&amp;#39;t cum for some reason, probably nerves. I had no problem maintaining an erection, though. He seemed to enjoy it, though, and came in a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we finished, we cuddled more and sorta slept, and eventually got up around 7am. We were just hanging out naked for the rest of the day, and we messed around more and fucked two more times over the next few hours. I still couldn&amp;#39;t cum. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually we ordered food, and when we got back, he wanted to smoke again. This time, I smoked way too much for a newbie, and got super fucking paranoid. I have a history of anxiety and panic attacks, and this was the worst I&amp;#39;ve ever felt. I thought I was dying, and combined with my highness I basically ruined the rest of the day. I think I freaked him out, I don&amp;#39;t know, I can hardly remember anything. I do remember that when I was really out of it, he laid down next to me and initiated oral sex again, but I can only remember the beginning of it. I think I blacked out or something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told him straight out that I would not be able to drive him home until the crazy shit that was happening subsided, and he basically spent the next few hours on facebook while I laid down, staring at the ceiling and feeling horrible. He told me he wanted to go home by midnight, which furthered my anxiety because I worried I wouldn&amp;#39;t be out of my panic attack by then. Overall, it was a really bad experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt better by midnight, though, so I drove him home carefully. He kissed me and told me to kik/text him, then got out of my car and went inside his house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sent him a message on kik when I got home, just saying that I was home safely, but the status hass been &amp;quot;s&amp;quot; ever since I sent it (If you&amp;#39;re not aware, Kik is a messaging app that tells you when a message has been sent to the other person&amp;#39;s device, read by them, etc. &amp;quot;s&amp;quot; means that it was sent to the Kik server but not to their device yet). I think this either means his iPod has either been off ever since then (4 days ago), possibly that he blocked me (not sure if it would say &amp;quot;s&amp;quot; in this case), or that the app hasn&amp;#39;t been running in the background at all since then. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I texted him instead but haven&amp;#39;t had a reply. I just say &amp;quot;hi&amp;quot;, and then told him if he didn&amp;#39;t wanna talk anymore that was ok, but at least end it on a good note. I don&amp;#39;t plan on pursuing it any further if he doesn&amp;#39;t respond, because I don&amp;#39;t want to come off as a creep or stalker.

And other times I can get an erection but it's like my penis is numb and I have no sensation.
