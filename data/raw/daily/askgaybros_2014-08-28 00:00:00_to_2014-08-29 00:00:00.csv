I start driving and then one after the other I would pick up every guy I once dated or had a crush on... Every single one.

One of them tried to crash us... All of them ended up blaming me for things not working out, that I should just crash the car and die and everyone would be happy... The dream ended with me alone in the car and driving off a cliff.

Let me start by saying I'm a straight(ish) guy (28 years old) with a girlfriend. I. Love. Crushing. Vaginas. Feels awesome, its the primal urge that is so satisfying, and I'm madly in love with my girlfriend. Been dating her for about a year. Previous GF was 4 years. I'm pretty much a serial monogamist. So I'm going to give you a brief history in the making


Anyways, at the ripe age of 19 I watched gay porn for some reason. I'm pretty sure it started out by accident. Then over the course of a year it escalated to gay porn **exclusively**. I wasn't attracted to guys at all. Just the porn. Something about penis going into buttholes made me blow countless loads onto the hand-towels. My mom was really confused as to how they were piling up so quickly. That graduated to experimenting with my ass. I had an anal fixation and fantasized about getting penetrated and filled up with cum. So i tried putting hot dogs up there, which to be honest wasnt that great/satisfying. That actually kinda turned me off of it for a while. 


**I found the wonders of craigslist**.  
 I would get off on just reading the posts but not for long. I reached out to guys, and made a few posts but I could never pull the trigger when it came down to it. I was and am so terrified of someone finding out about this fixation. Until one fateful day I had a couple drinks and said fuck it. I waited till my girlfriend went to bed and then met up with this guy i had arranged a meet up with and i was so goddamn nervous. I brought i joint with me to calm the nerves. We talked for a bit and he asked me if i have ever kissed a guy, and i hadnt so he suggested that we start with that. It was awful. He was really forceful and I had no idea someone could put so much tongue in my mouth. I had to be like ""go easy on the tongue, dude"" and he obliged. But he was still teeth bumping forceful about it. It was really weird for me because I'm a big guy. 6'6"" and 225 lbs. He was a 5'8""ish mexican guy. After a bit of that, i got to touch another penis. I was really excited about it. It seemed really thick and had a pretty harsh left hook. I wanted nothign more to suck on it, so I did. He was forcing my head down on it (which i wasnt having any of) and told me i was doing a great job. I really liked it. Pretty soon i was on my back with my pants down at my ankes, and he was fingering my ass while blowing me. He actually gave a great BJ, and the fingers in the ass brought me to the edge quick and justly. He wanted to fuck me but we had no condoms so i said no (he was practically begging me). I never met up with him again. I was 20/21 or so


Fast forward a few years, Im on a business trip in montreal and I have another one of those urges. I have a guy come to my place. I was in no mood to talk or anything. We pretty much went straight to my bed and got naked. He was another awful kisser. A lot of sucking. I told him previously i wanted to bottom, but he was a bottom as well. He had a pretty small penis though. I couldnt keep it up. I tried to top him but i was just really not attracted to him at all. He was overweight, smelled a bit, and his ass smelled gross. He obliged me and fucked me. He was humping pretty hard, and i was new to the sensation and it was almost too much. He came in a matter or 2 minutes or so. It was really dissapointing encounter all together. Another failed attempt.
  
Present day- i went to a sex shop and bought a dildo. I was in the parking lot for like 20 minutes just building the confidence to go in and buy it. It was so nerve racking. But I did. It's like 8"" long and 5"" in girth and MAN it was tough to deal with at first. I got it home and couldnt wait to try it. For a couple months i use it a few times a month when my GF isnt over. I DREAM of being able to cum from prostate stimulation. I just want a guy to top me, and fuck me until I cum. I've got really close before with a dildo but it plateaus and I cant quite get it. This frustration has brought me to this point.


I just put an ad up on craigslist about wanting to have a secret relationship. I want to know what it's like to be WITH a guy. I want to cuddle with him, make out with him and be his woman basically. I want to tend to his sexual needs and have him fuck me over and over again. I just cant stop fantasizing about it. The guy I'm talking to I actually find somewhat attractive which is a first. It's really weird because I consider myself an alpha. THE alpha of my friends. And I love taking control with women. But i want the exact opposite with guys. So some questions for you:


* Does this make me gay? or just curious? What the hell am I?
* My girlfriend doesnt know about any of this. And i feel she cant ever know. I'd be too embarrassed. Anyone else in this spot?
* How would you guys tackle these feelings? Am I going about it the right way?


*Edit, also note that I get a lot of sex.  On average, 5-6 times a week.  And I still masturbate like twice+ a day.  My sex drive is pretty damn high, or at least my GF tells me.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys.

He's one of my best friends, and since we met we liked each other. He completely changed my world the moment we first talked. I did not knew he was gay at the time, much less that he liked me too. I found out he was gay the very same day I got a boyfriend, and the feelings I tried to shut down for liking a ""straight guy"" just overflowed. Broke up with said new boyfriend a few weeks later, and in a party that same weekend, we had **extremely** drunk sex, puking and all. Not pretty, so we decided it was just a funny story we now share. 

A few months passed, we went through a lot of things together, including the death of one of our best friends (we're med students, she got meningitis and I found her on her bed, some really depressing stuff  I find hard to write about). After these months I finally decided to tell him I loved him. Because I did and I still do. 

Basically he told me we had become like brothers, and that he used to feel things for me and ""things change"". Crap, I cried for 4 months.

During this time of really shitty depression I noticed (and some other friends mentioned this too, so I was not being paranoid) that he would always and only mention other romantic/sexual relationship with other guys when I was around. I felt like shit, and I know he noticed.

After a year or so of trying to get over him, I realized I just didn't had the power to do that. So if I can't do something about it, why get stressed right? If I get a partner, or he does, I the whole world ends, I can't stop loving him. Lifted a huge weight over my shoulders and I started being happy again. I don't think words can describe how I felt, hope you have a general idea (more so if you're not writing in your native language, sorry guys). 

I even started dating. My friend Ana told me he went to her for advice, because he was upset I started dating someone else. What the hell?! He told Ana he was not sure about how he felt for me. Is he afraid of losing our friendship if we date?

Lately he has been... very bitchy and mean to me. Ditched me on a club so he could fuck, made plans to watch a movie with me then bailed to go to a party (with friends we share, I did not get invited), and some other stuff like that. When I show even a little bit of resentment, he tells me I'm not being the best of friends. 

He makes me feel so bad sometimes, but most of the time we're inseparable.

I just need your opinion on my situation, i dnot know what to do

Lets start from the beginning

I was 16 years old when i met my boyfriend, at that time i got 25 euros of pocket money from my mom and i had spare money from my birthday... he lives 2 hours away fom me and i had to buy a supscription for the train (50 euros) to make every ride cost less 1 trip cost me 11 euros, my way back was 11 euros too what ment i had 3 spare euros from my pocket money... what i want to say with this that i could live from only 10 euro (a bit birthday money) a month when i dont count the train costs with it... my boyfrined had a job that moment and i didn't ask him to pay things for me EVER

Now we're 2 years together already but he has lost his job (8 months ago) and he's totaly broke... i have a job now but he asks me to pay like EVERYTHING for him... i get nothing for my birthday because he is broke... i have to pay his train and he costs me 6 euros a day what is 40 euros a week... why does he cost me 6 euros a day? he wants to get candy and chips and soda every day... i mean, i have the money to pay for all his stuff but i'm sick of doing it

Me and my frineds motivated him, sent him jobs he could apply too... but he didn't want any of the jobs because he thinks he deserves better or something... my friends often ask me to join thme with things but it makes everything 2 times as expensive because i have to pay for my boyfriend too... but the sad thing is... i want to do all this stuff with him because i want to make him and myslef happy but it costs a lot of money

Me and my friends tried to help him find a job but he rejected because he expects over-payed jobs to come and i dont know how to help him anymore

he spents more of my money than he will ever do with his

I just dont know anymore

So... what is your opinion on this?

You can ask me questions i will respond

&lt;p&gt;Me and my friends tried to help him find a job but he rejected because he expects over-payed jobs to come and i dont know how to help him anymore&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;he spents more of my money than he will ever do with his&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just dont know anymore&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So... what is your opinion on this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can ask me questions i will respond&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;

I am really, really close with my best friend.  We just graduated college.  He always is the social one and he pushes me to put myself out there.  He's so fucking attractive, like I get hard just being in the area close to him sometimes.

Anyway, he came out as gay which **shocked the hell** out of me!  I never pegged him for that.  I was about the third or fourth person he told (he drunkenly admitted it to our other friends and told me shortly after so I would be the first one to be in the loop).  Since then, he's been meeting/dating/banging guys.

The guys he gets are so much better looking than I am.  Some of them also seem cool.  I am very average and can't compete with some of these guys.  He Tindered with me once because I asked what kind of guy he liked.  He immediately ""swiped left"" to some really cute guys that I would have loved to get a chance to be with.  He swipes left for the dumbest reasons too (this person isn't white, this person has an earring, this person has a tattoo, this person is too hipster, and on and on).  He only swiped right on the hottest of the hottest guys, and he got like all the matches with them!  Every one he said yes to was a match basically!  

I can't compete with that.  I'm so average.  Girls didn't like me like they like him, and guys definitely won't like me like they like him.  I'm so nervous that he's not going to even consider dating me at all.  I used to dream that he'd be gay too, but I feel worse now.  At least if he was straight, it could never happen between us because of something out of my control.  Now, it's never going to happen solely because I'm not good enough for him.

  I have come out only to a handful of close friends who have been supportive, but I feel I need to progress in telling my family and maybe some coworkers if the convo comes up. 

  It has been about 5 years now (lost track) since I have stopped dating girls and accepted my feelings to guys. Lately though I have been feeling pretty depressed and isolated from family, having difficulties sleeping and stuff like that. I know I need to do something about it and feel it's my secret that is causing me issues in my day to day. 

  I told my mom a few years back, and recently talked to her again about how it's really getting to me that I can't be open when I go home and she agrees and feels bad for me that I feel I can't bring my boyfriend to family events etc and agrees I should tell more family. She admits she doesn't know what all the extended family will think but encourages me not to care. 

  I know some of my discourage comes from my high school and early 20s days which I won't get into.

  So what I am currently trying to figure out, my mom knows, but my dad and my siblings do not although I am pretty certain my sister suspects. I live about an hour from all my family and work a stupid 3-11pm schedule every week and am mostly with my boyfriend on weekends. So getting back home can be difficult at times, usually once a month if I am lucky which tends to fall on birthdays or holidays (which my dad's birthday is coming up at the end of the month)

  I had a convo with one of my gay friends trying to think of how to approach this, but he seems to think that coming out on a family holiday or somebody's birthday isn't the best idea. One idea I was toying with so I don't chicken out again was to write a letter and slip it in my dad's birthday card, it'll be done, I can express how I feel on paper and not stumble my thoughts trying to talk to him.

I have a bit of an angsty dilemma and I was looking for some advice.

Me and this guy have been messaging each other on Scruff for a couple weeks now. We met up and have been on two dates so far, and both times have been great. However on the last date he says that he’s not really wanting to date to get into a heteronormative relationship and while he likes to date, he also likes his alone time. He also said that a close confidant is pressuring him to try getting into a relationship with someone (someone in general, not one specific guy), but he is resistant.  This bothered me because I am interested in pursuing a relationship down the line (not right now, it’s too early). 

What I’m wondering: is it too early or too pushy to ask him to clarify what he said? I would like to keep seeing this guy, but I already like him and I'm worried about developing more feelings for him. I guess I don’t want to get heartbroken down the line and would like some advance warning so I can manage my expectations better. He also lives about 3 hours away, which makes seeing him a bit more difficult and costly.

To make matters worse I go to the second most conservative college in America, surrounded by the heterosexual couples. 
My question is whether or not I should tell the only other kid on campus who knows I'm gay about my crush. We're both friends with him and this would give me someone to talk to when things get rough.

I have no gay friends so this has included grindr. Ended up talking to someone because he was also a grad of my college. He was just passing through, but took time out to meet up- no not for sex but to meet each other, seriously. We spent about three hours together before he had to continue the drive home. Turns out we even had the same major. 

I had a great time, and even though he's not typically in my city was so glad to find someone like that, if only as a friend. When we parted he said keep in touch. He also said to tell him when I got home safely. 

The next day when I checked in he said spending time with family. I said thanks I really enjoyed it, hope we can talk again like that sometime. No response, so I let it be and then a day or two later he went on vacation so I didn't say anything. The next week (two days ago) he was back, I told him about my experience that weekend going to gay bars, he suggested some places to try. I said thanks and asked a question about him, no response. Next day (yesterday) I passed along my full name because he had given his but I hadn't mine. No response. 

I was afraid from the beginning that keep in touch could just be a nicety and didn't mean it, but how do I know? (This is not my first time in these situations where I seem to be told one thing but then meaning another, can anything be taken as truth anymore?) I know this shouldn't mean that much to me but right now in a pretty sad spot with no job, no social life, and no confidence. Meeting someone like that was just what I needed, a bright spot in a bleak time. Which of course is my responsibility and the feelings I place in something so minor. I'd be crushed if turns out he doesn't want to talk again, but would rather know the truth than keep hopes up. As you can see not much to go on, but can't help continuously thinking the worst. The day we met we had talked for hours before hand. What to do?

**tl;dr**- Met someone nice as friends, was told to stay in touch but when I haven written I don't get a response. Does the silence mean take a hint, and the stay in touch wasn't serious?
