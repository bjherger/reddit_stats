do you have any recommendations on style or brand of underwear for extra thick thighs?

I have been working out and my thighs got bigger to the point that they begin to rub against each other.

that's when I changed from briefs to boxer briefs. That was 6 months ago. Recently, my thighs have even gone bigger (and maybe fatter?) to the point that boxer briefs behave like briefs...

Boxers don't solve the rubbing issue either and are too loose...

Any advice?

Fast forward to last week: I got turbo drunk one night and drunkenly placed an add on craigslist (m+m) with one of my secondary emails. This one guy with a nice one answers and I decide after all the dreaming and imagining; I'm actually gonna do it.

The Deed: I went to his apartment and blew him for a bit, maybe 5 minutes, and halfway through kinda regretted it. It was actually a really nice dick, but it didn't feel right. I stopped and told him that I'd had enough and had to leave. He said it was all good and then asked if it was my first time, I said yeah and he said it was really good; he would have came soon!

I've only ever had sex with girls and consider myself straight, but what do you guys make of this? I know sexuality isn't black &amp; white, but I feel like such an idiot....

**UPDATE**

Really sorry I didn't tell you guys what happened sooner.

In the days afterwards I felt pretty bad for just leaving him like that. About 2 weeks ago I was in his area and pretty drunk and texted him if I could make it up to him. He said it was birthday so he was out for dinner, but I could come around midnight.

At his apartment we drank some beers and smoked a little weed, before we headed to his bedroom. I went down on him until he was hard and then told him he could fuck me if he wanted to, since it was his birthday after all ;). He got really excited and I told him it was my first time doing anal so I was a bit nervous. He promised he would be gentle, and it actually felt really good!

I know it's not love (probably stems from boredom and a big ego), but the feeling i keep getting is really becoming a problem.

It's also not like I can just go out and find a bf (family doesn't know i'm gay, i don't know anyone who is gay, etc.) I think we all get that feeling that we won't find someone and it's really depressing.
