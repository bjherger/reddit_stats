Problem is I got some kind of male yeast infection and while it's not glaringly obvious or hard to look at, it's still noticeable and it's kinda had me in the dumps for a good while. I do hope to get rid of it but from what I've seen online it's a lot of work dieting and pretty much no sex/masturbating/alcohol/caffeine/sugar for up to two months and sometimes longer. 

Being in uni and living at home puts me in a position where it's near impossible to go on that kind of strict diet to clear it so I feel like I kinda just have to accept it for the time being at least. I really do want to have sex with guys and enjoy myself but I'm so scared of passing it on to someone else (like an STD) or that they think I have an STD or anything. It also puts off relationships I think since it's unfair to say that I probably shouldn't have sex with you for an indefinite period of time since it means a lot to a lot of people. I could still use a condom for anal and things but I feel like exposing anyone to this so I can experience things is being selfish. I'm really torn because I know people can be in sexual relationships where one is HIV+ and the other isn't. Not sure if it's exactly comparable to that though.

Am I getting really worried over a small thing and should just go for it provided the other guy's aware and comfortable with it? Or should I wait? Since it's so hard to get rid of, sometimes it feels like abstaining from sex is the only thing to do and I won't ever be able to have guilt-free sex?

I just need to get shit off my chest I've had a really bad week and was wondering if you guys could let me know about some stuff. So I met this guy on grindr, my age &amp; my type. We hit it off pretty good and have heaps in common. We hung out in the city on Wednesday and walked around just the two of us for 3 hours, we hugged and all that stuff and just talked about whatever... My issue comes straight after this has all happened. Just so you guys are aware I suffer from very very bad social anxiety to the point where I have to take time off work due to panic attacks + breakdowns and recently got over depression issues as well. I was on facebook talking to him and he said he was keen to hang out again next week. I asked him if he wanted to make it a date instead of just hanging out... He said he no and that he already likes someone else, but he still wants to hang out. He also said that if he didn't like this other person that we had a chance of dating. To quote him when I asked if they were dating he said ""nope not yet. but i dont know. it may happen sometime soon im not sure."" 


**TL;DR - Met this guy who is amazing, turns out he doesn't want to date me because he likes someone else but isn't dating them yet and says if he didn't like them he would date me**


I guess my question is, should I keep trying to go out with him? I do really like him and this whole thing has kind of torn me up inside.. I don't really want to give up but I have never been in this situation before. Do you guys have any advice for me or could recommend me something to do about it? I have no other gay friends that I can talk about this stuff with so yeah... Please help me out here I am so lost and alone :/

He's 10 years older than me (31, I'm 21) and said he doesn't normally go under 26 but I was an exception because he felt I was mature enough and he liked how I could hold a conversation. We talked about doing something again (his house is free during the day when his housemates are working so he was asking if I was free during the day to which I said yes) and then he wanted my number. After he left me home he texted how it was nice to meet me and how genuine I was. What I liked about this hook up was that we talked a lot before we actually did stuff and even after he came he pulled me close and wrapped his arm around me and we just sat, talking shit, listening to the radio. I do think if he wasn't that interested he would have took me home straight away..(he also said how my glasses suited me and he liked how I was a good kisser). 

When he did leave me off he said about how he goes off Grindr for a few weeks at a time and how he's not that big of texter which didn't bother me or raise any red flags at all (even though we don't want to admit it, we know in our gut when someone is being flaky and I didn't get bad feelings from him). 

What I'm afraid of doing is freaking him out because we chatted on Monday for a bit then briefly chatted on Tuesday and Wednesday. I wasn't going to message him yesterday but did because I found out the spot we went to was a well known dogging spot which was something we were chatting about, as we weren't sure. He just wrote back 'Oops! Lol' and when I joked how at least we wouldn't have been judged he just wrote back 'Lol'. I tried to continue the convo asking him about his day (which I shouldn't have) but he never replied. Even now it says I sent the message 16 hours ago and he was online 15 hours ago (he usually comes online at about 8/9 at night). We both agreed we weren't looking anything serious so I'm afraid with me messaging him the past few days I might be freaking him out. 

Should I just leave it a few days and if he doesn't reply maybe actually text him and say about coffee or something Thanks, cause I do know I'm probably overthinking atm.

Hey, I met a guy off OkCupid yesterday. I'm pretty inexperienced with this sort of thing. I've done it once before (different person) and it didn't lead anywhere.

I really like this guy, but I really got the impression that he was out of my league. (At least, a lot more experienced than me.)

Anyway, about an hour in, the conversation turns to sex. Now, I've always understood that talking about past sexual experiences or relationships during a first date is sort of a faux pas. This doesn't stop him, and he goes into great detail about his sex life. His first time, how many times, his attitude toward one-night stands (seemingly pretty liberal), good kissers vs bad kissers, etc...

Just to be clear, he didn't seem to be boasting or anything, it was all part of natural conversation and I didn't take it negatively. However I couldn't help but think that he wouldn't be telling me any of this if he intended to go any further with me, that maybe he'd have been a little more coy. I certainly couldn't see myself discussing the merits of tongue versus no tongue with someone I intended to kiss.

Does this sound like an obvious red flag to anyone? Am I being extremely overcritical and neurotic?

It started off with a curiosity about guys.  I rationalized it as ""oh, I'm just comparing bodies with them, it's no big deal.  I don't *like* them.  I like girls.""  Then I fell in love with my best friend, and I rationalized it as ""Oh, I don't *love* him, I just have never been this close with a friend before.""  And I hooked up with girls the whole time, never getting anything out of it.  ""I'm just really picky, that's all.  I'll be fine once I find a hotter girl, right?  Then I'll be really into it.""

Reading /r/gaybros and this sub and watching clips, documentaries, movies, etc. made me realize one thing: I'm completely full of shit.  I fucking like dudes.  The couple of times I made out/had sex with guys, I was way more into it than any time I've ever been with a girl.  I need to accept that I'm gay.

I think about it constantly now.  I see guys walk by and feel disgusting that I'm turned on.  Then I'll see a girl and guy walking by and think, ""Oh, why can't I just be like them?""  Everything would be nice and easy.

I want kids.  I want a family.  I don't want the freedom to travel or explore or any of that shit.  I'm a conservative guy.  I want to go to work, come home to the wife and kids with a hot dinner on the table, and sit with my family.  I guess you can still have that with a guy, but is it the same?  I can't imagine being the ""gay dads"" at my kids' events.  I can't imagine going out and dancing with another guy.  I can't even imagine our wedding.  I'm uncomfortable thinking about all of my family and friends watching me and another dude do all that romantic stuff together.

It hit me today.  I literally had a breakdown in my office.  I **never** cry, but I went to the bathroom and fucking sobbed.  I hate being like this.  I know that's probably offensive to a lot of you, but I hate it.  I had everything going for me.  I was always the one who could do no wrong.  My entire life feels like it's shattering around me.  

Every day I waver between ""I NEED to come out"" and ""I'm going to live a lie.""  I almost wish I didn't start being honest with myself, but I had blissful ignorance.  Now, it's just a mess.  I don't know what to do.  I don't know how to move forward.  I feel so much pressure, because my whole life, my biggest focus was to always appear like nothing was wrong and not show any weakness.  I don't know how long I can keep fooling myself and everyone around me, because I feel broken as fuck right now.

Hope you are all having a great day. I'm hoping to bounce my thoughts off of some of you. Any advice is much appreciated, thank you in advance. I'm very happy to have found such a great, supportive community.

Met this amazing guy about 3 years ago who I'm very compatible with, but it's always been the wrong time. It's still the wrong time as he's getting over his ex and I've got some personal work to do, but I have a very strong feeling that we could be something great in about 6 months. We've gotten much closer as friends as of late and I've almost crossed the friendship line a couple times with him, but stopped. I want so desperately to tell him how I feel, but think it would taint both his and my own progress and ruin any future I could have with him, a flower blooming too soon. As his friend, I am trying to be supportive of him going out and dating other guys which I view as a necessary part of getting over an ex, but I find it very frustrating. This guy is marriage material and I want to make sure I do it right this time around. He needs no knight in shining armor to rescue him and I feel acting as one would be a disservice to him anyways, but watching from the sidelines is so difficult.

Am I on the right track? Do you think I should be doing something different? Perhaps you've got something to add? I would very much appreciate your input.

Edit: Okay, so I've decided to just tell him how I feel. It doesn't have to result in anything, but you guys are right. Wish me luck!

I'm not judgmental, just genuinely curious what bonds someone's attraction to a human in their later years instead of a peer or someone at their physical prime. 

An important note is that neither of these guys were interested in a sugar daddy situation. They both made their own money and didn't want to be taken care of. When I asked one about his attraction toward guys in this age range, he just talked about gray hair being hot, but didn't really speculate about where his specific tastes may have evolved or come from.

Maybe no one will have 'advice,' per se, but commiseration helps, too. (Maybe you'll feel better about your own life after reading this... haha. Hey, if it helps.)

My life has spiraled downwards the past year or so, and every time I think I steady myself, the floor drops out from under me. The most recent thing was that I got turned down for (yet) another job yesterday - one I worked my ass off for (did projects with the hiring manager, etc). I might have another potential job lined up, at half the pay I'm making now, but I don't know for sure. I have applied to 173 over the last year.

The reason I would take the low-paying, low-title job (if it's offered) is because I don't know how much longer I can stay where I am. I hate my job - it's pointless, demeaning, boring, etc. But I can sort of handle that, since I get paid pretty well (and need the money, since I have $70,000 in outstanding student loans to pay off). The bigger downside is that this is where my ex-boyfriend works. In a better job, that I helped him get. He dumped me a year ago, I'm still not over it, and to add to the pain he has been in a new relationship for the past 3-4 months. He made it even worse a few weeks ago when he bragged to me how much better his new BF is than I was, how great the sex is, how happy they are... yeah, my friends say he's a shithead, and that's clearly an asshole move, but that doesn't actually make any of this easier to deal with. It *should* logically help me get over him, but it hasn't.

My therapist set me up with a psychiatrist, because she thinks I need to be medicated. Depression, or obsessive disorder, or who knows what. I have been dating, but not much luck. I end up looking up my ex's Instagram, torturing myself with curiosity.

I used to be a really happy, put-together guy. I had friends, I had a life, I wasn't depressed. Then I went to grad school to improve my career, and instead it stalled. I fell in love and tried to build a relationship (and someday a home and family) and I got my heart broken. I stayed at this job to attempt to maintain my finances, and I just get this painful reminder - every single day, multiple times - of that breakup. I'm in debt, I'm lonely, and I don't know what to do. Maybe the medicine will help, but is that what this takes?

Comparing myself to others is a terrible idea - I get that - but I can't control it. I see my ex and his great life, his higher income, his job that he loves, his boyfriend that he loves, all his new friends... --it's fucking depressing. It's easy to overhear him talking about little things - TV shows he watches with his BF, trips to the beach, nothing that doesn't come up in normal chitchat - and those little things are what I always valued. Cooking together, going for walks. Just small things.

I try to look to small things now, since none of the big things are going my way. And it helps, a little. The nonprofit org I volunteer with, the websites I try to learn to code, basketball games, stuff like that. Sometimes those remind me of my ex, so I just spend a night in watching Family Guy and drinking beer. Or jack off and go to bed. The window of stuff that I can hold onto gets smaller and smaller. My options get narrower and narrower. I worry that someday I'll only have one left.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;It really helps to talk these things out.

I see my ex and his great life, his higher income, his job that he loves, his boyfriend that he loves, all his new friends... --it&amp;#39;s fucking depressing. It&amp;#39;s easy to overhear him talking about little things - TV shows he watches with his BF, trips to the beach, nothing that doesn&amp;#39;t come up in normal chitchat - and those little things are what I always valued. Cooking together, going for walks. Just small things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try to look to small things now, since none of the big things are going my way. And it helps, a little. The nonprofit org I volunteer with, the websites I try to learn to code, basketball games, stuff like that. Sometimes those remind me of my ex, so I just spend a night in watching Family Guy and drinking beer. Or jack off and go to bed. The window of stuff that I can hold onto gets smaller and smaller. My options get narrower and narrower. I worry that someday I&amp;#39;ll only have one left.&lt;/p&gt;
