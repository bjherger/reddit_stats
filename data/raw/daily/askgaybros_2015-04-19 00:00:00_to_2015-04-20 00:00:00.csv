At first I thought he was really cute, so I approached him, we started talking, and it turned out he was straight. That's fine, no biggie, I can always use more friends, right?  Well, we started hanging out along with another one of his friends quite frequently.  The thing about this friend is that initially when I started talking to him he seemed like a really nice guy and someone I'd want to know. This quickly eroded to reveal who he really is.  Let's just say he has no filter and has a lot of hatred. Makes you wonder why I'd hang out with someone like this. But he liked having me around to hang out with them and I had nothing better to do so I usually did.

Fast forward to several months later, and we've gotten closer...ish.  Before I would hear from him only when he wanted to hang out, but now it's daily thing texting back and forth that goes on throughout the whole day, and considers me part of his close circle of friends.  We talk about all sorts of things, including personal issues he's dealing with because he feels like I get him. Problem is despite my sincerest efforts I developed feelings for him. And it always seems that I fall for the guys that either aren't a possibility or someone who is completely opposite my own personality.

He knows I like him. And he understands that it can be a struggle much in same sense that when he really likes a girl who won't give him the time of day.  

He and his friend moved out of town and he frequently insists that I go visit them. And I have, but the last time I went, when I left, it hit me pretty hard how much I really like this guy.  Over the next few days he noticed that my messages were few and far between. He knew something was up. Eventually I told him that in truth, I was down. Having feelings for him, issues with family, my job, and other personal things. I felt like telling him how I felt really helped. He took it all very well, and sympathized. It felt great knowing I could tell him out loud and that he would be okay with it.  It was great knowing I could open up to him as he has with me.  Or so I thought.

He's been down a lot lately over some issues of his own, so he really wanted me to come pay them a visit. So I did.  The first night I was in town he seemed really happy, and we went out to a bar with 2 of our other friends.  One of these other friends and I have an unusual habit of being at each other's throats constantly, throwing out insults and such. I pushed him to a point where he pointed out me having the hots for our friend, and made a joke that referred to me being in the friend zone with him.  I was prepared to let it go because I can be transparent, especially when it comes to him, but I wasn't prepared for the friend to admit that  he had spoken up about what we had discussed.

I was really humiliated the rest of the night and it kept coming up. I wanted to leave, but I wasn't driving. So instead I did the next best thing: buried myself in alcohol and pretend nothing was wrong. By the time we left (in which the 4th friend puked all over the bar and out the window of the car on the way home) I sobered up and it hit me again.  I had planned on staying with them that night, but after that humiliation, I opted to get a room. I didn't feel comfortable in their apartment.  Thing is he when I told him why I left, he wasn't even apologetic over the fact that he admitted to telling them everything. Which begged the question if he told them this, what else has he told them that I thought we discussed in private (nothing bad, mostly family and friends, emotions, etc.).  Well when I asked he said that everything we discuss is public discussion amongst our group. 

He wasn't sorry about the humiliation he put me through because he didn't see it being a big deal. It really was for me, because it took a lot of courage for me to forward with him, and for him to just share it like a funny story took its toll on me.  Even when I tried explaining this all to him and how I felt, I was getting texts from his roommate telling me to 'suck it up'.

I was really upset over the whole thing. And while we've made peace at the moment, I'm still upset. Do I have the right to be upset though because I come off as transparent? Despite his shitty attitude towards everything, he really is a great guy, and he knows I think the world of him. But I feel as if there's a lost of trust there, especially since he confided so much in me. Sure I could out him on a lot of things, but I'm a bigger person than that. So idk.

I'm not entirely sure where to begin with this. I am 21, soon to be 22, overweight, and a virgin. I feel like I have zero confidence in the dating world. 

When I was in high school, I thought I was bi, I'm still not completely sure, I just know I have interest in guys 100 times more often than I'm even remotely interested in a girl. I NEVER had a problem getting a girlfriend in high school, although back then, in 2008-2012, my town was very unaccepting of LGBT people so most people stayed in the closet and I rarely tried to get a boyfriend. 

I recently got out of an online relationship of almost a year with an older man. We were perfect for each other in a lot of ways, but it was impossible for either of us to relocate due to finances, and in the end we decided it couldn't work out. Other than having skype sex with him, I'm completely a virgin, and I have severe confidence issues stemming from social anxiety and bipolar. I tend to get embarrassed around others because I worry I won't be able to control my outbursts/temper/panic attacks, so I've become sort of withdrawn and don't go out much. I've been trying to get involved in the dating scene, but most people seem to look right past me because I don't fit into the stereotypical model of male beauty. When I do get a date, which is rare, I feel incredibly awkward and tongue tied. Does anybody have any advice for actually making life as a gay man WORK for someone whose shy, slightly crazy, and living in a small town with very few LGBT resources? (We literally have the small hole in the wall gay bar, and that's about it.)

Him and his BF invited me to dinner at a nice restaurant tonight and tomorrow we're going to a local 4/20 festival together (I'm bringing a date as well).

Both of them still have some minor disturbance charges and dumb shit like disorderly conduct, but I guess that's neither here nor there.

So, I come home yesterday night a bit drunk and decide to check Grindr before falling asleep. One of the people in the list is this college kid that appeared quite recently but had a horrible confusing pic. But now he has a brand new pic and that’s super adorable. 


Don’t really know what I was thinking about, but I send him a message just to tell that the pic is very cute. He actually answers me and starts talking about him. That he doesn’t have friends, that he never kissed a guy, that he is very shy, that college guys are mean and they tell him that no one wants a fatty. Discussion goes on and eventually we decide to meet later today to play videogames.


This morning I’m definitely more sober and I started thinking about what happened. First, he gave a total stranger who contacted him at 2am a lot of personal information. I know his real name based on the Facebook profile, he told me exactly where he lives, what he studies, etc…  Second, he took and sent me a quite sexual pic after I asked (begged) for it (OMG, I’m a perv) even if he was not really comfortable with it and I sent him just an innocuous one. I know that it’s Grindr, but still… Last but not least, he agreed to go the house of that random guy the next day without meeting him first in public.  


Now I’m wondering if I should tell him something when he will come later today. Like suggest him to be more careful with the information/pics he gives to strangers and when agreeing to go to the house of random guys. I feel I should be a sort of old brother…

Long Story short... Guy leads me on for an entire year. I thought he cared for me. He turned mean on meth, suggested I do meth, and I've been on a daily self destructive tweak fest for 2 years since two days ago. Coming into my sobriety I've realized all of this and also that I've been suppressing the good emotions with the bad, so it's nice to not feel like a drone for once. What made me stop was that I've been late for work too many times because I'd sleep right thru my alarms from sheer exhaustion. Fun stuff

He turned mean on meth, suggested I do meth, and I&amp;#39;ve been on a daily self destructive tweak fest for 2 years since two days ago. Coming into my sobriety I&amp;#39;ve realized all of this and also that I&amp;#39;ve been suppressing the good emotions with the bad, so it&amp;#39;s nice to not feel like a drone for once. What made me stop was that I&amp;#39;ve been late for work too many times because I&amp;#39;d sleep right thru my alarms from sheer exhaustion. Fun stuff
Next I guess I&amp;#39;ll try asking this new guy out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this post is not really a question but if u have any related question for a gay ex addict I&amp;#39;m willing to AMA&lt;/p&gt;

An old friend added me via Xbox Live and I added him. I was extremely excited to see that he added me. I never had the chance to play any games with him or chat via Live after he added me because I don't have internet (I play games when I'm at a friends house). Back when I had internet (years ago) we would play games like COD and Halo and we would make each other laugh. I moved, didn't have Live or internet for a little while and saw he removed me. I was heartbroken a little, but I accepted it and moved on (I don't have many friends).

I was an idiot and stalked his Instagram and took a screenshot of a photo. I think he saw somehow and then he deleted a ton of photos (I don't know for sure, but I'm certain this is the case). I sent his a message via Live and said I'm sorry I couldn't play/hang out with him on Live cause I don't have internet and avoided the Instagram situation. I haven't told him I'm gay because I don't know how he would react, and I really want him as a friend. 

Almost a year or so later with no message back from him, I deleted him from my friends list on Live(He never deleted or blocked me on any social media after the incident). I regret it deeply now. 

How do I go about apologizing and letting him know I appreciate his friendship?

I have been facing a lot of life-changing events and decisions lately...and it is beginning to feel like it is a permanent fixture in my life.

4 years ago (I cannot believe I am saying it's been 4 years now). I broke up with my partner of 6 years. We ended on good terms as we both felt it wasn't going anywhere. I took action as I felt I was hurting him more by staying than leaving...one day he told me he is 'watching his life go by' and I just couldn't do that to him.

I did a lot of volunteering to get over the whole thing and it was truly one of the happiest moments of my life. Mind you, my life with my ex was great - true we had our ups and downs, but in all honesty, we still have a great friendship. We just understood each other intuitively. 

After 3 months, I met another person. We ended up together in a toxic, tumultuous relationship that was on and off for close to 3 years. I ended it for good by moving to another country. And even after doing that my ex had tried to get back with me, btw.

Anyway, 3 months of being single and I meet who is now my husband. This was a year ago, and we rushed and filed for the K-1 fiance visa. He lost his job right after we filed for the application. So I was the sole bread winner. The past year has been extremely tough but it was an eye-opener (all my mistakes and my previous experiences were) but this last experience was too real. I dealt with issues that I wasn't prepared for and I was in charge of practically everything: paperwork, full-time demanding job, securing finances, doing the day-to-day errands, finding flights, furniture, accommodation, etc. it goes on.

Lately, things are beginning to calm down and the dust is beginning to settle. I found work, we made progress in paperwork (though SO and I have had a lot of relationship issues that we have not sorted out yet) and things are getting better, slowly. I also must add that I have an opportunity to work on a startup side project with two people.

But I cannot help but shake off the feeling that so much has happened in the past three years. I'm a driven, sociable guy who loves entertaining, working and accomplishing things, reading, hanging out with friends, going to concerts and galleries and traveling as well...
I haven't done much of these things - I can't help but feel I could do more, and want to do more.

I am beginning to feel burnt out and I am scared. I feel that I am growing on so many levels, which is great, but I also feel incredibly lonely. I only have two friends and my family who live an hour away. It could be worse, yes, so I'm grateful for that.

But I just feel weird. I feel like I am having a different perspective on things. I feel my views and values are changing, that I am trying to adapt. I feel a bit uneasy. I feel a bit lonely. But I also feel very much alive. 

What's sad is that my SO and I are really losing touch. I am beginning to question monogamy itself (and this might be the underlying issue with myself here). And I feel that I just want to be single and alone.

Yet at the same time, I want to make a connection. I want to feel a connection with someone. I want to have friends. I want to hang out with different people. I want to do more things. I feel like the world is my oyster, but feel a bit held back...And I don't know why.

I'm 24 and I have no idea what to do with my life. I recently dropped out of grad school and I'm now working at a dead end office job that I am completely overqualified for. I don't know what I'm passionate about at all. I've tried intro courses in a billion subjects in undergrad and I cant get anything to stick. I've done like a billion personality tests and they havent helped. 

I've considered becoming a teacher...realized I dont care enough about the wellbeing of others. Ive considered going into IT or some sort of programming...tried to teach myself coding and it bored the hell out of me. The list goes on and on. 

Meanwhile, I still feel like such a failure for dropping out of grad school even though it was one of the loneliest, most miserable experiences of my life. I just wasnt passionate about the field but academics was the only thing I really had going on for me. 

I have like 2 ""friends"" from HS who like hang out with me like once a year and no love life. During weekdays, work numbs my mind but during the weekends, my depression hits me hard because it reminds me that I have no social life. The closest thing I've had to a boyfriend is a guy who booty calls me at like 2AM sometimes...and I dont even really find him that attractive. Its just like I feel if I decline, I dont know when's the next time I'll have sex. 

Im just very tired of life in general. No matter how hard I try, as superficial as it sounds, I'll never be that like that bougie gay with like ten pack abs and 5 masters degrees and a penthouse in NYC and a supermodel boyfriend and a fabulous life. Its just like...in life there are haves and have-nots. I was just not a winner in the genetic lottery. 

I've tried a therapist and to be quite honest, I hated it because I hate talking about my feelings. I dont like feeling emotionally vulnerable (unless its anonymously through reddit...heh). My parents are immigrants so I grew up in a very emotionless household...no hugs or ""I love you""'s or ""I miss you""'s. I just feel very stunted socially. I have plenty of acquaintances but I can never make any sort of lasting connection with anyone. I never grew out of my middle school awkward phase. I'm just so fucked up mentally at this point. To give you an idea of how socially fucked up I am...you know how during graduations every is like hugging and taking pictures with friends and family? Every single graduation for me (middle school, high school, college) has been spent alone...by myself. Taking my diploma and going home.

Everyone is out dancing with girls/girlfriends and I just kinda feel in the way, like something is expected of me and I can't do it.

It is then that I learn that so many guys out there only ever ""top"" or at least only ever bottom if they're in a serious relationship (I always get asked the top/bottom question on grindr).

Also, with what appears to be such a significant percentage of men only being prepared to top, what happens when you hook up with another top-only guy? Do you just awkwardly call it a night and go your separate ways? Goddammit I just don't know how it works!

I was kind of quiet and withdrawn because I've obviously been thinking a lot about this. My mom noticed that I was just moping around and pretending to do stuff on my ipad. She asked if I was OK. I told her that I really needed to tell her something. She sat down beside me on the couch and I just simply said ""I'm gay."" She looked so relieved and hugged me and started saying how proud she was that I told her, and how brave it was of me to do it, and how proud my dad would have been (he died when I was three), and how proud my uncle will be (the gay doctor), and I just started crying my eyes out on her shoulder. She then said that she had figured it out for some time, but that it needed to be my decision when to tell her. I sat back and asked her how she knew. She said that moms have an intuition, then she paused a bit and added ""And sound carries in this house."" I just sat there for a few seconds, not wanting to believe what I just heard, when she sprung the ultimate question and asked if my Caleb is my bf. She added ""It's OK if he is, but please tell me that he wears a condom."" I thought about retreating back into denial, but it was too late. She knew I was gay, knew that I had a boyfriend, knew I was having sex, had obviously HEARD me having sex (ugh! - that's going to take a while for me to recover from), and knew that I was a bottom (apparently because she heard me saying shit while I was being fucked). I told her yes, he wears a condom, and then started crying again and blubbering ""I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry!"" She asked why I was apologizing. I told her I was so sorry for hiding that I'm gay, and sorry for hiding my relationship. She started to laugh briefly, then caught herself, and then said softly ""You were hiding in plain sight. And that's OK."" We hugged and cried some more. She told me how proud she was that I was able to love and be loved by someone, and how much she likes Caleb, and what a cute couple we make.

My partner and I have been together for three years and we're on our way to tying the knot. He's more into monogamy than I am and I'm okay with that. He's cool with me texting and swapping pics on grindr in sort of a ""don't ask don't tell"" sort of way.

Anyway, I've been texting with a few guys, and we've been pretty explicit in talking about dom/sub, piss, and just getting mildly/moderately freaky. My partner and I usually keep it pretty vanilla or ""romantic"" when it comes to sex, and honestly I almost think it would be weird if we brought more kink into the bedroom. Maybe I've got some issues in bringing such disparate power dynamics into the context of an otherwise equal relationship.

Anyway, I guess I was wondering if anyone else had sexual fantasies in an otherwise fulfilling relationship, but felt limited in their ability to explore them not because their partner was against it, but because they weren't interested in carrying out their fantasies in the context of their relationship? We're there any arrangements or conversations or compromises that were helpful in this situation?

This makes it sound like my partner and I have some terrible confining relationship, but I assure you, that is not the case. I just want to get it on with someone I have less of a history with, I guess.

He is bi, and I'm still not entirely sure of my sexuality, I just knew that I wanted to date him. Long story short, I told him a couple of times I was into him, only to be turned down, then months down the line he invites me to bring my computer and have a LAN with him, we end up getting drunk, fool around, and he admits that he had feelings for me for a few weeks leading up to that (the last time I told him I was still into him was months before).  

We were both unemployed when that happened, but got jobs right after. Both as software developers, both very excited to share this new time in our lives. This was all back in last November.  

Well, in January, he started to get really busy, as software developers do. We also both started a new diet, and it had some ill effects. I was mostly trying it because he was, but he had done it before. 

In the middle of January he flips out at me. I'm trying to leave him too many messages, I'm bothering, I'm smothering him. So I say I'll leave him alone for a while.  

In February, right before Valentine's day, I sent him a message over Skype telling him to call me, since it had been a while since we talked. He calls me, assuming it's an emergency. It isn't, and he just sort of ends the call. The next night he chews me out for being selfish.  

Quick aside: we were friends for a while before we started dating. We went out to dinner almost every Friday, then hung out with a group if they were available or if they weren't we'd hang out just the two of us. Sometimes we'd go for walks or go shopping, but there was nothing beyond that.  

So in March, because it went so well last time I reached out, I figured I'd try again. I gave him a gift on League of Legends because I figured it'd be nice, and inquired if the group would be hanging out today. He told me that the rest of them were, but I was not invited, and chewed me out again. 
 
Since then, I've been keeping my distance a bit. Playing games when invited, or hanging out when invited, but he's still giving me the cold shoulder mostly when we're in groups. 

Last night, I decided to try to break the ice again. I've been really excited about work, and I wanted to share. He would only accept talking through text, so I shared the stuff I was excited about, and he gave me very minimal sentences to show he was (maybe) listening. I asked him how his work was going and he said, ""It's going.""

Then I asked something I shouldn't have asked. I asked if I should take the extra keyboard and mouse I left at his place for when I would bring my tower over and we would LAN (which is something we did basically ever weekend Nov-Dec when we were dating) and bring it home, and he said yes.

I've spent the last 4 months trying to fool myself into thinking maybe we could get back together, but at this point it's assuredly over. I still want to fool myself into thinking something could happen, but it hurts so much...
