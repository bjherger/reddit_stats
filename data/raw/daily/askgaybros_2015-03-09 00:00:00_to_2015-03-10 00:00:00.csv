My ex-fiance left me for one of his online gaming friends: a gorgeous American boy he'd never even met in person before. We had been together for 5 years. Within a week of his friend making sexual overtures, he dumped me. He began to visit this friend within a month or two, to officially date him within a few more, and married him within the year. 

I had (foolishly) sacrificed a great deal for my ex. I gave up the school I loved and moved back to Ottawa to support him through his chronic health problems. He had promised me that he would help me produce shows back in Ottawa, but he never did. I had napped beside him in hospital chairs when he was having kidney stones, held his hand during panic attacks, and done everything in my power to be a good partner for him, but it all meant nothing in the end.

When he proposed, he told me he wanted to grow old with me and couldn't see himself with anyone else. The inside of the ring was engraved with the words, ""Love always"". The only explanation he offered me upon the breakup was that he had proposed for ""the wrong reasons"". I feel used, as though I was just a transitional placeholder until something better came along.

I'll never really know why he left me, but I suspect that looks had something to do with it. The guy he left me for was gorgeous. Drop-dead, ""could have had any man he wanted""-gorgeous. As a gay man, I've never felt particularly attractive. We're inundated with imagery of shirtless underwear models, and, regardless of how true it is, I often feel that if you don't fall into a very specific body type and look in the gay community, you're at a serious disadvantage when it comes to dating. I'm skinny, and have difficulty gaining muscle tone. I've had very bad skin in the past, and have a deep-set brow that looks somewhat unusual on someone with my physicality.

The men I'm most interested in never seem to be into me. When I was last on Plenty of Fish, for instance, I sent out 25-30 messages and got only 2 or 3 responses (which resulted in tepid, one-sided conversation before they stopped replying altogether). I don't think I'm doing anything wrong, but it's made me feel very bitter and ugly. I recently shut down my various dating profiles because I was so frustrated with the lack of responses I was getting. 

Offline, I find it very difficult to meet people. When I do, the men I'm interested tend to be straight, already taken, or respond in a nasty, catty fashion if I talk to them. I remember asking this one guy out once. He sneered at me, curled his lip, and replied: ""People like me don't date people like YOU."" Ouch. 

I am currently hunting for counselling resources in the city geared towards LGBT folk and am looking at getting back on antidepressants, but I was wondering if anyone had any advice.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although it happened over a year and a half ago, I still find myself struggling to move past my last relationship.

We started like talking about what we would do to each other,  like handjobs, blowsjobs and anal, we kept saying ill do it like one for one but we never agreed to who would go first. 

Ok so at the movie night thing, we were sitting next to each other and we were like the only two still up and in the room, i like started joking about caressing his ass and like feeling around there, not in, working my way up to his member.  One thing led to another and we were jerking each other off intensely and we both need came at the same time, we then feel asleep on the couch spooning,  him being little spoon.

We then spoke about it on the phone later and then it was pretty cool, we then made arragnements to get together for our ' own movie night' and he came over and we were in a safe room, no parents could have walked in unless knocking-we said its cos we were focusing on the movies-and we slowly started again, jerking eachother off until we both came XD later that night we started it again, note we always had a blanket over both our laps, I then took a deep breath and put my head under the blankets and towards his hard member and started sucking it, he cummed i swallowed and he kept jerking me off but i didnt really let my load go so he was unable to finnish me of as i was expecting him to suck me to as we agreed previously. I then whispered ' one for one' and he mumbled 'later' regardless to say,  he didnt. the next day he left, us still on good notes.

Sorri, it was a lot but its kinda context that is needed, so I really like him and think he is cute but im not sure if he ignoring me or actually busing, he hasnt said anything that would lead me to believe that he no longer wants to be with me or do things with me.

Hey /r/askgaybros. I'm basically in a coming out process now and things are going fast! I'm looking forward to finding someone ASAP. I would probably be interested in something serious but I'm not ruling out some ""innocent"" play, since I'm really looking forward to trying something sexual with a guy.

However, I have a huge problem. I've always been a big germophobiac. And STDs, mainly HIV are a very very big deal to me. I've been thinking about it a lot lately, like what would happen if I were to contract HIV, I always start picturing how my life would be like, if I could live with it and it always ends with me picturing myself commiting suicide and nearly in tears.

Pathetic, I know, but I need to overcome this fear somehow. I've recently studied up about HIV. The fact that there is a non-zero chance even with french kissing (because of some micro-bruises in your mouth) terrifies me to no end. I also would really like how oral sex feels like (in either position), but that's also risky (and I would probably have to use a condom, which sounds weird for a BJ).

If I were to find someone I clicked with, I would probably have to bring them to test before we do something, but I really don't want to look like I don't trust the guy. Plus, there would probably be some kissing beforehand and how much of a fucking nutcase would I look like if I asked him to go get tested before we kissed?! Plus some random hookup will probably go find someone else before going to a test for my paranoid ass.

I want to pursue something but there's this constant fear, this ""non-zero chance"" and it's been eating me from inside lately. Any of you bros were in a similiar situation? Any advice?

popular gay bar in my city for the first time....alone. In the
end I had a fun and awesome night. But I struggled for a good
hour and a half wondering like a lost little puppy in the crowd.
I'm usually sociable,but I need a posse to back me up. Got
approached by a group of dudes , they asked me if I was single
and looking cos one of their friends is,he wasn't really my type so
I politely turned him down but I figured these guys aren't bad
so I stuck around and danced with them and got introduced to 
their acquaintances as the night progressed. Thanks to them I had
an awesome night haha.I exchanged numbers with them.

Big mistake I made was I allowed this one creepy dude to grind on me 
and entertained him,I thought he was just being friendly(WTF) then he
asked me if we could make out and that's when I left him.
I'm definitely going back when I get the time again and I may have
to do it alone again if the people I met won't be available to hang
out or  if they are busy.

Any suggestions on how to meet people in a gay bar alone? Most gay
friends I already had before this are from my old high school and they
are busy af (graduated 2014,I took  a year off school,will be returning 
to school on  September) I think approaching a crowd is just,weird and 
awkward for me.
","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I finally got the nerve and the balls to go to the most
popular gay bar in my city for the first time....alone. In the
end I had a fun and awesome night. But I struggled for a good
hour and a half wondering like a lost little puppy in the crowd.
I&amp;#39;m usually sociable,but I need a posse to back me up. Got
approached by a group of dudes , they asked me if I was single
and looking cos one of their friends is,he wasn&amp;#39;t really my type so
I politely turned him down but I figured these guys aren&amp;#39;t bad
so I stuck around and danced with them and got introduced to 
their acquaintances as the night progressed. Thanks to them I had
an awesome night haha.I exchanged numbers with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big mistake I made was I allowed this one creepy dude to grind on me 
and entertained him,I thought he was just being friendly(WTF) then he
asked me if we could make out and that&amp;#39;s when I left him.
I&amp;#39;m definitely going back when I get the time again and I may have
to do it alone again if the people I met won&amp;#39;t be available to hang
out or  if they are busy.&lt;/p&gt;

So I recently started experimenting (?) with a friend that I made on Tinder who's ""pansexual"" or whatever you want to call it. We've become very good friends over the past 6-7 weeks. He's not done much with other guys besides oral and I think even as far as that goes his experience is quite limited. I'm not terribly experienced in general either. I've bottomed maybe 6-7 times in total now and never topped as I have horrible condom anxiety.

Anyway, we've now done anal on two occasions, both of which I've enjoyed myself moderately but he's been pretty indifferent to it. Naturally, we use condoms. Most of the tops I've been with have been much more experienced so they've done most of the work but it kind of falls to me in this situation now and I have no idea what to do. I want him to enjoy it more but as I haven't topped myself I'm not entirely sure what feels good for him. I've been on top both occasions and just kind of... bounced around? It kind of feels like we're two very inexperienced guys fumbling around.

Getting to the point, do you gaybros have any suggestions for making things better? Any sort of, uh, techniques I could try? Or is this just bad sex? Short of barebacking, which I wouldn't call out of the question as I do trust him, I'm not entirely confident that there's much else I can do and I can't exactly just make him take control.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;throwaway, some things are embarrassing to ask, even for me&lt;/p&gt;

A lot of my friends know that I like guys, but only a few know that I'm gay (I told the others I was bi.) My parents don't know, but I'll get to that later. I apologize in advance if this turns into pure rambling.

 I'll start off with how I act. While I'll admit I can act and talk feminine and a higher than normal voice, I don't do a lot of the things associated with gay guys. I don't love shopping, I don't talk with a ""gay"" accent, etc.

Now onto how I feel about sex and relationships. One thing I hate is when people ask if I would be the guy or the girl in a relationship. It's called *gay* for a reason! There's two guys (or two girls), not a guy and a girl. I'm not even into feminine guys. Guys that act overly feminine turn me off. A somewhat high voice and some ""feminine"" speech (patterns?) are fine, but I would never date a guy who acts like a complete girl. Would I be their friend and respect them? Of course. But I wouldn't date them.

Here's the big one: I never want to have gay sex. The thought of sticking my penis in a guys ass/mouth or vice versa does not turn me on at all. I also don't like porn, and I'm not ashamed of that. The furthest I would go with a guy is mutual masturbation, which I think about a lot. Everyone else probably finds this weird/thinks that I will like gay sex in the future, but no. I just don't want to have sex like that. This means I'm going to be a virgin forever, since mutual masturbation is technically not sex.

I also never want to marry a man. Not for religious reasons. Not because I'm afraid of what people will think. I don't have any desire to marry a man and never will. I've always wanted to marry a woman and have kids, but seeing that life is not going to allow that, I'll just stick to dating (if that ever happens). Don't try to convince me otherwise.

I'm frustrated about all of this and the guys that I like. I've only spoken to the guy I like three times in person. I direct messaged him a few times, but he blocked me when I asked him in a group message with a bunch of other people if he wanted to come to my friends party. So, he dislikes me.

Now, onto something trickier. There is a possibility that I like my friend (we'll call him Gregory, but that's not his real name). I've known Gregory since 9th grade and have always thought he was pretty cute. However, I don't like him the same way I like the guy I like for sure. Whenever I see the guy I like for sure, my heart starts racing and in my mind I'm like ""oh gosh, that guy's hot/cute af"". But when I see Gregory, I don't feel like that. He's cute, but I don't feel the same way. I like his personality more, though. He's really funny and nice and seems like a lot of fun. I catch myself staring at him sometimes in class if he's not looking. I would not mine (and think I might even enjoy) hugging or kissing him. If I like Gregory, it's a different kind of liking than I've had before.

Gregory already has a boyfriend, too. While I ship them and am very happy for them, part of me is a bit sad.  Even if Gregory wasn't dating anyone, I don't think he would like me that way.

My main reason for posting this was to show the reddit community how I'm different and to get feedback relating to it. However, I would like advice on my current situation involving Gregory, if it's not too much trouble. Thank you for reading!

&lt;p&gt;My main reason for posting this was to show the reddit community how I&amp;#39;m different and to get feedback relating to it. However, I would like advice on my current situation involving Gregory, if it&amp;#39;s not too much trouble. Thank you for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. Feel free to ask any questions relating to Gregory or anything else I&amp;#39;ve mentioned. They can only help me.&lt;/p&gt;

Married a great guy last year and it was truly a dream for me .we had a super cool gay wedding with both our families in attendance. 

well several months afterwards I saw old messages on his phone within viber. then I was fu@king crushed. I saw he was hooking up with other guys and/or planning to meet up most with others most.of the time we we were dating. I.was like wtf was going on. it was pretty bad since on at least 2 instances I read he was in the airport planing to meet me for a weekend getaway...holding flowers and all...yikes! another occasion we had just returned from a trip to meet his friends and get.introduced.

FML! I confronted him about it with everything in writing his own words and he denied it saying the dates are wrong in his phone settings.which was a crappy lie. He finally gave a half hearted apology stating only that he was sorry ""for whatever I thought he did"".

I really tried to put this into perspective but it has not been easy. what bothers me the most is what appears to be a lack of remorse and even hostility  towards me...the idea.from him is to sweep it under the carpet and pretend like nothing ever happened. Perhaps I could if I saw some genuine remorse and a true appreciation for how trust was broken.... we agreed to be monogamous..that was never in question.

I tried to put it behind us but about 8 weeks after that I saw one of the guys contacted him on viber..writing ""hey dear hey baby where are you""...he didn't reply to it(btw we sometimes share phones which makes me think maybe he even wanted me to.see these things!)
if I would have seen a reply that stated im married now so please don't contact me.....I would have been at ease. But nothing was there.

So now I am at a crossroads. if I.knew any of these things I would have never asked him to marry me..I would have dumped him.
I try to figure out why he would do this and so easily lie to me. it's not about sex  since that was always great with us....and I'm not being arrogant but I'm a really great looking muscle dude....so is he. my fear is he needs or likes attention from others. I only need him....now I have to decide to stay or go or try to work it out. I didn't go into this marriage as a short term thing.....it is for life .....Uhhh FML.....

For employment purposes, I'm not using my real account because it's easily traced back to my real identity. But anyways...

Last week I tried to kill myself. I took a lethal dose of medication (Yes - I knew what I was doing), as well as prepared a shotgun to shoot myself if I had an atypical reaction. What ended up happening is somewhat fuzzy, but my understanding was that I had some indegestion after having the pills and antacids, lost consciousness, and was transported to a hospital. My time in general and psychiatric hospitalizations were uneventful (and fortunately Denton county covered my stay) and I was discharged from all care to an outpatient level after a week or so, leading to where I am today - back at my apartment.

Outside of some serious fatigue and drowsiness, I am physically well. I don't have any family or friends, and the acquaintances I told about this incident blew it off. I am meeting with university officials on Monday to figure out what the course of action will be on that end (I was taking 18 hours but didn't go to class). Rent is paid but I need to figure out if I'm staying in this town by the end of next week, because I have to figure out if I'm going to apply for financial aid, a renewed lease, and register for fall classes by next week.

While those are decisions I'd do automatically, now is probably the worst time to be thinking about my future. In all seriousness, I really shouldn't be alive right now. Just thinking about the situation makes me think ""what the fuck."" I have no idea how I'm going to recover from this - I liquidated a lot of my digital and fiscal assets to assist my beneficiary.

Also, I really don't know what to spend my time doing right now, because I don't feel like doing anything. Perhaps I'm slipping into depression again, but I don't feel a thing right now.

Now, I'd like to ask for a little advice. Supposing you had locked yourself away and disengaged from everyone since the new years, and had no idea what was going on in the world, what would you do today?

There is this boy, lets call him R who is same age as me, same school, same grade. We have been on and off good friends,  never being like upset or angry at one another, for about four years.  late last year we became good friends again and kinda started flirting but in a very sarcastic way, also I dont know his true sexual identity, we stopped for a while but recently started again. He is really cute. 
we say things like:
Me: I know you want me
R: my house now  ;)
Etc :other thinfs aswell,  like him sending me cute dog pics saying thing like I got you a rose cause I wuv you
And lots of emojis like hearts and kissing. 
So its not very definite. He really good looking so im sure he would have had a girlfriend before but no he hasnt, he only hangs around guys.

He is shorter than me and is blonde,  just a bit of info that might motivate any one to help me.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay so, Im fifteen and closet bisexual. There is this boy, lets call him R who is same age as me, same school, same grade. We have been on and off good friends,  never being like upset or angry at one another, for about four years.  late last year we became good friends again and kinda started flirting but in a very sarcastic way, also I dont know his true sexual identity, we stopped for a while but recently started again. He is really cute. 
we say things like:
Me: I know you want me
R: my house now  ;)
Etc :other thinfs aswell,  like him sending me cute dog pics saying thing like I got you a rose cause I wuv you
And lots of emojis like hearts and kissing. 
So its not very definite. He really good looking so im sure he would have had a girlfriend before but no he hasnt, he only hangs around guys. He doesn&amp;#39;t know my sexuality but he knows ive had previous girlfriends. I really want to be friends with him even more and then maybe ask him out. I really like him,  so please any advice to find out if he is really flirting or really interested or even any help with befriending him even more would be hugely appreciated.

I'm confused and just want to see if anyone else has had this happen or something like that

I've known I was gay since the beginning of high school which is about 6 years now. I'm attracted to guys, I wanna be with guys, and I couldn't be less interested with girls, gay, right? But I was very uncomfortable and hated myself with being ""different"" (this being high school and all) and wasn't as strong as some other people who were able to come to terms and come out during high school. So I never, ever acted on it. I never dated, never talked about it, never got to be with a guy. 

Now I'm about 2 years out of high school and in a community college. I never thought I'd be ok with being gay and as i mentioned before i really hated myself for it so I didn't think i'd ever come out. But the past few months I've been able to accept myself partially, and I think im actually on a really good road to being happy. I'm also not out at all, this bit of info might provide more of an understanding for my actual question coming up. 

Only been with 2 guys. The first was an older guy (40s) when I was 17 and i really regretted doing it afterwards because this was still at a time when I hated myself. It happened once and I felt bad so I never did it again. But I met a guy a month ago and started hanging out with him. I like him. And at this point I was pretty damn confident I'm gay, seeing as I am not attracted to women in the slightest, and I check out guys and want to have sex with guys. That's usually a pretty good indicator you're gay. But when I'm with this guy, Im afraid to kiss him?I almost dread it. He really likes kissing me but I can't say I like kissing back. 
I feel uncomfortable when we kiss or make out. I've never really done it before, so it's still a bit shocking. I dont know exactly how to describe how it feels, it's not that I don't like it, but it feels weird. I end up laughing or breaking away and he asks me why I don't like kissing him, but I don't know why. I am attracted to guys, but kissing him makes me feel uncomfortable? I'm also afraid to go further with him. I love cuddling, it feels great. Kissing feels uncomfortable, and I can't picture myself sucking him off either. I want him to do all these things for me but the thought of recipricating makes me feel uneasy. 

Is it some sort of unresolved hatred of myself that I haven't gotten over yet? Am I just nervous? Am I just moving too quick? I'm not sure why I feel uneasy or uncomfortable kissing a guy or doing anything sexual if I've known I'm gay for so long","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;ve lurked here for a while but I&amp;#39;ve never seen anyone else ask a question like this and I&amp;#39;m beginning to feel like it&amp;#39;s not all that common?
