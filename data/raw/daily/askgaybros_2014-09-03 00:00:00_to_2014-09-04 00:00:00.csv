I'm... not having any kind of crisis. I'm just a little sad because the guy I was dating broke it off. I think being a little sad is OK, for a week or so, anyway. We weren't married, we weren't even serious or exclusive or even sexual... I just had hopes, that I thought he shared, and affection that I thought he returned, and excitement for the promise of the future that didn't pan out. None of this strikes me as unusual or bad--toss in a little STI and you've got the known risks of dating--it's just, there are lots of feelings. 

I obviously don't want to waste my life mourning something that smoldered for six weeks and then fizzled out, but I also don't want to repress my, well, little grief and have it bubble back to the surface in six months or a year as anger or shame. I want to find that balance: feel bad now, move on soon.

He used to say things like ""I like you"", ""you make so happy"", or ""you've earned the key to my heart""...just sweet talk. But he doesn't do that anymore.

Funny thing is that, when he and I started dating, he pursued me, and I'd like that back.

I know that he and I haven't dated long, but he and I have bonded really well. He and I admitted that it felt like we've known each other for years.

I know that this relationship has great potential, but I'm the problem due to my inexperience.

I hope that people in a lasting and successful relationship can talk some sense into me.

I manage a few weeks but then the stress of life, school and ADHD gets so overwhelming I just keep relapsing. It's not only the drugs but my entire life and my inability to be consistent in anything. I honestly keep thinking that I maybe should embrace my addiction and just go with it and go out with a blast so to speak.

I tried asking for help from my family but they're not interested. I haven't told them about my addiction and I suspect they'd just make the situation worse by overreacting.

I went to NA and found the focus on the program a bit off-putting. All I wanted was to talk to someone without them pulling the fire-alarms. I intended to visit more but I guess I just forgot about it.

The drugs aren't the real issue to be honest. I can comfortably stop abusing them for a few weeks. The hard part is filling the void with something else. To just deal with life but I keep failing.

I&amp;#39;ve tried stopping multiple times but I just can&amp;#39;t. I manage a few weeks but then the stress of life, school and ADHD gets so overwhelming I just keep relapsing. It&amp;#39;s not only the drugs but my entire life and my inability to be consistent in anything. I honestly keep thinking that I maybe should embrace my addiction and just go with it and go out with a blast so to speak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried asking for help from my family but they&amp;#39;re not interested. I haven&amp;#39;t told them about my addiction and I suspect they&amp;#39;d just make the situation worse by overreacting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to NA and found the focus on the program a bit off-putting. All I wanted was to talk to someone without them pulling the fire-alarms. I intended to visit more but I guess I just forgot about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drugs aren&amp;#39;t the real issue to be honest. I can comfortably stop abusing them for a few weeks. The hard part is filling the void with something else. To just deal with life but I keep failing. I want to talk to someone but no one seems interested. I just feel so unlikeable. I just hate myself. I&amp;#39;ll probably just overdose on purpose if it goes on for much longer. Fuck.&lt;/p&gt;

The thing is he's not perfect but I love him and his family (who I've met a lot) and I don't want to lose him for something that might just be a desire for sex with someone else. But at the same time if I'm having these feelings then maybe it isn't to be?

Maybe this will help other shy people in social party settings learn from my mistakes.


tldr; I met someone at dragon con this past weekend and can't get him out of my head. Had the chance to seal the deal and biffed it hard because I'm a puss. Wishing I'd have handled it differently.


If you're curious to know the story and how I fucked this up read on:


My friends spent a lot of time trying to hook me up because they think I need it. I wasn't opposed to it and it was a little exciting I must say. All con I struck out until the last night when there was a glimmer of hope and damn he was the best looking one of them all.


We made our way down to the Hyatt pool area where there was a dance party going on. I saw this super hot guy (I'll call him red shirt) who looked like he was having a good time. I'm a bit shy and by this point I was having a real hard time getting any buzz on after drinking all weekend long (my liquid courage was low). I also had no idea if he was gay which makes finding someone that much harder.


My friend who didn't even know I was scoping this guy out walks over to him and starts talking to him. I never knew what he said to him until later that night (He blatantly asked the guy ""Do you like the D?"", first question. My friend is fucking crazy.). Red shirt said yes and my friend called me over. I can't believe it worked and my friend actually found me a hottie.


I got so fucking nervous. I'm used to apps and shit so I felt put on the spot and couldn't think. My friend did his part and jumped. The guy was definitely drunk I think but damnit so good looking. Like maybe out of my league looking. He was a total gaybro which I haven't seen in a LONG time. He yells my name since after my friend introduced me and is like ""Give me a hug man"". So I give him a one arm hug with a beer in my other hand. He's like ""Don't one arm me give me a real hug"". So I laugh and give a two arm hug. Then he's says ""that's a LITTLE better"". I say ""Let me try that again then."" and give him another big ass hug. 


We chat for maybe 2min. He says something along the lines of this whole weekend he's not talked to anyone attractive and that I ""stand out"" and am good looking and that I must workout etc. Then he talks about how we're both good looking people and I freeze up. 


**Mistake #1:** I should have complimented him back. His shirt was cute and physically I liked everything. His body, hair, face, shirt, it was all hot. There were a million things I could have said and I fucking froze. All I could think was that I need more booze to loosen me up so I say, ""I need a drink."" 


He says he doesn't have one. My friend was running the speaker playing the music at this dance party and was pouring out free shots from a bottle. I get the guy to come over with me and we do shots. Then we start dancing.


The dancing didn't last for long.


**Mistake #2:** I didn't get up in there. We were dancing to the music then suddenly he sort of spaces out and bounces out and rolls over to some other folks. Damn.


I don't know if he knew them or what but it was a downer. I kept dancing on my own trying to play it off but doing so horribly. I watched red shirt bounce from group to group and he'd chat with them for a min or two then bounce to the next group.


He circled back around towards me and started dancing again and said ""come dance closer!"". Sweet! I'm back in. I moved closer and he says, ""it's better when you're closer"".


**Mistake #3:** I didn't learn from mistake #2. Get the FUCK UP IN THERE. Gdamn it if I wasn't such a puss I'd had done things to him right there. I did move closer but what I should have done is get right up to him and put my arms around him or on his waist. Start getting physical. Instead I keep the invisible boundary up and he bounces again. Fuck.


At this point I'm starting to question my ability to hold red shirt's attention vs his ability to stay focused and what are his motives. I start getting depressed which isn't helping my self confidence. I seem him start talking to some shirtless guy and it gets me a little jealous. I watched him (fuck I'm a creep) and I think he was showing him random pictures or something so I try not to make much of it.


He circles around again and dances with me for another 60s and then looks me in the eye and says ""Hey, we'll bump later!"" then bounces out again to some other folks in the crowd. I don't know if bumping means dancing or fucking. I sort of lock up again.


**Mistake #4:** Get his fucking number asshole (the asshole would be me here)! I should have grabbed him and got his digits so I could find him later. You see, this dance party was mobile because the con volunteers didn't like us hanging out in the same spot too long and kept forcing us to move. Well no sooner when he bounced for the last time did we get kicked out of the pool area and had to move.


As I was leaving I noticed red shirt  had lost his red shirt (daaamn) and was living it up with a small group of people. I was talking with my other friend not sure what to do. She was unsure of the guy because his focus seemed all over the place but at the same time I was fixated on him. Even him bouncing around as much as it was making me feel crappy made me find him more hot. What the hell is up with that?


I decided to concede defeat and left with my friends. All night long I regretted not staying there and manning the fuck up. I kept looking through the crowds in hopes of finding him again so I could get a second chance. I never saw him again. When I went to bed that night my heart was pounding over the excitement of it all and I couldn't stop thinking about it.


Now the con is over and I'm back home and I still can't get him out of my head. It's all I can think about. I've not had a guy linger in my head like this since I can't remember when. I like the feeling and hate it at the same time. For all I know even if things worked out differently it's not like he'd likely be from the same town but god one night dancing (or other things ;) ) with him would have felt so fucking good.


I fucked this up so bad I should go back to school. Learn from my mistakes and don't do what I did and go get him!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Want to share my experience. Maybe this will help other shy people in social party settings learn from my mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tldr; I met someone at dragon con this past weekend and can&amp;#39;t get him out of my head. Had the chance to seal the deal and biffed it hard because I&amp;#39;m a puss. Wishing I&amp;#39;d have handled it differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re curious to know the story and how I fucked this up read on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friends spent a lot of time trying to hook me up because they think I need it. I wasn&amp;#39;t opposed to it and it was a little exciting I must say. All con I struck out until the last night when there was a glimmer of hope and damn he was the best looking one of them all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made our way down to the Hyatt pool area where there was a dance party going on. I saw this super hot guy (I&amp;#39;ll call him red shirt) who looked like he was having a good time. I&amp;#39;m a bit shy and by this point I was having a real hard time getting any buzz on after drinking all weekend long (my liquid courage was low). I also had no idea if he was gay which makes finding someone that much harder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friend who didn&amp;#39;t even know I was scoping this guy out walks over to him and starts talking to him. I never knew what he said to him until later that night (He blatantly asked the guy &amp;quot;Do you like the D?&amp;quot;, first question. My friend is fucking crazy.). Red shirt said yes and my friend called me over. I can&amp;#39;t believe it worked and my friend actually found me a hottie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got so fucking nervous. I&amp;#39;m used to apps and shit so I felt put on the spot and couldn&amp;#39;t think. My friend did his part and jumped. The guy was definitely drunk I think but damnit so good looking. Like maybe out of my league looking. He was a total gaybro which I haven&amp;#39;t seen in a LONG time. He yells my name since after my friend introduced me and is like &amp;quot;Give me a hug man&amp;quot;. So I give him a one arm hug with a beer in my other hand. He&amp;#39;s like &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t one arm me give me a real hug&amp;quot;. So I laugh and give a two arm hug. Then he&amp;#39;s says &amp;quot;that&amp;#39;s a LITTLE better&amp;quot;. I say &amp;quot;Let me try that again then.&amp;quot; and give him another big ass hug. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We chat for maybe 2min. He says something along the lines of this whole weekend he&amp;#39;s not talked to anyone attractive and that I &amp;quot;stand out&amp;quot; and am good looking and that I must workout etc. Then he talks about how we&amp;#39;re both good looking people and I freeze up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mistake #1:&lt;/strong&gt; I should have complimented him back. His shirt was cute and physically I liked everything. His body, hair, face, shirt, it was all hot. There were a million things I could have said and I fucking froze. All I could think was that I need more booze to loosen me up so I say, &amp;quot;I need a drink.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He says he doesn&amp;#39;t have one. My friend was running the speaker playing the music at this dance party and was pouring out free shots from a bottle. I get the guy to come over with me and we do shots. Then we start dancing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dancing didn&amp;#39;t last for long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mistake #2:&lt;/strong&gt; I didn&amp;#39;t get up in there. We were dancing to the music then suddenly he sort of spaces out and bounces out and rolls over to some other folks. Damn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if he knew them or what but it was a downer. I kept dancing on my own trying to play it off but doing so horribly. I watched red shirt bounce from group to group and he&amp;#39;d chat with them for a min or two then bounce to the next group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He circled back around towards me and started dancing again and said &amp;quot;come dance closer!&amp;quot;. Sweet! I&amp;#39;m back in. I moved closer and he says, &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s better when you&amp;#39;re closer&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mistake #3:&lt;/strong&gt; I didn&amp;#39;t learn from mistake #2. Get the FUCK UP IN THERE. Gdamn it if I wasn&amp;#39;t such a puss I&amp;#39;d had done things to him right there. I did move closer but what I should have done is get right up to him and put my arms around him or on his waist. Start getting physical. Instead I keep the invisible boundary up and he bounces again. Fuck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I&amp;#39;m starting to question my ability to hold red shirt&amp;#39;s attention vs his ability to stay focused and what are his motives. I start getting depressed which isn&amp;#39;t helping my self confidence. I seem him start talking to some shirtless guy and it gets me a little jealous. I watched him (fuck I&amp;#39;m a creep) and I think he was showing him random pictures or something so I try not to make much of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He circles around again and dances with me for another 60s and then looks me in the eye and says &amp;quot;Hey, we&amp;#39;ll bump later!&amp;quot; then bounces out again to some other folks in the crowd. I don&amp;#39;t know if bumping means dancing or fucking. I sort of lock up again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mistake #4:&lt;/strong&gt; Get his fucking number asshole (the asshole would be me here)! I should have grabbed him and got his digits so I could find him later. You see, this dance party was mobile because the con volunteers didn&amp;#39;t like us hanging out in the same spot too long and kept forcing us to move. Well no sooner when he bounced for the last time did we get kicked out of the pool area and had to move.&lt;/p&gt;

as I threw out my cup, the girl, who was right up against the HOT boy she was kissing, starts taking selfies, of them with the harbor behind them.

I offer to take a pic for them - just being nice -- no hidden agenda.  She smiles, says ""SURE - THANKS"" and kinda pulls back from her BF.

WOW - not only is he a fucking 10, but he has on loose basketball shorts and when she moves away his big huge hard cock sticks straight out.  huge tent.

I started to hold the iPhone sideways to get the whole view of the harbor, but decided his bulge was prettier.  I turned the phone up and down and made sure to get his huge bulge in the pics.

No more to the story, but I bet they laughed when they looked at the photos and saw his huge cock at attention.

Was the highlight of my day!

So here goes: I'm gay (:P surprise surpriiise) and recently I went to a gay talk group (yes, my choice of words is quite poor). Our last meeting was to go gay out and I loved it. Nothing happened tho, but I had a wonderful time and that what it's all about, right? But now, I'm back to square one: I probably won't meet the gays from the group for a long time. I don't know any other gay people. I want to go out, have fun. I tried a social gay site to meet some new gay friends and have fun, but that didn't really work. 

I don't necessarily want to go out to get laid, even though the title gives of that message.

But recently I get the feeling that I need to have sex to move on, and I know that doesn't make a lot of sense. This is not some horny teenager speaking. I just have the feeling in order to get along with other gays (nonsexually) I need to have had sex. (English grammar ok here? :P) And my only option seems Grindr but I have no idea if this is wise to do. :S","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys, bet you get a lot of these but I need some advice and this community seems helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
