Not ""warned"" because reasons.

Although, this might be lengthy. For that you really have been warned. 


Back in high school, when I was still a questioning and confused football player, I took up a theater arts class to get rid of some credits. On the first day of class, in walks this adorable guy. He had a big smile that warmed my heart. Shit, it still warms my heart just thinking about it. I looked at his attire and see that he has on a sweater that a part of a YouTuber's merch. A YouTuber I myself am a huge fan of, though I wasn't as expressive about it. Since that day, I always dug the kid. 


So, a couple of months pass and I end up quitting football ([story found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/2fw2cl/trying_to_fall_in_love_with_sports_again/)) and i ended up joining our schools drama club, as acting was something I was good at and it was something I enjoyed. A little ways down the road, the dude joins the drama club as well. Awesome. I got to know him a lot better, and I found out we have a lot more in common than just being fans of one YouTuber. We loved the same music, same books, same shows, everything you'd want from a guy. He was ambitious. He knew what he wanted out of life and I loved it. Honestly, it was a turn on. I was really starting to fall for him. 


Now the common question; Is he gay? Yes, he very much is. I knew it at the time with out him having to tell me. He's not a flamer, but there were things here and there that pointed to the fact that he was gay. He's just one of those. I asked his friends in our club who knew him a lot better than I did of what they thought. They all said the same thing. ""I'm 100% sure he is, but he says he isn't."" Great. I'm falling for another closeted guy. What else is new? Anyway, as much as I wanted to pursue something, I decided to let things go for the time being, as I did not want to push him into anything he wasn't comfortable with. But, you know when you just look at somebody you're interested in and you *just know* that they're going to be part go your future soon? It was like that. So I let him go, but didn't keep my eye off him.


Between now and then, he has made indications that he's into me. I've asked al my friends if I'm just being hopeful about his indication, but they agree that he's into me. Great. Now i just have to wait for him to be more comfortable with himself. 


Fast forward to today. We are now both in college. Both in different schools in different cities. I go to a local university while he went to a big time great school, pursuing his dream. His school and city are very much gay friendly, so naturally, he really got out of his shell and I'm really proud of him for that. Only thing I'm not happy about is that he now has a boyfriend that he seems to be enamored with. Honestly, I don't like the boyfriend, that's not just the jealousy talking. I don't mean to sound shallow, but he's very out of my dude's league. I know, and all my friends agree (even though it's their jobs to agree) that I am and can be a much better significant other for him. As happy as i am for him, it still breaks my heart. The dude  that i was convinced was convicted was my prince charming was was in the arms of another, all because i didn't want to make a move when i had the chance. I still try to talk to him every now and then, but it's been a lot less for obvious reasons.


Soon, I am gong to be moving cities. I'm not going to be exactly in his city, but a hell a lot closer, making it very easy for me to see him. (No, I am not moving just for him, these are plans I've had for a while now.) 


Im a helpless romantic bros, is it stupid of me to me hopeful about all this? Should I try to keep contact with him and just wait till he's single and ready? Should I pull a cliche move and steal the guy from the clutches of the wrong guy? Is this post pointless and I'm just overthinking things? Let me know!

(Should I ""settle"" for a guy due to lack of interesting prospective partners?)

The other day, the guy I have been seeing for the past 10 months asked me if I wanted to turn our close, erotic friendship (?) into a true relationship. He is 47 and I am freshly 20. I let him down easy, stating that while I cared for him quite a bit (I truly do), I couldn't see us being together due to the HUGE gap in income and where we are in our respective lives. Basically, I said I wanted to be with someone younger. He took it quite well (I even saw him tonight), however soon after having this conversation it dawned on me that I haven't met any other homosexual young men that I am remotely interested in. Its not from lack of trying, either: I am a mentor at my university's gay student union and I actively go on dates with boys my age whom I meet through Tinder or friends. While I avoid hooking up, I go on a first or second date about once every week. However, I find the boys I am meeting to be all around boring, without unique interests, skills, or goals that I find interesting. We spend our dates talking about typical topics: music, friends, school, books (when I'm lucky), and hobbies, yet I haven't met anyone who's really caught my attention (and dear lord, why does every discussion about music skew invariably towards Lana Delray?!). On top of this (I know, this is shallow) I have found all but one of them to be physically unattractive. I feel like I can't even make a physical, let alone emotional connection with any boys my age. And no, I wish it was because I was only attracted to mature men: I have met two boys in my life that I was honestly prepared to love. One was my current best friend from back home and the other a friend on my track team here at my college. Of course, both boys are straight: I knew I could never have either of them from the start and instead of ruining our respective friendships by telling them, I invested my romantic energy into being as positive, supportive, and altruistic towards them as possible (think Kaworu Nagisa). I think I'm only attracted to boys with whom I have built a prior friendship with; ones with whom I share common everyday experiences. I want a boy who makes me laugh, who I can engage with in conversation, who I can be proud of, who's driven and will push me to succeed. And yes, a boy who I find physically attractive (think: 'let's workout together!')
So I guess what I'm trying to ask is: should I settle for less? I'm tired of being lonely and I know plenty of guys who have shown an interest. Have any of you dated someone and eventually found yourself liking them? Are there any other avenues you think I can utilize to meet guys? Is this a normal situation? Or should I just wait? ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Should I pursue a relationship with someone I&amp;#39;m not really that taken with? (Should I &amp;quot;settle&amp;quot; for a guy due to lack of interesting prospective partners?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other day, the guy I have been seeing for the past 10 months asked me if I wanted to turn our close, erotic friendship (?) into a true relationship. He is 47 and I am freshly 20. I let him down easy, stating that while I cared for him quite a bit (I truly do), I couldn&amp;#39;t see us being together due to the HUGE gap in income and where we are in our respective lives. Basically, I said I wanted to be with someone younger. He took it quite well (I even saw him tonight), however soon after having this conversation it dawned on me that I haven&amp;#39;t met any other homosexual young men that I am remotely interested in. Its not from lack of trying, either: I am a mentor at my university&amp;#39;s gay student union and I actively go on dates with boys my age whom I meet through Tinder or friends. While I avoid hooking up, I go on a first or second date about once every week. However, I find the boys I am meeting to be all around boring, without unique interests, skills, or goals that I find interesting. We spend our dates talking about typical topics: music, friends, school, books (when I&amp;#39;m lucky), and hobbies, yet I haven&amp;#39;t met anyone who&amp;#39;s really caught my attention (and dear lord, why does every discussion about music skew invariably towards Lana Delray?!).

Like I said, I cum really fast.  It doesn't matter if I'm masturbating, getting a BJ, handjob, or having sex...it just erupts out of nowhere.  It's embarrassingly bad.  A guy sucks me for like a minute and we have to stop because I get so close to coming.  I'd ideally like to top, but as soon as I put it inside an ass, I cum.  Once I even came before I even fully inserted, like when it starts to tickle before you actually even get tickled.  Even worse, a few times I've accidentally jizzed my pants while making out with a guy.  

At first, I thought this was an inexperience thing, but now six years and many, many dudes later, it's still an issue.  I've practiced and practiced and done exercises and edged and everything, but nothing helps.  I'm still working on it and will continue to work on it, but for the time being, I've accepted I'm a quick cummer.

How should I approach this?  Should I give guys a heads up?  It sucks like going to someone's apartment only for me to last like ten minutes, if that.  I'm 24 years old now, so playing the cute ""oops, I came early"" card is becoming increasingly difficult.  I also try my best to make sure the other guy is still having fun, but sometimes post-orgasm, it's really hard.

Another huge problem is that I come a lot, like stream after stream.  So sometimes if the other guy touches it too much and I try to hold back, it just erupts and tons of cum flies everywhere.  If I'm not careful, comforters, blankets, pillows, a cat, etc. get covered in my manjuice.  I always feel bad when that happens.

Any advice would be appreciated on how to address this before hookups happen, if at all.  Also, I've read lots and lots, but if you know of any unique or interesting ways to practice lasting longer, please let me know!  I really need to get myself to have more stamina.

To start: I am 24. For the past few years now, I occasionally get what I would term a ""surge of horniness"" in the middle of the night, typically around 2:00am. This doesn't happen more frequently than once a month, but when it does, I become nearly feral. It's like a 15-minute long haze of debauched carnal desire in which I could seriously go down on Patton Oswalt if the opportunity presented itself.

What impresses me is the fact that the feeling is so unbelievably intense that it nearly drives me mad. My body actually wakes me up to deal with it, and once I do, it goes away and I go back to sleep.

Is this common, or am I some sort of Bruce Banner of periodic sexual rage?

I'm really not sure what to do here, so ya gotta help me out. 

Quick backstory. I am a 24 y/o gay guy and I've been living at home with my family since I graduated college. I came out to my immediate family last spring and they all took it really well and are very supportive. My younger sister just moved out and I will be following suit soon. My younger brother (19) is home on break from college. 

So tonight after work I met my mom and brother at my sister's new place and we all had dinner there. While we were standing around talking, my brother was gesturing with his hand while he was holding his phone. He turned the screen towards me, and I was like 99% sure he was in a Grindr chat window. I saw the blue and yellow bubbles and froze. And I didn't realize it but I started staring at him. I was just completely speechless. Like he always talks about girls and is kind of a typical straight bro. He noticed me staring and that snapped me out of it. A minute or so later we moved to the couch and so I pulled out my phone and checked Grindr. 16 ft away, a profile with no photo, no description, and only the title ""420"". My brother smokes kind of a lot of weed.  
So we are all sitting on the couch and my mom gets up and leaves the room for a minute and he asks me why I was looking at him funny earlier. He had been talking about a sensitive situation (extended family bullshit) before when it happened so he thought he had said something out of line. My sister was there too and I didn't want to say something in front of her. I told him I was just staring off into space thinking about something else. 
I KNOW it was him on Grindr because we had driven separately to my sister's and I got home first (about 25 miles away from her place) and checked Grindr and saw this ""420"" profile was 2 miles away, then 1 mile, then 1000 ft, then 200 ft, and then he pulled into the driveway. 

I think he probably saw me on Grindr, and my profile has a facepic in which I am fully clothed. However, I doubt that he knows I have connected the dots. 

So should I say something to him? I'm wondering if its possible he was just using Grindr to sell weed? I mean, is that a thing people do?? Part of me want to pull him aside when I get a chance and tell him the real reason I was giving him a strange look was because I saw that he was on Grindr. My head is just spinning right now. Help?!? Has anyone else been in such a situation? I feel like this is something out of a movie. It doesn't seem like real life. What should I do???

Part of me want to pull him aside when I get a chance and tell him the real reason I was giving him a strange look was because I saw that he was on Grindr. My head is just spinning right now. Help?!? Has anyone else been in such a situation? I feel like this is something out of a movie. It doesn&amp;#39;t seem like real life. What should I do??? &lt;/p&gt;

He's not very sexual, at all. He rarely cuddles nude, he refuses to blow me, he won't touch me sensually, he's a total brick in bed. Seriously, 4 years in and I've only had sex with him two ways: missionary and him grinding-ish on top of my before he cums. I go weeks, sometimes months without sex becuz he's not in the mood/feeling nauseous/hungry/full/too hot/too cold/Elder Scrolls update/roommate coming home. To top it off, I don't remember the last time he's initiated sex(if even ever), but if I ever complain, he'll tell me I'm not initiating it properly...

This guy expects me to be a romantic sexy Disney prince every time, as if I'm chasing him pre-relationship. I've never thought I'd be working this hard for sex in my relationship, only to be turned down 80% of the times. I'm growing extremely tired of this and approaching my breaking point. I'm looking at porn more and more without masturbating becuz you never know when he wants a dick to sit on. Last time I did that, I caught an infection, which he shrugged off. Any advice?

EDIT: Thank you to those that responded. Its getting late and the moon is up(I think). I'm now going to try again to get laid. Although I doubt it's gonna happen. The prime candidates for tonight's excuses are ""I'm hungry"" and ""my brother is home from work""...his gay brother is 22 BTW.

I'm bisexual and have dated men and women, but I've never slept with a man before. I've been seeing a guy (call him Sam) for a few months, (All tinder and whatsapp and only a few dates) . He's very kind and nice and considerate, and the sheer amount of time he's put into the relationship (we tinder matched in October) makes me feel like this could be the start of something proper.

So it's getting to the point where we're definitely gonna do the deed. He's coming over Friday to stay the night, and although I've said I wanna take some more time before we go all the way, I know in the heat of the moment, horny me may take over and want to do it.
Do the bros have any advice? (all things welcome! I mightn't have done anal but I'm hardly a prude!) Also, he's told me he's almost exclusively a top.

TL;DR - Might be bottoming for the first time Friday and need some advice!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey GayBros, first post from a long time lurker!&lt;/p&gt;
