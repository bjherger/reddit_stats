So, background: I am almost 40, foreigner living in Germany, partnered with a local for 10+ years. 2 years ago I met a straight guy, let's call him Nate. We had a beer, changed numbers. We met several times, more beers. I came out to him. He's cool.

Some facts: He came to occupy a place in my life which I always wanted to have full: a straight bro. We made two short trips together. Although we don't have much in common, we only watch movies together (he's more hip-hopper, I'm more rocker; he's good at sports, I am not; etc). Last year July he moved to another city, 3 hours drive; I never felt as melancholic as I felt then. My bf was fed up of seeing me laying sad. I went to visit him a couple of times, always cool.

Now: My bf keeps telling me that I put all my heart on him, and I shouldn't. I went this year three times to his city for some business, and he never had the time to meet me. I always carried some gifts for him, and came back home with them. However, one month ago we made yet another short trip, I finally gave him the gifts. Next weekend he's coming to my city, there's a festival. He's coming with a friend if his, they'll crash at my place. I am nervous for he coming...

Am I too jealous of not spending enough time with him?

Am I just afraid of not meaning for him as much as he means for me (he's literally the most important straight man in my life) ?

Am I in love with him?

Should I better cut all contact?

Am I just being too silly or stupid?

Seriously, I am too nervous and even wishing to die! (obviously I don't tell this to my bf, but of course he notice my sadness. It annoys me; I am almost 40","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;throwaway account... sorry long text, but I am sad now&lt;/p&gt;

I met a guy that really turns me on sexually. We went on a date then back to his place n started fooling around. Everything seemed going really well. Until I noticed my knee was bleeding n a few drops fell on his white sheets right after he had asked me if he could fuck me. He immediately stopped, went completely soft, took off all his sheets to put them in the laundry, n a few minutes later I was in my car driving back home. I texted him after to tell him i had a really good time n apologized for the sheets, never got a reply. Today I texted him n after asking if we wanted to hangout tomorow he stopped replying.

So obviously I wouldnt wanna date someone who would let something so stupid turn him off so easily. But I really want him to fuck me. I'm very picky n he's everything I look for in a top. Tall, muscular, huge cut cock that stays hard as a rock, he's 18 years older then me. I feel like I won't be able to sleep until I get him to fuck me. What can I do to reattract him to me without sounding too desperate?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So this is really stupid. I met a guy that really turns me on sexually. We went on a date then back to his place n started fooling around. Everything seemed going really well. Until I noticed my knee was bleeding n a few drops fell on his white sheets right after he had asked me if he could fuck me. He immediately stopped, went completely soft, took off all his sheets to put them in the laundry, n a few minutes later I was in my car driving back home. I texted him after to tell him i had a really good time n apologized for the sheets, never got a reply. Today I texted him n after asking if we wanted to hangout tomorow he stopped replying.&lt;/p&gt;

For those of you unfamiliar with the service, it allows people all over the world to rent rooms or entire places to guests, for which you pay a nightly fee, much like a hotel. It's a superb service and I highly recommend it.

Regardless, my boyfriend and I were on very unsteady ground leading up to the trip, and after making it through the weekend, I decided to breakup with him, leaving me newly single. This is where it starts to get complicated. The owner of the apartment we stayed at was a wonderful, attractive, and educated gay man who is probably 8-12 years my senior. Although we didn't interact much outside of a few light conversations and playing a game at a dinner party he hosted while we were there, I am very interested in him. 

I typically travel to Chicago once or twice every two months, and luckily have another tripped planned for the second-to-last weekend of August. I desperately want to shoot the host a friend request and message on Facebook asking him out for an evening together, but I'm unsure. Is that an awkward situation in the making? I certainly don't want him to feel uncomfortable, but the interaction we had led me to think he was interested in me despite my then relationship status. 

Should I say fuck it and just go for it? If so, is it too forward to ask him out to dinner and maybe a night out on the town? Or go for something far more relaxed? There's a lot of factors at play here.

We chatted for a bit and he told me he never uses condoms. I made it clear that I wouldn't bareback. We hooked up but did not have anal. We really had a great time both in bed and afterwards.

A few days later I asked him on whatsapp about the no-condom thing (because I'd really like to have anal with him) and he revealed that he's HIV+, but taking meds and his viral load is undetectable. That's the first time I met someone HIV+ (or at least that I knew was HIV+). Knowing this, I am not afraid and still want to have fun with him. But I realize I don't know shit about what it means to date an HIV+ guy, what are the risks etc. So I'm turning to reddit for information, obviously

* He mostly bottoms. He doesn't want to use condoms because it's painful for him because of friction. This is something we'd have to solve if we ever want to have anal. I don't know what options are available on that side. Other kinds of condoms ?  
* I need to know a bit more about HIV. Because while I can roughly imagine what ""undetectable load"" means, I don't really know in practice what to do with that information. Wikipedia won't help me this time because it's not really a practical guide :p
* In general I'm not 100% sure how cautious I should be about all this. As I said, I don't bareback, but I don't use condoms for oral either. Should I consider that now ? 

TL;DR : what are options for a guy who cannot use standard condoms ? Where can I find good, practical info on HIV ? How should I act with my HIV+-treated-undetectable sex buddy ?
