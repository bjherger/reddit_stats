In short, my partner and I were together for 5 years (we're both 24 now.) At the end of our relationship, I found out that he was sleeping with our roommate the whole time, sleeping with many other guys, found adam4adam profiles, growlr, etc. I honestly always thought we were always on the same page about what we want out of the relationship, and we often talked about the important relationship things like monogamy/non-monogamy, where we want our future to take us, etc. I actually planned on proposing later this year and have already talked to his parents about it. 

Well, it turns out that he's a serial liar, and I had no idea. We mutually decided to split earlier this year, he moved out, and I also asked our roommate to move out too; I now live alone in my house. Obviously I'm having trouble with trust issues and just general sadness about the situation, but my main problem is what happens at night... 

I am fine during the day, I can keep my head up, I'm doing great at work and succeeding in every way. I've taken up some hobbies that I enjoy, keeping myself busy to not think about it all, and no one in my friend circle even thinks this is bothering me too much. When I get home at night, though, my whole world changes. I feel alone, so alone at night. My mind races through everything that has happened, my heart beats fast, I start feeling very depressed and dizzy and my body feels weak, I feel like I've lost my sanity, its really not an enjoyable experience. So far, the only ritual that can calm me down and put me to sleep is a drug cocktail I've made up for myself. 1.5mg xanax, 10mg cyclobenzaprine, a few shots of tequila and a joint or two. Thanks to the black market of drugs in this town. Next thing you know its morning again and time to get to the office. Rinse and repeat. 

I don't want to keep living this way. I hate that this has happened to me and it really hurts me deep down that I've been so betrayed and lied to for so many years by someone I loved so much. This is the second LTR I have been in where it ended with the other guy being a notorious liar. I don't know how to get over it. I've tried to see a counselor and a psychologist already but they both screwed up my initial appointments (scheduled me for one day, but told me another, and couldn't see me until much later.) Because of this I've given up hope on the idea of counseling too. Getting prepared to talk about this with a professional is really heart-wrenching, and to be blown off twice by their mistakes doesn't help me trust the industry too much. How can I get over this, guys? I've been a long time lurker and you all are some of the best people on the internet. Thanks for anything.

I've been seeing by boyfriend for over 18 months. He is my first boyfriend and I am was absolutely head over heals in love with him. I was always slightly suspicious of him from the start though. Being my first relationship I wasn't sure about how everything worked. But I would glance over his shoulder sometimes and see him messaging guys or he had new facebook friends.

About 6 months in we finished uni and moved apart. I started to get more paranoid and would start googling and looking these guys up and found they were all gay guys near where he was living. Of course this on its own means nothing, so I just buried my jealousy.

Things like this carried on, but I was so in love that it didn't really matter. About 3 months ago something just snapped. Snapchat has a 'Best Friends' feature and I could see my bf had been sending messages to this one guy (who I could see was a gay guy who lived near him), more so than he'd been messaging me. He was out drunk one night and messaged me (by accident) saying ""Why won't you let me stay at yours?"" I rang him and asked and he was all defensive and said ""oh [X] is so and sos [straight] boyfriend"" which I knew wasn't true. Next morning he sent me a message in the morning and the facebook location was on. It said he was in this apartment block, despite him saying he was staying with his friend somewhere else. I simply asked him where he stayed and he got super defensive again and started accusing me of always saying he was cheating. This is where it gets a bit stalky. I looked up this guys Instagram and he posted views out his apartment window (I could see the shop out the window, so googled it and it corresponded with where my bf sent the message from) - I feel bad for this lack of trust, but I was being lied to.

I was so upset and angry. I had never cheated before - I had been very tempted, but I always removed myself from situations and never went of Grindr etc. However this time I just wanted some revenge (ridiculous I know). Even if he hadn't slept with him, he had definitely lied.

For the past three months I have been meeting lots of random guys. Mostly for revenge purposes. Its dangerous and self destructive behaviour. I'm not in the best of places. In this process I have found my bfs accounts too, where he says he's single.

The relationship is surely doomed. I can never trust him and my behaviour is getting scary. I still love him but I also hate him. I'm just wondering what my next move should be. 

1) Be completely honest, admit by quasi-stalking and never speak again.
2) End things but don't say anything a) never speak again b) try to be friends
3) Try to work things out in the relationship

Hard. And he has a southern twang...Gahhh. Makes me freaking lose my shit thinking about. :p 

I don't know where I got the balls to do so, but he and I went for a run and I talked with him about the embarrassingly raw feelings I had for him as he was driving us through the country.

My rationale for telling him the funky shit going on in my heart was that I just had to get it out. To know where I stood. So, I laid it all out. 

He's straight, or only incidentally gay. The first thing he said was, ""Well, there's not a whole lot we can do about that. But damn, is that a garden hose or your dick? I love that you told me, and I have major respect for your chutzpah.""

He and I have remained good friends. He's living and working in Nicaragua with the Peace Corps, and I'm going to grad school and doing research in Alaska. 

He wants to Skype and catch up on stuff, and now signs messages and stuff with ""Love you.""

I'm not expecting anything (sweet Jesus, I wish it would though), but my issue is that I'm finally over him, and now he wants to deepen our friendship again. By ""over him"" I mean that I don't have this massive ache in my chest thinking about him. Totally cheesy, totally true.

Would you open up the door and deepen that friendship again? We're at separate ends of the continent, but Skype would bring his face back into my life. The idea of getting to talk with him sends me over the moon. 

Thanks for your help, advice.... Anything at all would be incredibly appreciated. :)

I'm the kind of person to dream of things I thought of passingly during the day and yesterday I read a post about a guy who had to almost fight off a guy who was touching him inappropriately at some party or whatever. And guess what I dreamt of?

In the dream I was in my mother's bedroom from our old house (now that I think about it, that detail itself was weird) and anyway, I was in her bed with a guy who I dont know and was not really my type to begin with.
He began rubbing my chest and I felt uncomfortable so I pushed off his hand. Then he began to rub my shoulder so I pushed off his hand. Then he began kissing my neck, which is something I fantasize about, and I began dozing off so he grabbed my hip that was furthest from him and slowly slid it towards him to sort of scoot me closer to him and thats when I told him to cool it, that Im not ready. But he wouldnt listen, he seemed amused. Then he tried to get on top of me so he could pin me down but I freaked out and I pushed him off me and got out of bed but where I got off, there's a piece of wall around the bed and so he was able to corner me. He was bigger than me but I can fight so I swung at him but I missed, so he swung at me and grazed my cheek but I swung back and decked him on the cheek. I then pushed him down so I could run as I don't think I'd be able to fend him off much longer but then another guy came into the room. He was about my size. Then I started freaking out even more because it felt very much like a trap. Luckily, the other guy was still down so I swung at the new guy but for some reason I felt weak and slow so missed but by the time my fist flew past him the other guy slapped me awake.

When I awoke, my heart was beating SO badly. I felt so anxious and violated. It was so weird.

One of them had always made little comments when we drunk but I figured it was just him being drunk. Recently the other half of the couple started sending pretty clear signals too and last weekend at the end of the night at a party he asked me to come home with them. 

Has anyone ever had a couple with a threesome before? I'm thinking it might be awkward and I would end up being a third wheel or worse that they're bringing me because they want to use me or something. I'm friends with both guys so I am also worried about how things would be afterwards. Although they've been trying for a while now so I guess it's been brought up enough by now it's not an awkward topic. 

Lastly, I am semi-concerned that the reason they chose me is because neither would be concerned about the other leaving them for me. I am by no means lacking self confidence but both the guys in the couple are super hot meaning 9 or 10/10 and in very good shape. It's kind of a turn off to me to think that they chose me because they think I'm cute but that they would never get left by the other for me. 

I also have very little experience with men sexually, so I'm just feeling super nervous about potentially sleeping with two hot guys who have sex all the time. 


TLDR - I am friends with a super hot couple who wants to have a threesome with me. Would it be weird? During/after? 

Also for anyone who does/has done this, is it inappropriate to ask them about their relationship?

Despite the fact that I get attracted to females, I'm equally attracted to males. But I'm especially attracted to boy-like males (twinks), feminine males, tomboys (boy-like females), especially slender males with bangs and wearing form-fitting pants.

Why am I attracted like this? Because I've been friendless for so long that I need a male embrace and companionship. I knew because I was attracted to two hetrosexual males once in my life, one of them during high school (who was a Mormon of all people.)

Other things I have is a foot and sock fetish and a attraction to pokemon (because of innate male and female aspects similar to humans) and gijinka pokemon and digimon (a possible animation fetish). The latter related to pokemon is how I found out that I was bisexual. Oh did I mention I have a desire to dress in school girl uniforms and underclothes once in a while as I do have some clothing in a hidden place. So I'm bisexual and transgender (crossdresser variant)

After about seven or so years or so of being a closet case, I was out to my mom. Who was, believe it or not, waited for me to come out to her, and respected me for who I am and my sexual orientation, despite being Christian (because same-sex relationships are prohibited because it will leads to sex, but It helped that she did not go to church regually until recently). At the same time she sugercoated the fact that she wanted me to have children and a female.

Sadly, I will never be out to my father, who is still religous, and a Nigerian (who is a African immigrant) is hostile to any mention of me as gay or bisexual and he will disown me in a heart beat especially with the fact that I'm trying to move out by the end of the year. (Its bad enough he never discussed anything about sexuality or give me sexual education, unlike my mother who taught me the basics) Did I mention at one point he said that black gays ""are a joke"" to my mom at one point.

I certainly do love him and have the utmost respect for the strength of our relationship and the history we have and continue to build.

However, a couple of days ago I had been chatting with a once-dated, now-friended gay friend of mine who is also in a relationship.  We were just making small talk, then he turned the conversation to proposition me to have myself and my boyfriend engage in a ""moresome"" with he and his boyfriend.

My gut response was to tell him that I would never do anything to jeopardize my current relationship, and I let him know that I was flattered he thought of me in that way but I loved my SO and wouldn't do anything to muck with that.

The last couple of days though, I have been really intrigued with the fantasy of having group sex and it's been making me feel incredibly guilty.  I am totally OK with doing something like this, and would have no qualms about it.  And that scares me a bit - that I know I can have a faithful, healthy relationship but also be open to sex with other people.

It's something that I would actually like to do, but I know for sure that we would both have to be on the same page about it.  We talk about everything very openly, even if it it's uncomfortable and we've been doing well because of it.

I guess what I'm asking is twofold - has anyone been in a situation like this before, and what has you experience been like?  Are gay relationships inherently more difficult to keep monogamous than other types, because of the (I'm making a huge assumption based on personal experience here) promiscuity of gay males?

We talk about everything very openly, even if it it&amp;#39;s uncomfortable and we&amp;#39;ve been doing well because of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess what I&amp;#39;m asking is twofold - has anyone been in a situation like this before, and what has you experience been like?  Are gay relationships inherently more difficult to keep monogamous than other types, because of the (I&amp;#39;m making a huge assumption based on personal experience here) promiscuity of gay males?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My thought was to just bring it up with my SO and let him know that this friend proposed this to us and see what he says.&lt;/p&gt;

Just to give you some background, we met in high school when he was still in the closet. I’ve been out since I was in 7th grade because we both grew up in a really liberal college town in the South. He didn’t come out to me until sophomore year in college, and we started dating soon after that. We dated throughout college, while he studied abroad in France for a year, and while I studied abroad in France another semester. I went to school 4 hours away while he went to school in Chapel Hill (our hometown), but we somehow made it work.

I ended up moving back to Raleigh, which is about 30 minutes away from Chapel Hill, for work and to be closer to my family and boyfriend. He worked in a science lab at Dook (proper spelling of Duke), so we saw each other pretty regularly until this past year. He started medical school at UNC, but we both knew it was going to be rough in terms of his availability. I guess we never realized how much of an impact it was going to have on our relationship. It got to a point where I was always yelling at him for not driving to Raleigh as much I was driving to Chapel Hill. I also got frustrated that he would forget that we had dinner plans and make plans with his med school friends. I’m all for him being social outside of our relationship because I’ve learned to live with a long distance boyfriend all those years. It was just frustrating when we would make plans over the weekend to grab dinner during the week, but he’d forget and make other plans. 

The straw that broke the camel’s back happened last week when he asked me to help him move to a new apartment at 2:30 p.m. the same day after I got off work. I changed my dinner plans to help him move. What was frustrating was that I asked him several times when he wanted me to come over to help him move, but he didn’t answer any of my texts or gchat messages the week leading up to when he needed help. We also talked on the phone about other things too, but the topic of moving never came up. I snapped when I got there and he had no plan of how to pack his things. I asked him to delegate tasks out to me and our friend, but he just got overwhelmed with all the stuff he had. His lack of organization spiraled into us having a huge argument, and I ended up driving home after being in Chapel Hill for just an hour. He called me multiple times when I was on the highway until I finally picked up. I yelled at him for not respecting my time and my contributions to the relationship. Examples include:

* Since he started medical school, I always pay for our dinners. I work in PR, so I’m not exactly making bank. I know he’s in school with a lot of debt, but it’d be nice if he paid for our cheap Mexican/fast food outings while I paid for the sushi/tapas dinners.
* It got to a point where we weren’t even going out for dinners anymore. I would just come over and watch Netflix while he studied. He knew the days I would come over, so it would frustrate me that he wouldn’t take advantage of studying when I wasn’t there. He’s an avid procrastinator. 
* I drove to Chapel Hill significantly more than he drives to Raleigh. I know I only work 9-5 and can easily drive to his house after work, but he could at least drive to me on his non-test weekends. His medical school tests were scheduled every other week. I still had to wake up at 6am to go to work when I slept at his place in Chapel Hill. 

I said that I couldn’t do our relationship anymore and hung up on him. I probably should have pulled over to the side of the highway at this point, but I continued driving back to my apartment in Raleigh crying the hardest I’ve cried in a while. 

Come this past Saturday, I had to go to his mother’s wedding. Awkward situation, right? Despite dating for 7 years, he has yet to tell his mother that he is gay or that we are dating. I met his 22 year old brother for the first time at his mother’s wedding. All of his friends and family said would make comments about how nice it was that we stayed friends since high school. “Oh, but we’re more than friends. We’ve actually been sleeping with each other for 7 years now.” I didn’t think it was appropriate at his mother’s wedding.

I went home frustrated and called him over the phone. I officially ended things this past Saturday night. I’ve been on Grinder and Adam4Adam chatting guys up to find a random hookup, but I can never bring myself to actually meet up with them. I know it’s too soon, but I don’t know how to get over my ex-boyfriend. I know it’s not going to happen overnight, but I don’t really know what else to do. I feel like my life is spiraling out of control, and it frustrates me that a relationship can have this much of an impact on my life. 

At first, I wrote this post thinking I was going to pose the question, “would it be bad if I just met up with random guys on the internet?” But I know the answer to the question: yes, it would be bad. Yes, you will feel horrible about yourself. So I’m not really sure why I’m posting this on here. Maybe it’s just to rant and to seek out validation that, “yes, you ARE validated in feeling hurt that your boyfriend doesn’t feel the need to come out to his family and tell them we’ve been dating for 7 years.” Are all relationships this hard? I thought I had a normally functioning relationship until all my friends have recently been like, “yeah, we were wondering why it never bothered you that he wasn’t out to his family…” FUCK. 

Tl;dr – I just broke up with my boyfriend of 7 years, and now I’m an emotional wreck.

We met online, he was only looking for friends. I was looking for more, but told myself I'd respect that and just work on the friendship since we really clicked and have a lot in common.

But now, he's met this girl who he's trying to start a relationship with. He said there's a lot he is terrified of in terms of being with a girl, and I did say he shouldn't push himself into that if it doesn't feel right.
But this is where its complicated. She is going away travelling for 4 months at the end of Aug. So, he mentioned something about the relationship having an end in sight...
I'm finding it really hard to even talk to him or be around him just because of the feelings I have for him. I really want to tell him how I feel, and that he shouldn't push himself to have a girlfriend, but I feel like that is really selfish of me.

It's been a little over a year now and I'm interested in getting back on the saddle.  

It's kinda long but I guess I'll explain my situation and the context and see what you guys have to say. Minor NSFW details enclosed. Tl;dr version below. 

Last Tuesday this guy with only a body picture as his main profile picture messaged me on Grindr, he's my age (26) and he's pretty new in town--only been here for about a month but moved here for work (He's an engineer) we spoke for a while and flirted a lot during that time. On Wednesday he asked me if I wanted to grab lunch, I happily agreed and we met during his lunch break at a Tex-mex place since he works close to where I live.

We had a pretty good hour, spoke a lot about what we do for work, our interested fields of study, etc. Afterward, I felt kinda optimistic since it's been a long while since I found someone I was genuinely interested in getting to know better. Later that evening I asked him if he wanted to do dinner after work since we both seemed to have nothing to do. He agreed and we had a good time and walked around and spoke for a good deal and had a pretty good time. I got a message from him afterward that I was ""a pretty cool guy to hang with"" and I responded mutually to him. Seems like things were going pretty smoothly.

He's not a very expressive text-er, seems to only do so when he wants to make plans or when he's flirting so we didn't speak as much. I didn't really expect to hear from him again but Friday evening he asked if he could come and stay over, since the next day was his day off. **At this point I thought ""I mean it IS Grindr after all so this is likely what he's always wanted"" which was fine with me since it had been a while.** Ultimately I agreed and invited him over to stay the night. 

That's when I found out he lives an hour away from me (living with family until he settles paper work on his condo), **so driving an hour for a booty call seemed a bit odd.** When he finally got here we used my apartment's hot tub and chatted a lot, then he pulled me in close and started kissing me. We did that for a bout 30 minutes mixed in with cuddling and groping. At some point we were interrupted by a group of guys who came to sit around the pool. We decided to leave since PDA makes him uncomfortable. 

Back at my place, we got changed (separately) and cuddled on the sofa and watched two and a half documentaries on tornadoes. After almost falling asleep on the sofa we both got into bed and cuddled for a while. At that point I brushed my hand against his nipple and that seemed to have a pretty intense effect, to the point he started intensely making out with me and climbed on top of me, thrusting and rubbing. I was really into it and it seemed like we were going to have sex, until he asked me ""Are you sure you want to do this? If you keep  touching my chest like that I won't be able to control myself."" **I didn't know how to respond, since on one hand I was REALLY enjoying myself but on the other, I liked him and knew that if we did sleep together I likely wouldn't hear from him again.** 

Before I could respond in that instant, he made the decision for me and climbed off and laid next to me again and started caressing my arm. He made a couple moves like putting my hand on his dick, but then moving it away after 5 minutes. After about 30 minutes it was clear he didn't want to have sex so we fell asleep. 

Saturday morning we both woke up, both groggy. I cuddled with him a bit more, but he expressed that he had to go and made his way to my shower to get ready for the day. Afterward he got his things together he said his goodbyes, gave me a hug and left. **At this point I was feeling a little confused since we spent much of the evening kissing and cuddling and he seemed a bit distant here.** About 30 minutes later I sent him a text and told him that he was good company and that I enjoyed myself, and he responded with a simple ""Thanks, it was fun"" but that wasn't really any different than how he normally responds. The next day I messaged him a funny picture, to which he didn't respond so I decided to leave it alone.

Monday afternoon I decided to text message him and ask him if he wanted to grab lunch, he said that he was really busy, but that dinner would work better instead. **I was relived since I thought I may have done something wrong Friday night.** We met at a small Italian restaurant that I picked out downtown. We chatted a lot about building structures and he talked in length about properly managing a company and told me of his interest in becoming a CEO. After dinner he said he had to go, since he hand errands to run after, and **I began feeling a little dejected since dinner didn't really feel like a date** so to test the waters I told him that he was welcome to spend the night again, and he could leave from my place to work since it was much closer than an hour commute. He told me he'd think about it and confessed that Friday evening moved a lot quicker than he was comfortable with and that it was partly his fault. I agreed that it did move fast and then he changed the subject by getting distracted by something. He then mentioned he was going to go inspect his condo, and I asked if I could see it--since it was fairly close by to where we were and he had spoken about it to me in length prior dates. He agreed and we drove to see it and then spent 30 minutes walking around by the lake downtown afterward. Afterward we said our goodbyes and he reached out to give me a handshake, which I went in for a then bro-hugged him instead. 

Later that evening I asked if he got home okay and if he had time to chat on the phone a bit (just so I could get to know him better). He thanked me for checking in on him but said ""No I'm helping my aunt with her computer. Another time?"" I agreed and asked him to tell me when was best, to which he didn't respond. **I decided to leave it be until I hear from him again. **

So now I'm sitting here Wednesday afternoon wondering where exactly this is going and feeling kind of confused. First date we saw each other twice, second date he drove an hour away to spend the night and NOT have sex, and third date we had a simple dinner and walked around a bit and talked about business. From how he communicates, I can't really tell if he's interested or not. If he really does want to take it slow, then I apparently have no idea what that means thanks to our fast pace gay culture. Would him being not out to his family and being Catholic have anything to do with it?

***Tl;dr I met a handsome and intelligent guy on Grindr and hit it off pretty well. Date one we had both lunch and dinner, date two he drove an hour to see me and stay the night but not have sex, date three we had a very casual dinner and short stroll around town. Despite having three dates I can't tell if he's interested or not. It's clear he wants to take it slow but I don't think I understand that that would normally entail. Am I doing something wrong? It bothers me that I'm unable to follow his intentions or understand his motivations.***

 
 


 

 

","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t really have all that experience with dating, I&amp;#39;ve only been in one relationship prior (met and dated long distance for 2 years before he moved here) and that one lasted close to 5 years before we decided to both mutually break it off. It&amp;#39;s been a little over a year now and I&amp;#39;m interested in getting back on the saddle.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s kinda long but I guess I&amp;#39;ll explain my situation and the context and see what you guys have to say. Minor NSFW details enclosed. Tl;dr version below. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last Tuesday this guy with only a body picture as his main profile picture messaged me on Grindr, he&amp;#39;s my age (26) and he&amp;#39;s pretty new in town--only been here for about a month but moved here for work (He&amp;#39;s an engineer) we spoke for a while and flirted a lot during that time. On Wednesday he asked me if I wanted to grab lunch, I happily agreed and we met during his lunch break at a Tex-mex place since he works close to where I live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a pretty good hour, spoke a lot about what we do for work, our interested fields of study, etc. Afterward, I felt kinda optimistic since it&amp;#39;s been a long while since I found someone I was genuinely interested in getting to know better. Later that evening I asked him if he wanted to do dinner after work since we both seemed to have nothing to do. He agreed and we had a good time and walked around and spoke for a good deal and had a pretty good time. I got a message from him afterward that I was &amp;quot;a pretty cool guy to hang with&amp;quot; and I responded mutually to him. Seems like things were going pretty smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s not a very expressive text-er, seems to only do so when he wants to make plans or when he&amp;#39;s flirting so we didn&amp;#39;t speak as much. I didn&amp;#39;t really expect to hear from him again but Friday evening he asked if he could come and stay over, since the next day was his day off. &lt;strong&gt;At this point I thought &amp;quot;I mean it IS Grindr after all so this is likely what he&amp;#39;s always wanted&amp;quot; which was fine with me since it had been a while.&lt;/strong&gt; Ultimately I agreed and invited him over to stay the night. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s when I found out he lives an hour away from me (living with family until he settles paper work on his condo), &lt;strong&gt;so driving an hour for a booty call seemed a bit odd.&lt;/strong&gt; When he finally got here we used my apartment&amp;#39;s hot tub and chatted a lot, then he pulled me in close and started kissing me. We did that for a bout 30 minutes mixed in with cuddling and groping. At some point we were interrupted by a group of guys who came to sit around the pool. We decided to leave since PDA makes him uncomfortable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back at my place, we got changed (separately) and cuddled on the sofa and watched two and a half documentaries on tornadoes. After almost falling asleep on the sofa we both got into bed and cuddled for a while. At that point I brushed my hand against his nipple and that seemed to have a pretty intense effect, to the point he started intensely making out with me and climbed on top of me, thrusting and rubbing. I was really into it and it seemed like we were going to have sex, until he asked me &amp;quot;Are you sure you want to do this? If you keep  touching my chest like that I won&amp;#39;t be able to control myself.&amp;quot; &lt;strong&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t know how to respond, since on one hand I was REALLY enjoying myself but on the other, I liked him and knew that if we did sleep together I likely wouldn&amp;#39;t hear from him again.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I could respond in that instant, he made the decision for me and climbed off and laid next to me again and started caressing my arm. He made a couple moves like putting my hand on his dick, but then moving it away after 5 minutes. After about 30 minutes it was clear he didn&amp;#39;t want to have sex so we fell asleep. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning we both woke up, both groggy. I cuddled with him a bit more, but he expressed that he had to go and made his way to my shower to get ready for the day. Afterward he got his things together he said his goodbyes, gave me a hug and left. &lt;strong&gt;At this point I was feeling a little confused since we spent much of the evening kissing and cuddling and he seemed a bit distant here.&lt;/strong&gt; About 30 minutes later I sent him a text and told him that he was good company and that I enjoyed myself, and he responded with a simple &amp;quot;Thanks, it was fun&amp;quot; but that wasn&amp;#39;t really any different than how he normally responds. The next day I messaged him a funny picture, to which he didn&amp;#39;t respond so I decided to leave it alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monday afternoon I decided to text message him and ask him if he wanted to grab lunch, he said that he was really busy, but that dinner would work better instead. &lt;strong&gt;I was relived since I thought I may have done something wrong Friday night.&lt;/strong&gt; We met at a small Italian restaurant that I picked out downtown. We chatted a lot about building structures and he talked in length about properly managing a company and told me of his interest in becoming a CEO. After dinner he said he had to go, since he hand errands to run after, and &lt;strong&gt;I began feeling a little dejected since dinner didn&amp;#39;t really feel like a date&lt;/strong&gt; so to test the waters I told him that he was welcome to spend the night again, and he could leave from my place to work since it was much closer than an hour commute. He told me he&amp;#39;d think about it and confessed that Friday evening moved a lot quicker than he was comfortable with and that it was partly his fault. I agreed that it did move fast and then he changed the subject by getting distracted by something. He then mentioned he was going to go inspect his condo, and I asked if I could see it--since it was fairly close by to where we were and he had spoken about it to me in length prior dates. He agreed and we drove to see it and then spent 30 minutes walking around by the lake downtown afterward. Afterward we said our goodbyes and he reached out to give me a handshake, which I went in for a then bro-hugged him instead. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later that evening I asked if he got home okay and if he had time to chat on the phone a bit (just so I could get to know him better). He thanked me for checking in on him but said &amp;quot;No I&amp;#39;m helping my aunt with her computer. Another time?&amp;quot; I agreed and asked him to tell me when was best, to which he didn&amp;#39;t respond. *&lt;em&gt;I decided to leave it be until I hear from him again. *&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now I&amp;#39;m sitting here Wednesday afternoon wondering where exactly this is going and feeling kind of confused. First date we saw each other twice, second date he drove an hour away to spend the night and NOT have sex, and third date we had a simple dinner and walked around a bit and talked about business. From how he communicates, I can&amp;#39;t really tell if he&amp;#39;s interested or not. If he really does want to take it slow, then I apparently have no idea what that means thanks to our fast pace gay culture. Would him being not out to his family and being Catholic have anything to do with it?&lt;/p&gt;
