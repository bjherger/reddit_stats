I knew he liked weed from day one and I had no problem with it. But I didn't know he LOVED the stuff until I was several months deep.  
  
About 2/3 of the time we are together he is high. If we're supposed to meet up at 6 he'll show up at 7 or 8 because the weed man was late (happens all the time). ""If I had the money I would smoke from dusk until dawn"", is something he's said a few times before.
  
His paycheck isn't always predictable. Some months he'll have to borrow money from his sister to pay his bills. He's practically found a second job so that part will probably get better, but I think it's kind strange how his first financial priority is weed. If he does offer to pay when we go out, I usually feel like shit because that'll literally be the last $10 he has because he spent the rest of it on weed.
  
I view weed as the safe cousin of alcohol. It's not going to make you wild and violent. I can totally see why someone would want to smoke a bowl after a long day same way someone might want to unwind with a couple beers. I can also understand why someone would want to get high out of their mind on the weekend just like some people would want to get shit faced drunk on a Friday (we're both under 25).

So I&amp;#39;m newly out and I want to meet/hit on guys like me. I don&amp;#39;t want use any apps or electronic way to meet someone. How do you come up to a guy and hit on them without getting punched in the face? Do I first have to investigate if they are gay or not?

I was a virgin until 22 because I was obese.  I knew I didn't look attractive so just focused on school and myself.

Then I stumbled across some articles online about bodybuilding and weightlifting and lost close to 100 pounds.  I naturally assumed I was into girls and started dating.  I had a few awkward sexual encounters where I would try to have sex with a girl, not be able to stay hard for more than a minute, and then cuddle and talk and apologize.

I do think women are somewhat attractive and I do also think men are attractive.  I just think some are more attractive than others.  However, I definitely am more attracted to the male persona emotionally.  I view myself as somewhat submissive and feminine (even though I now am pretty muscular and can lift over 300 pounds in a lot of exercises lol).

I watch both gay porn and straight porn, but have recently watched some gay YouTubers in relationships and have thought ""I want that.""

I'm still really confused as to my sexuality and don't necessarily think distinct labels are necessary.  I also think my delay in discovering my sexuality due to my weight has me in a very new situation.

We got to talking, exchanged phone numbers, started hanging out. Personality-wise, we mesh really well, but, there's a physical problem. We're both about 6 feet tall, but I'm ~145 lbs, and he's ~330 lbs. 

Initially I was turned on by this. *Very* turned on by it. But, in practice, things are...different. We haven't had sex, but he did end up staying at my place overnight, so we had an evening of cuddling (impromptu, and I didn't have supplies with me, so no sex). 

From this, I learned that I really can't handle his weight. When we hug, I can't even fit my arms around him, let alone squeeze, which is something I'd really like to be able to do (he couldn't even tell that I was trying to squeeze). We tried a number of almost-sex positions, and couldn't get comfortable in any of them, again, because of his size. Cuddling is even difficult, and we could never really find a position both of us were comfortable in. I got about 20 minutes of sleep the night he stayed over, he got significantly more. 

He stayed over Thursday night, and then we both went about our days on Friday, with plans to meet up at his place on Friday for sex, with me kinda hoping that I could get past the weight issue, given that there's no other problems. 

But, late Friday morning, I got an insanely bad headache, that hasn't gone away yet. Bad enough that sex certainly wasn't an option, and when my head hurts, I don't even want anyone to touch me or even be near me, really. I told him what was going on, he understood, and we agreed to get back together when I felt better. 

As each day passes by, I'm more and more sure that a physical relationship between us isn't going to work out. I'm pretty far from shallow, but I can't really handle the significant differences. 
____

So, on to the meat of the problem. I'd like to tell him that a physical relationship isn't really in the cards between us, but I'd also like to maintain him as a friend, since we got along so well and I don't really have much by way of friends. But I'm not sure how to go about this without coming off as a massive asshole and having him hate me. And, furthermore, I'm afraid that he'll think that my headache was an excuse to cover for me having second thoughts about us having sex, which it wasn't. 

Anyone ever been in a situation like this, on either end? How did it go? What advice, if any, can you give me?

I really hope that there's a way I can keep him as a friend, and that I just haven't thought of it yet.

&lt;p&gt;Long story turned question: Is it wrong to look up someone you POLITELY ignored before simply because you were in a relationship, now that you&amp;#39;re not. Never actually talked to the guy either. He seemed somewhat shy.&lt;/p&gt;

I posted this on r/relationship_advice but thought I would post it in a gay community. I honestly don't know where else to go for advice. 

My boyfriend and I have been dating for a while, since October. We've already had some problems with infidelity during the first week of our relationship, but we have both been working really hard to make our relationship better. But something happened last night that I cannot explain. 

His birthday was on Tuesday (the 24th) so he went out last night (Friday the 27th), unbeknownst to me, to celebrate with his cousin. I went to my local comedy club after I got off work and then went to my friends house to hang out and have a few drinks. I texted him my friends address in case he wanted to come over and he calls me already super drunk. He says he is coming over and I ask who's driving. His drunk cousin was driving. I was terrified and told him to call a cab instead. Well, thankfully, he made it safely to my house, where he had just recently moved out of for his own apartment with the same cousin. I told him to just stay there and go to sleep.

About 20 mins later he shows up at my friends house. He had driven himself to my friends house while he was drunk. I was visibly upset but also relieved that he had not been injured. We hang out for a bit longer and he proceeds to get more drunk against my request that he not drink any more. I had 2 drinks the whole night and was sober by the end of the ""party."" 

I had to take one of my friends home so I told my boyfriend that I would drive him. He said he would just drive himself but I said no and made him get in my car so I could get him home safely. The whole way home he was calling me bad names and telling me I was stupid for not letting him drive his car while he was drunk. This behavior is unusual for him, but I just brushed it off my shoulder and chalked it up to him being drunk and out of his senses.

We got home and I got us ready for bed and he asked me to lay with him, which I did. He started to try and kiss me and makeout with me but it was past 330am so I just wanted to go to sleep. I told him that I didn't want to have sex and he continued trying to grab my crotch and get me to touch him sexually. I told him again that I didn't want to do anything and he started getting a little upset. I started to get a little upset as well because he was not listening to me and not respecting the fact that I didn't want to have sex. He called me a douche bag and an asshole because I wouldn't have sex with him, so I grabbed a pillow and my throw blanket and got out of bed.

Or tried to anyway. He grabbed my wrist and told me to get my ass back in bed. I yanked my wrist out of his hand and went to my living room to sleep on the couch. He was yelling at me from my bedroom to fucking come back to bed and to get my ass back in bed. Ten minutes later he comes out crying and asking me to lay with him, telling me that he only wants me to lay with him, which was not true because I can normally cuddle with him without it turning sexual, but tonight everytime I tried ""laying"" with him he would proceed to try and get me to have sex with him. 

I told him I was upset with him because I had been trying my best to make sure he was safe and taken care of tonight and that he was disrespecting me and being rude. I told him if he apologized I would come to bed with him. He didn't. He sat on the floor for like 10 minutes just mumbling and calling me names under his breath. I eventually just got sick of hearing it so I got up and went to the bathroom and locked the door to try and just get a little peace.

He ended up back in my bed and I came in and turned on the lights and asked him if he was going to respect me and not be rude. He told me to turn off the lights and he would. I turned off the lights and laid down with him. He again, tried feeling me up and I grabbed his arms and told him to stop. I got up and put on pajama pants and shirt to prevent...""temptation,"" I guess. He called me an ass and I laid down with my back to him. It was about 6 AM by the time I finally fell asleep. 

We woke up at 10 to a call from his sister who he had made plans with to have breakfast at his apartment. He asked his sister to come pick him up at my house. He proceeded to lay back down and told me he was still drunk, which I believed because he tried to have sex with me again. I tried to stop him, grabbing his arms, telling him to stop, etc., but he was persistent. So I got up and said I'm going to the bathroom. 

I locked the door. I sat down on the toilet, not knowing what to do and I get a call from my mom. Now, my mom and I are pretty close, distance wise and emotionally. I started to tell her the events of last night and broke down in tears as I realized what had happened that night. My mom is like freaking out and I'm just crying trying to explain what happened.

My boyfriend knocks on the door and asks if he could come in and I didn't want to deal with him at that point so I told him to go away. He did not even remember anything that happened and he was still saying, ""Oh, I just wanted to lay with you and you were being a dick about it and not laying with me."" I broke and yelled at him saying that was bullshit and that he had been trying to just fuck me the whole time. He continues to get more upset and tells me that I'm overreacting and that I'm just being stupid and that I should let him in so we could talk. I did not let him in and he starts trying to open the door and starts banging to let me in. I was so scared. All the while my mom heard this over the phone and told me she would be at my house soon along with my dad. 

My boyfriend gave up eventually and I heard his sister honk in the driveway. He wanted me to open up so he could hug me before he left but there was no way in hell I was going to do that. He called me a dick one last time before everything got quiet. 

I texted my roommate and asked him to check if my boyfriend was still in the house. He came upstairs at the same time my mom got to my house. I packed up all my essentials and school stuff and am now staying at my parents house for the time being. 

I have texted him and told him that the next time he is at my house he should pick up his remaining items and leave his key to my house on the counter. I haven't heard back from him since.

If this was a normal occurrence there is no way I would still be with him, but that's the thing, this came out of nowhere. He has NEVER treated me like that before. He has always been loving and kind and treats my decisions, however financially dumb, with respect and support.  I know he loves me, he tells me that I am the boyriend who has treated him the best and I love him as well, which is why I am so confused. He and I have gotten drunk together and he has never acted like he did last night. 

I don't know what to do. I care very much for him and want to make sure he is okay, but I also don't want to fear for my safety. Is there possibly something else that is going on that I'm missing? Did I do something to cause him to be so angry? Should I break it off? I don't want to, but if my relationship is going to be abusive I also don't want to stay in it. Please, if there is something I can do, let me know. If you have any questions I'll do my best to answer them.

Sorry for the long wall of text

He proceeded to lay back down and told me he was still drunk, which I believed because he tried to have sex with me again. I tried to stop him, grabbing his arms, telling him to stop, etc., but he was persistent. So I got up and said I&amp;#39;m going to the bathroom. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I locked the door. I sat down on the toilet, not knowing what to do and I get a call from my mom. Now, my mom and I are pretty close, distance wise and emotionally. I started to tell her the events of last night and broke down in tears as I realized what had happened that night. My mom is like freaking out and I&amp;#39;m just crying trying to explain what happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My boyfriend knocks on the door and asks if he could come in and I didn&amp;#39;t want to deal with him at that point so I told him to go away. He did not even remember anything that happened and he was still saying, &amp;quot;Oh, I just wanted to lay with you and you were being a dick about it and not laying with me.&amp;quot; I broke and yelled at him saying that was bullshit and that he had been trying to just fuck me the whole time. He continues to get more upset and tells me that I&amp;#39;m overreacting and that I&amp;#39;m just being stupid and that I should let him in so we could talk. I did not let him in and he starts trying to open the door and starts banging to let me in. I was so scared. All the while my mom heard this over the phone and told me she would be at my house soon along with my dad. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My boyfriend gave up eventually and I heard his sister honk in the driveway. He wanted me to open up so he could hug me before he left but there was no way in hell I was going to do that. He called me a dick one last time before everything got quiet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I texted my roommate and asked him to check if my boyfriend was still in the house. He came upstairs at the same time my mom got to my house. I packed up all my essentials and school stuff and am now staying at my parents house for the time being. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have texted him and told him that the next time he is at my house he should pick up his remaining items and leave his key to my house on the counter. I haven&amp;#39;t heard back from him since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this was a normal occurrence there is no way I would still be with him, but that&amp;#39;s the thing, this came out of nowhere. He has NEVER treated me like that before. He has always been loving and kind and treats my decisions, however financially dumb, with respect and support.  I know he loves me, he tells me that I am the boyriend who has treated him the best and I love him as well, which is why I am so confused. He and I have gotten drunk together and he has never acted like he did last night. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know what to do. I care very much for him and want to make sure he is okay, but I also don&amp;#39;t want to fear for my safety. Is there possibly something else that is going on that I&amp;#39;m missing? Did I do something to cause him to be so angry? Should I break it off? I don&amp;#39;t want to, but if my relationship is going to be abusive I also don&amp;#39;t want to stay in it. Please, if there is something I can do, let me know. If you have any questions I&amp;#39;ll do my best to answer them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the long wall of text&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR Boyfriend got drunk last night and tried to force me to have sex with him. When I didn&amp;#39;t he got angry and yelled. Ended up locking myself in the bathroom until he left and my parents picked me up.&lt;/p&gt;

I wanted to come back to you guys after the advice you all gave me and let you know how things have gotten on...

1) I am now openly out as Bisexual to the entire world minus family of course. Surprising, and cliché-ly, everyone was supercool and completely understanding. Of course you get the popular jock types thinking you're gay automatically but nevertheless better than expected.

2) On Day 1 I explained how me and my ""brother"" called off our friendship. Shortly after those posts I learned that brotherhood is not to be taken lightly and blood relations (fake or not) can't be severed that easily. Lots of shit has gone down over the months but we are always there for each other and have met up consistently since. Without him I would be nowhere &lt;3...
PS: I also now have a sister who is a girl-favouring bisexual and we are literally the gayest non-twat people in the school xD

--That covers ""gay"" and ""bros"" so the rest is *slightly* off topic from here on out--

3) ANXIETY IS GONE! FUCK YOU ANXIETY! In all seriousness the anxiety came back to bite me in the ass at the start of this year but it's gone for good now and I can be my normal unstressing, entertaining self again and I couldn't be happier on how far I've come.

4) Mentioned it a little up there ^^ but stress is much less of a worry now. GSCEs are 2 months away but I'm on track and keeping cool :D

5) This one's for all you who helped when my friends ""backstabbed"" me. As it always is with these things, I was the one in the wrong so I did what only my bro could convince me to do - change. It took a while and a lot of (god I hate this word) **self-discovery** but 5 months on and 5 bracket-points later, I feel like a much nicer, welcomed and generally happier person. It was honestly partly down to you /r/askgaybros that I realised a change was necessary and specifically a thanks goes to /u/dcjosh , /u/Invisible96 and ESPECIALLY /u/funchords for being a kindred spirit with needed advice :)

This is not the first time they have said this to each other either.

I am a 20 year old college student who is completely in love with a 25 year old guy on my course. The situation that I am in at the moment is so bad that I fear it has been affecting my mental health. As a desperate last resort, I find myself on this sub-reddit. I hope someone can help me. This will be quite a long post, so I hope you have the patience for it.

I am currently in my second year of college. There are only around 40 people in my course, so everyone more or less knows everybody else. I am studying theatre- the course is very practical, and we spend a lot of time around each other. There is a boy, I'll call him Tom, who I am absolutely in love with.

I did not find out that Tom was gay until February of last year. Most people just assume he is straight. I didn't really have any reaction to it, but as time went on and we became closer, I slowly began to like him.

On the last day of our first college year, we both went to a party and we hooked up. We did not have sex, but we did everything else. The next day, I messaged him on Facebook and I told him that I liked him. 

He never replied. 

I went to the USA for the entire Summer, and he was always in the back of my mind. However, we had no contact at all during this period. 

Flash forward to September and we see each other again. It wass initially awkward, and we kind of ignored each other. As time goes on though, we slowly started talking again. By October, we are at least able to speak to one another again. 

At this time, he is seeing a guy outside of college. They have went on a few dates, and he really likes him. Apparently the guy doesn't feel the same way about Tom. He comes to me looking for advice on what he should do. I give him some solid advice, all the while fighting to hold back tears. I cannot believe that he would ask me, the person who confessed his love to him, for advice- of all people.

Today, I have got to a point where I am reminded by how much I like him- after all I have to see him everyday. We sometimes text and message on Facebook, and he even calls me sometimes to ask if I am going out for a drink, and what my plans are for the evening.

I found out a while back that Tom had sex with a guy called Mark. He got with him at a pride parade during the Summer. Coincidentally, Mark is now a first year student on my course. 

At a house party a while before Christmas, I got with Mark. Tom does not know this. I don't think he would be upset at this situation: he comes across as a player, but I know if he finds out he will sleep with Mark to hurt me. The first and the second years do not work together, but they start to near the end of the academic year, so this will probably happen. My heart is breaking at the thought of it, I can only imagine what it will be like if it actually happens.

I should probably point out that Tom is not out of the closet to his parents. At a house party recently, he kissed a girl. Again, I was heartbroken. It hurt because for a brief moment, I thought I had gotten over him, but apparently not. I don't think he is bisexual, but I do think he is in denial about his homosexuality.

He consistently flirts with me, though. At first I didn't want to tell my friends this - they are aware of everything that has happened and I thought they might think I was being delusional. But they have repeatedly pointed out to me on numerous occasions that he is actively flirting with and teasing me.

I am letting my happiness be defined by him. I am letting my self worth be defined by him. The worst thing about it is that I know I am doing it. I will change my plans so I can see him. I think about him all the time, and it hurts so bad. I know he doesn't like me, so why is he leading me on? He has to be aware that he is doing it- he is in no way stupid. If he is aware of it though, that just means he is a dick. I don't think that that he. 

I cannot tell him how I feel, because I am afraid of losing his friendship. What can I do?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone.

It's interfering with my sex life (obviously) and my sense of self worth. If anyone has any advice (or words of encouragement) they would be much appreciated. This has been a hellish few months and I really just want it all to be over.

UPDATE: Thanks everyone for the support/advice, really appreciate it. I guess I posted in /r/askgaybros because I'm worried I'll never be able to have anal again. I think my doctor finds the conversation awkward so I've had issues getting a straight (no pun intended) answer out of him. Have any of you dealt with this and recovered? What was it like bottoming after/how long did you have to wait?

I think I'll be having the next procedure this week. The plan is to suture in a draining tube for 2 weeks to a month and then do an MRI to be sure the abscess cavity has collapsed before removing it.

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s interfering with my sex life (obviously) and my sense of self worth. If anyone has any advice (or words of encouragement) they would be much appreciated. This has been a hellish few months and I really just want it all to be over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: Thanks everyone for the support/advice, really appreciate it. I guess I posted in &lt;a href=""/r/askgaybros""&gt;/r/askgaybros&lt;/a&gt; because I&amp;#39;m worried I&amp;#39;ll never be able to have anal again. I think my doctor finds the conversation awkward so I&amp;#39;ve had issues getting a straight (no pun intended) answer out of him. Have any of you dealt with this and recovered? What was it like bottoming after/how long did you have to wait?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I&amp;#39;ll be having the next procedure this week. The plan is to suture in a draining tube for 2 weeks to a month and then do an MRI to be sure the abscess cavity has collapsed before removing it. &lt;/p&gt;

I'm thinking about spending part of it at one of the Fort Lauderdale clothing optional resorts. Has anyone ever been?

I'm not really looking to hook up or anything like that; but just decompress as much as a I can and do as little as possible in a relaxed environment. I want to go alone and I kind of just want to be naked. These seem like a good option. 

Most of the reviews on traveling sites are kind of vanilla and not very detailed. Any experiences, preferences, or general tips?

So I recently starting date a really cute guy, he's really lovely, we get along great, lots of similar interests. (I'm 24, he's 1 week short of 30)

We had sex for the first time today, nothing anal yet but a lot of making out and oral fun. Now I assumed as much from feeling it through his pants but he's probably around 4.5"", I'm around 6.5"", he's also slightly uhm... misshaped? He has a decent sized head but the shaft is smaller. Now I'm not saying this in a bad way, the problem is I had trouble getting really uhm... onto it with both my hand and my mouth to try and give him a really great blowjob.

Does anyone have any tips to help me please him?

On top of this, I'm versatile but I think he'll probably want me to top him (we haven't truly discussed it but I believe he's a bottom), but at some point in time I do want him to top for me. Do you think his size will be an issue at all or will it be fine and I'm just a bit worried, he's basically the first relationship I've had and I've made out with a couple of guys before but nothing really serious before now.

Last question, after I found a really good position, I managed to get him to come pretty hard using my tongue on his head, he has a really sensitive head apparently ^.~ ANYWAY I uhm... maybe gagged just as he came and ended up basically gagging out his come instead of swallowing like he did for me and I felt awkward, he was able to basically take all of me inside his mouth/throat and work it fine but I guess I have a sensitive gag reflex as I was having trouble, any hints for this?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi friends,&lt;/p&gt;
