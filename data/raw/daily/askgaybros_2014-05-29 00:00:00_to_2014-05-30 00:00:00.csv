Going to change up the breakup topics (even though I am going through one and it is horrible. Hang in there! Maybe this is why I am having all these thoughts..)

I was wondering if anyone has ever been in my situation. I am 24 with a full-time job at one of the biggest radio stations in the united states. So, nice name but I hate it. I don't want to work with this concept anymore because I just generally don't care about the work whatsoever. I really want to get into nutrition and maybe even be a dietitian. I actually love making meal plans for myself, read medical journals, stay up-to-date on current events in the nutrition community, and volunteer in this setting. I fucking love it. 

Having said that - I would be done with school at 29-30 realistically   if I went to become a dietitian. This means from 24-30 I basically would have no steady income because I could not juggle a full-time job with grad school, I know my limit and it just wouldn't be productive. I would end up with a bunch of loans, I live in NYC with a year lease, and in the dietitian program you need to take an internship that you must pay for and they hit at about $8000. Starting salary for this field is only $50,000 after all of this. 

Oh, yeah my degree is in Business Communications so starting from scratch with science classes. Should I look for nutrition marketing jobs? I really don't even think I would enjoy being a suit at marketing firm though. Some kind of communications with nutrition? That just seems like I would need a degree to do that because why hire the person with a non-specified degree for that field?

The 20s are some confusing shit.

Background: I've been talking to this guy on Hornet for a few days and we met up tonight. It went pretty terribly for me. I'm a shy person and I thought it was just going to be us (which I can obviously handle) but surprise 3 of his friends are there too. He spoke to them in Spanish the whole time and didn't include me at all (live in Australia), he smoked in my face (hate smokers) and he was 20 mins late. 

So when I get home I see a text from him saying that we should get together again some time. I thought that was funny and was just going to ignore him like I usually do with my bad dates but I was feeling annoyed at the whole situation so I told him to suck my dick. 

He thought I was kidding and said he's going to bed but we should meet up again sometime. I said really, you wanna meet up again after I didn't talk the whole time and just told you to suck my dick?

Then he went and said sorry he realises he probably shouldn't have made me go out with his friends when he knew I'm shy. I should have left it there but I just kept going. 

""you were 20 minutes late. you smoked in my face. I told you I'm shy and you made me sit with your friends. you didn't include me in the conversation at all. I just told you to suck my dick. and you want to meet up with me again?""

he said he's sorry he ever asked me out in the first place. That was when I realised how much of an absolute arsehole I was being. I'm leaving it for now but I feel I should apologise to him tomorrow morning. I don't know what to say though. I've never been such a dick to someone in my life. Obviously I don't want to meet up with him again because we are super incompatible and stuff but I can't just be that much of a dick to someone and not apologise can I?

I am 22, recently graduated and living in Seattle, and just got out of a year long relationship with my 20 year old ex. The break-up was fine until last night-3 weeks after-when he revealed some unsettling information. (See bold below)

I am just hoping to get some tips and tricks for getting over my relationship. I have tendency to get lost in the lonelyness post-break up and in the past that has rolled into a bad depression.  

I have already started running and I cycle 20 miles to and from work every day.

Here is a quick and rough summary of the facts:

* We met through okcupid. He was extremely cute, but very naive. I was his first serious relationship and helped him get started into community college.
* During our relationship we got *really* kinky. I mean we basically did everything
* He has issues standing up for himself and consistenly would tell me what I wanted to hear.
* Had a conversation with him last night over skype chat were he claims to have started crying as both say we ""love"" each other. I started talking about doing an open relationship. He considered it deeply, but decided that it would be better to date this guy he met a week ago. 

**The hard part:** It has been three weeks since the break-up. He apparently made an account on fetlife, hooked up with some guy, and posted the pictures on there. While we were kinky, this completely caught me off guard, and this is completely out of the realm of what I though he would do. I gag everytime I think of those pictures and they are etched in my mind.

I am worried about him in the following ways:

* Ruining his image

* Getting sometype of disease

* Dropping out of college (He is really smart and has lots of potential)

If you have advice please give it. I am not one for writing such posts so I apologize if this seems patched together.

I'm worried this is going to come across as another ""falling for a straight guy"" story but I just need to get this all off my chest, so here goes. 

I had started to develop feelings for a close friend a few months back. It didn't seem like it was going to be an issue and I figured it would pass. But then one day he and I were talking about our love lives and I mentioned offhand that I had feelings for someone but it wasn't worth pursuing because they wouldn't reciprocate. He responded by saying it's best to be honest and that if I was close enough to this person it shouldn't make a difference. After thinking about it for a few days, I decided to let him know how I felt about him. He responded with ""yeah, I know. You're still one of my closest friends and I still care about you."" But then things started to change. Immediately after I told him, we went from hanging out every day to hardly seeing each other. His girlfriend started being, at least from my perspective, passively hostile towards me. He and I would talk every now and then, but it was never more than a superficial ""hey how's it going"" type conversation. I figured he just needed some space and that things would get better over time. After a month or so, we started hanging out again, usually with a group of our other friends around, but things between the two of us were still a little strained. 

Then there was one night when a large group of us were hanging out and as he walked by me, he accidentally bumped into me and spilled my drink. I got up to get paper towels to clean it up and when I came back he had taken my seat, which isn't super cool. I asked him to help me, and I may have been a little more insistent than necessary, but even some of the other people there agreed that it was kind of a dick move. His response was to storm off to the kitchen of the fairly small apartment and complain about me to whomever would listen. I could hear pretty much everything he was saying, as could most of the other people there, but I could only carry on and pretend I didn't hear any of it. The thing that gets me is that he complained that I was acting different and that I was ignoring the issue, even though he was the one who started acting differently. A day or two later, I texted him and asked if we could talk so we could work it all out and his response was ""maybe tomorrow""... which was also his response for the next four days in a row before eventually saying ""yeah I'm busy til next week."" Now he just pretends I don't exist, even when we end up in the same place because of mutual friends. At the recommendation of a friend of mine, I sent him one last text saying ""hey I'd still really like to talk to you. If you're interested it'd be cool if you could tell me when you're free and if not I understand"" and I haven't heard back from him since. 

When he's around I shut down. I feel like a different person. I go from being fun and outgoing to quiet and reserved just because the mere sight of him makes me feel so ashamed. I just wish we could go back to being friends and I'm worried that'll never happen at this point. I feel stuck. I'm worried I've blown this all out of proportion and I honestly don't know what to do. Maybe it's best just to move on, but I don't want to give up on my friend, because I still care about him. Just needed to get that off my chest, I guess.

**tl;dr:** I fucked things up by telling my friend I had feelings for him and I'm not sure where to go from here.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning&lt;/strong&gt;: Long, uninteresting rant ahead. I&amp;#39;m worried this is going to come across as another &amp;quot;falling for a straight guy&amp;quot; story but I just need to get this all off my chest, so here goes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had started to develop feelings for a close friend a few months back. It didn&amp;#39;t seem like it was going to be an issue and I figured it would pass. But then one day he and I were talking about our love lives and I mentioned offhand that I had feelings for someone but it wasn&amp;#39;t worth pursuing because they wouldn&amp;#39;t reciprocate. He responded by saying it&amp;#39;s best to be honest and that if I was close enough to this person it shouldn&amp;#39;t make a difference. After thinking about it for a few days, I decided to let him know how I felt about him. He responded with &amp;quot;yeah, I know. You&amp;#39;re still one of my closest friends and I still care about you.&amp;quot; But then things started to change. Immediately after I told him, we went from hanging out every day to hardly seeing each other. His girlfriend started being, at least from my perspective, passively hostile towards me. He and I would talk every now and then, but it was never more than a superficial &amp;quot;hey how&amp;#39;s it going&amp;quot; type conversation. I figured he just needed some space and that things would get better over time. After a month or so, we started hanging out again, usually with a group of our other friends around, but things between the two of us were still a little strained. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there was one night when a large group of us were hanging out and as he walked by me, he accidentally bumped into me and spilled my drink. I got up to get paper towels to clean it up and when I came back he had taken my seat, which isn&amp;#39;t super cool. I asked him to help me, and I may have been a little more insistent than necessary, but even some of the other people there agreed that it was kind of a dick move. His response was to storm off to the kitchen of the fairly small apartment and complain about me to whomever would listen. I could hear pretty much everything he was saying, as could most of the other people there, but I could only carry on and pretend I didn&amp;#39;t hear any of it. The thing that gets me is that he complained that I was acting different and that I was ignoring the issue, even though he was the one who started acting differently. A day or two later, I texted him and asked if we could talk so we could work it all out and his response was &amp;quot;maybe tomorrow&amp;quot;... which was also his response for the next four days in a row before eventually saying &amp;quot;yeah I&amp;#39;m busy til next week.&amp;quot; Now he just pretends I don&amp;#39;t exist, even when we end up in the same place because of mutual friends. At the recommendation of a friend of mine, I sent him one last text saying &amp;quot;hey I&amp;#39;d still really like to talk to you. If you&amp;#39;re interested it&amp;#39;d be cool if you could tell me when you&amp;#39;re free and if not I understand&amp;quot; and I haven&amp;#39;t heard back from him since. &lt;/p&gt;

A few weeks ago I asked what he was looking for and he said ""dating, friends or relationship"". Ever since, we have Been going out on dates for just over two months now and we have been hitting it of quite well. We snapchat each other a lot and message each other every day. He's messaged me sometimes saying how he wants me to come cuddle him etc.
The other night after our dinner date we went and got dessert. When having our ice cream I asked him since we had been seeing each other for a while now, where did he see this all going or where did he want to see it go. He said he'll see what will happen with time and asked me where I wanted it to go. I answered saying i would like it to lead to a relationship. After that he was a bit awkward and quiet in the moment so I asked if he was dating anyone else and he said no. After that he then said he is new to all this relationship stuff as he's never been in one so he doesn't know how it works or what he's doing.

I messaged him the following day and said sorry if I weirded him out and he said I did freak him out quite a bit

I asked my friend if I did the right thing by asking him since we've been on quite a few dates now and my friend said I did the right thing by asking him, and my friend believe since he is not out yet to everyone (including his parents) or never been with anyone before he is quite shy and timid and still finding himself so he may feel insecure about the idea of heading into a relationship as it could take months for him to feel comfortable about it

I came here for a friendly opinion about my problem. English isn't my first language, so I apologize for bad grammar.

I am 25 years old now and realized I'm gay only recently. You see, I lived in an extremely homophobic environment with majority of my acquaintances being extremly anti-gay (for example: my classmates in college adhered to the idea that gay people should be put in prison or mental institutions). It took me a decade to realize, that the fact that i'm mastrubating to male porn, or daydreaming that a guy is penetrating me, or initiating a game of truth or dare during an all-male party while being drunk and making all the guys undress and kiss each other, getting a biggest hard on while kissing a guy... Well, after all of this I was really 100% sure I was straight for quite a long time. The reason, I think, was insecurity, because being gay was humiliating to me back then, I cared about what other people think too much, and had really toxic people around me.

So, today I face several dilemmas, I have no gay friends, or friends who know gay people, I figured out that dating sites are my best choice, because I don't want only sex, I want relationships, I want to be able to walk holding hands, to be naughty and playful with my bf, you know all that stuff that makes you feel good for no logical reason... I think I sound so stupid right now, sorry. Also, I am not attractive, my face is pretty average (pics: http://imgur.com/a/taXup), my body is in a pretty bad shape from my sediatary lifestyle, I started visiting gym half a year ago and got way better, but still far from acceptable (pics: http://imgur.com/6Pu4WP9 http://imgur.com/GQb1lME).

But, now, he's the one encountering some issues, and I feel like he's pushing me back as if he doesn't want or respect my emotional help. It feels like, because I'm the one who needed him for the 1st 7 months, he doesn't really think I'm in a position to help him. I really hate to see him hurting, and I really want to help. But when I do, he pushes back and it kinda makes me feel like crap. He's done so much for me, and it sucks that all I can do is give him his space for his issues.
