Even things that i dont really care about or would never need to know, i tend to really want to find out, even if just for the sake of it.

The gay culture has always held a ""special"" spot in my mind - all those ""secrets"" and rumors and tinfoil hats and stereotypes, so much stuff to be curious about! I've found out a thing here, a thing there, but there is still a lot of stuff id love to find out.

So i was wondering - does anyone know of some kind of resource (website, forum, book, subreddit post) that would give a kind of a list of ""ask a gay person anything"" things - things that you would normally not ask of someone yourself due to social norms etc. 

Hopefully someone here would be able to satisfy my curiosity :)

Right now I'm between the MacBook Pro (I'm forgoing the opportunity to refer to it as a macbook ""bro"") and the MacBook Pro w/ Retina Display. The basic pro has 4 gb of ram and a 500 gb hardrive while the Pro w/ RD has 8 gb of ram and a 128 gb ssd. I'm not much of a computer gamer.

I'll primarily use the computer for general use, school, porn, excel, netflix, and music (maybe some messing around with minor video editing, not really though).

It's such a weird situation and I really need help. I've been entering periods of depression, which is really unhealthy because I'm a genuinely positive person most of the time!

THE STORY: Me and my boyfriend met at uni in London about 2 years ago. Our relationship was probably the best thing that's ever happened to me. It's hard to find love and romance in the gay scene, sometimes. But my boyfriend and I were perfect together. We both did theatre, we had the same friends, we spent a lot of time together. In the two years that we were together, we went to Paris, Milan, Venice and Edinburgh. I love him and he loved me and although we got into some petty arguments once in a while, I really think that we were made for each other because we bring out each others strengths.

Five months ago, I realised that I had to move back to my own country in Asia because I didn't get a job I wanted. My country is about 7000 miles away from London. When the news hit, I remember him crying immediately and I hugged him to console him. I was going to be in Asia for quite a long while (3 - 5 years) and we both knew that doing long distance for that long a time was just going to be difficult and sad. So although we knew our relationship was perfect, we both decided that we would end things the day I left.

In the last five months we had together, things only got better. We stopped fighting, sex was amazing, we travelled more and spent every day together. We practically lived together and we only started growing more and more dependent of each other. I started to appreciate every part of him and I think we discovered true love.

The day I left was probably the most traumatic thing that I've been through in my life. Kissing him for the last time was awful, I had to stay strong and tell him it'd be okay but inside, I was dying. I tried to say that I'd be back in three years (I'd try to find a definite means of returning) and I'd come back for him. But he just cried in response. He didn't like talking about the future.

Now, I'm in Asia and whenever we Skype, we say 'I love you' and we act like we're in a normal relationship which is very difficult for me because I don't know where we stand. I really love him and I know he really loves me. In fact, he has always been a little bit more dependent on me than I was on him. The thing is, now, when he doesn't reply (he's busy with classes and I'm free), I get really anxious and for the first time I feel insecure about our relationship. We both know that we have to move on and I think we both expect these romantic online sessions to slowly fade away but something in me really believes that we were meant to be and that when I return, we'll be together. Am I being stupid??

How do I move on? I love him and I will always love him but I need to stop being dependent on him? Is it healthy to hope that there is a chance of reconcilement in the future? It's so hard because things ended so well. How can such intense love just fade away and disappear just like that?
He has had to go to the hospital because he feels breathless because he's so emotionally drained by all of this. What do you suggest I do?

Break up and never talk? (I'd hate that! I'd die!) Stay friends and not maintain a relationship? (that's too hard as well) My suggestion to myself is to stay friends and see what happens in three years (but how do I stop being so insecure and dependent on him?) HELP ME. I'm crying all the time.

Love you guys!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh dear. It&amp;#39;s such a weird situation and I really need help. I&amp;#39;ve been entering periods of depression, which is really unhealthy because I&amp;#39;m a genuinely positive person most of the time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE STORY: Me and my boyfriend met at uni in London about 2 years ago. Our relationship was probably the best thing that&amp;#39;s ever happened to me. It&amp;#39;s hard to find love and romance in the gay scene, sometimes. But my boyfriend and I were perfect together. We both did theatre, we had the same friends, we spent a lot of time together. In the two years that we were together, we went to Paris, Milan, Venice and Edinburgh. I love him and he loved me and although we got into some petty arguments once in a while, I really think that we were made for each other because we bring out each others strengths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five months ago, I realised that I had to move back to my own country in Asia because I didn&amp;#39;t get a job I wanted. My country is about 7000 miles away from London. When the news hit, I remember him crying immediately and I hugged him to console him. I was going to be in Asia for quite a long while (3 - 5 years) and we both knew that doing long distance for that long a time was just going to be difficult and sad. So although we knew our relationship was perfect, we both decided that we would end things the day I left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last five months we had together, things only got better. We stopped fighting, sex was amazing, we travelled more and spent every day together. We practically lived together and we only started growing more and more dependent of each other. I started to appreciate every part of him and I think we discovered true love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day I left was probably the most traumatic thing that I&amp;#39;ve been through in my life. Kissing him for the last time was awful, I had to stay strong and tell him it&amp;#39;d be okay but inside, I was dying. I tried to say that I&amp;#39;d be back in three years (I&amp;#39;d try to find a definite means of returning) and I&amp;#39;d come back for him. But he just cried in response. He didn&amp;#39;t like talking about the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I&amp;#39;m in Asia and whenever we Skype, we say &amp;#39;I love you&amp;#39; and we act like we&amp;#39;re in a normal relationship which is very difficult for me because I don&amp;#39;t know where we stand.

&lt;p&gt;How do I move on? I love him and I will always love him but I need to stop being dependent on him? Is it healthy to hope that there is a chance of reconcilement in the future?

I met this guy via grindr (tale as old as time, right?) and we've gone out quite a bit in a short amount of time.  He just talked to me then we switched to texting.  No sending of nudes or dirty messages, just talking about who we are.  He wants a relationship with a guy and so do I.  In person, no sex has happened.  We've kissed, made out a bit, touched through clothes, cuddled in bed, but we haven't gone further.  We're not coy about it either, we've had hard-ons with each other and felt it and said so.  So we have a sexual attraction as well as just being attracted as people.  He's honestly just a really sweet guy and I really like him.  I think we both just kind of want to wait and make it really intense.

Only thing that bothers me, of course, is grindr.  We've talked about it already and he says he's mostly on there to kill time cause he works long night shifts with nothing else to do but wait around and play with your phone.  I have no reason really to distrust him.  He said he still wants to date me and isn't seeing anyone else even though I know this is still early and it would be the acceptable window if he wants to see what's out there, but I think he and I both know it's probably going somewhere.  Should I really worry about using grindr?  I realize we met on there and he didn't try and solicit sex from me.  He's even said once we're officially in a relationship after awhile of dating that he expects both of us to delete grindr.  Am I worrying over nothing?

Now after being single for about two weeks he has decided that ""all men suck ^^ha "", ""they cheat and lie "" and ""Love is not real, why did I invest myself when guys are just going to stab me in the back"" ""Love sucks"" and etc.

My personality is the happy-go-lucky- I try to stay positive and help him through it but I do not have any relationship experience so it is hard for me to help or see his perspective. So for now I am letting him have his temper tantrum but keeping him at ease.

Bros, how did you get through the break up and bouncing back and/or how can I help my roomate look at relationships positively again?
