Bit of back story, I'm 23, a college graduate, on my own, earning my own income, and am pretty much independent. 

So, being independent I figured it was finally time for me to come out to my parents. It's something I've been putting off for a really long time (I've known with some degree of certainty since I was 17), and basically all of my friends know, so this was really the last step. Why would I put this off for so long? Well my parents are in their mid-fifties and are Southern Baptists. Not that every religious, older person is necessarily intolerant, but let's just say I can see that the stereotypes are there for a reason. 

So I decide to tell them at a restaurant about three weeks ago. I probably would have put it off a bit more, but they were doing that thing they do where they ask me about what women are in my life and why I don't have a girlfriend or prospects for a girlfriend or flings or who knows what. I tell them the truth, and it's a bit of a showstopper. I was pretty to-the-point and nice about it, and at first they seemed to be pretty good about it. They said the typical ""We love you no matter what"" and such, but almost immediately after the conversation got a bit darker. My dad mentioned how I was in a bad environment without any good heterosexual examples, then proceeded to drill me on some experience he remembered when we were on vacation where he *claims* I was making advances on a girl a couple of years ago, which is total lunacy and frankly grasping at straws (I don't remember the incident in question). My dad then made  a few more inflammatory statements while my mom was mostly quiet, I went home, and figured things would cool off after a few weeks and maybe things would be alright. After all, I hadn't made much effort over the years to pretend to be interested in women. Frankly I was hoping they'd figure it out on their own, but clearly that wasn't the case.

The next week I get a call from my dad mentioning some concerns about my mom. Apparently she was barely eating, bedridden, and just riddled with depression. Now, I think my mom has suffered from some bits of depression in the past, but this was nothing compared to anything I had ever heard of before. It was like Ms. Bennet from Pride and Prejudice or something. You would think I had told her that I had an inoperable brain tumor or something. Whenever I talked to her over the phone she was just so... down. It was pretty harmful. Then she sent me this email that was basically saying that she had a message from god to deliver to me. The email was rather distressing to get. The email was almost hysterical in tone and she told me to ""explore life more"" and she didn't agree with my ""life choice"", among other things. She never used the word ""gay"", like saying it would make it too real or something. I tried to respond back in the nicest way I could, but obviously the whole situation was difficult to register.

So another week goes by and my mom is supposedly eating more again and is *somewhat* better. My dad decides to spend some more time with me and let me tour his office (he does some cool stuff). So I figure he's just trying to spend more time with me or something to that effect, and everything seems okay. But then towards the end he visits an ATM, withdraws a couple of hundred dollars, and tells me he wants me to go with him to meet some of his ""friends"". Now, I'm a bit of a captive at this point since I'm with him and he's the one driving me home, so I decide to go. He takes me to a strip club. One which he apparently visits regularly. I'm pretty irritated at this point and ready to go home, so I go inside and just sit down. Obviously a bunch of women running around shaking their twats is not my thing, and even though it should have been obvious to my dad, he then pays ""his favorite"" to give me a VIP dance! Now, apparently he had been talking to this girl, because when we got in the booth and it was apparent I wasn't willing to do anything other than just chat with her, she mentioned that my dad had told her my whole story and that he thought I was just ""confused"" and I hadn't experimented enough. Ignoring my feelings that apparently a stripper is my dad's confidant, the whole situation was just beyond anything I had experienced before. I was just totally taken aback.

So obviously after he dropped me off at home I was a bit hot about the whole thing and I don't speak to my dad for about two weeks. This takes us to yesterday, where my mom had apparently signed us up for ""family therapy"". She insisted it was about us being a dysfunctional family and it would be for us as a group. Now, the shrink wasn't a theologist or ""christian counselor"" or anything to that effect, but it was pretty apparent within two minutes of being there that the only thing they wanted to talk about was my being gay. Luckily I was able to be quiet most of the time and just let them vent, but it's very much obvious my dad sincerely feels that I'm making some sort of choice, that I can't be my ""full self"" and be gay (since the two are mutually exclusive to him I think), and that I'm going to get HIV if I ""stay gay"". I mean it was the whole cornucopia of stereotypes. The therapist was quite collected and pretty nice about it all, but overall this situation has been really testing me and I have no idea where to go from here or even what's best. Surely one of you have dealt with this type of situation right? Honestly I wouldn't have pegged my parents as the borderline crazy evangelical types but obviously this is putting them over the top.

We're both in our  early 20s.

He's great and I feel like we could really build something together.  But he's either moving back to his country (across the ocean) in 2-3 years and/or becoming permanently single in 8-10 years.

So I know for a fact that we're going to break up.

In my head I think 'well hey in the grand scheme of things nothing lasts forever' and it helps me a bit but I feel like I'm setting myself up for a lot of pain and it's making me scared to get close to him.  

I want to become a scientist and will probably move around a lot and be busy, and will probably be moving somewhere else for college in a couple years when I transfer, so a relationship sustained longer than a few years *probably* wouldn't work for me right now.

But that's the word.  *Probably.*  What if I meet someone and fall in love.  What if two or three years down the line when one of us has to move, the other goes with them.... Etc...  Or we did a long distance thing.  Or take a break for a little while.  Etc.  There's that element of not being sure.  There's that state of 'this probably won't be the one I settle down with, but it could be; *I don't know.*'

But with this guy, he's really REALLY into this religious thing, and I know there's no reason for me to expect him to not go through with it, because it's what he wants to make him happy.

I feel selfish for being bothered by the expiration date.

But it bothers me.

I also feel creepy for being upset by this like a month into dating him.

But it upsets me.

Thanks!
