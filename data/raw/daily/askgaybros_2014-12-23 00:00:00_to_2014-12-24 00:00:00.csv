This semester, though, things have really really fallen to shit.

I have a few reasons. I did get mono pretty early on but that's not it, depression intensified a lot this semester, which has a lot to do with it. At least as much to do with it is that I'm just a fucking space cadet. I sympathize with people that think ADHD is bull, but I really wasn't that lazy this semester. I drank just twice, I cut way back on videogames and extracurriculars. But I still did really shitty. Maybe I ought to get back on stimulant meds, which I've only taken a handful of times because of the appetite loss.

Regardless of the why, this semester is gonna look like ass on my transcript. I'll probably have a 2.3 GPA coming out of this semester. Now engineers don't need to have something super super high... But, it's hard to work past that. And I feel pretty worthless, especially comparing myself to others I know. I feel like I've fucked up my future. It doesn't help that this guy I've had a tenuous long distance type fling with is a senior who totally has his shit together and has been on the dean's list every semester... I don't really feel good enough at all.

Sorry if this isn't appropriate for the sub, it's just bothersome because the worthlessness I've felt for a while I can partially attribute to depression, but the shitty grades (probs like a 1.5 semester GPA) feels more logical which is scary.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My first two semesters at school, engineering major, weren&amp;#39;t amazing but whatever, 3.0 to that point.

We hit it off pretty well. He's gorgeous, well spoken, polite and we got along so well. I texted him later that night saying I enjoyed myself and would love to hang out again.

I tried to talk to him, see what he was doing, how he was and such, and would get one worded replies, or very blunt responses.

I don't think i've said or done anything to scare him away (we haven't spoken in 2 days at all) but I just feel the need to ask what is wrong/ if he's completely lost interest in me?

For the past few years (about 3), I have not been able to bottom much because of stomach issues.

I apologize for being a little long-winded.

I am not a total bottom, but not a total top either. There are times when I enjoy topping, but I do really enjoy bottoming too. Because of these issues, I have not been able to bottom in a long time. If I had to choose one, I'd probably pick bottom- I was in a relationship with a ""total top"" where I managed. I would have liked to top, but, the relationship still worked. As opposed to if I were in a relationship where I could only top, it wouldn't work for me.

Because of this, I haven't dated anyone in the last several years. It's affecting my possible relationships, which affects my confidence, which affects my self-esteem, and mood, makes me feel depressed, and is really taking a toll on my life.

I currently feel hopeless and depressed, and don't know what to do. I have been to some doctors, but no one really tells me anything.

Without going into too much gross detail- I basically am never completely empty. If I go to the bathroom, I still can't bottom after because something will happen if I do. I've tried cleaning myself out with a water bulb- am never clean even after trying varying amounts of water. I don't want to use a complete enema, because I feel it isn't healthy to do that all the time, and being in a relationship, I think it would be crazy and tiresome to do that all the time in order to have sex in your relationship. I never had to do that when my body was ""normal. As long as I watched what I ate, went to the bathroom, and then showered, I was good to go.

My stool is not one piece or regular either- again not to be too gross, but it is too soft of a consistency and I think smells stronger than is normal. I often feel like I have to go to the bathroom.

I went to my regular doctor, as well as 2 different gastroenterologists. They did blood tests, checked for celiac disease, did a stool sample for parasites as well as anything else they thought might show, and basically said I was normal. One said maybe IBS...and although some of my symptoms may seem similar, I don't believe they all correlate to IBS symptoms. At this point I can't afford to go to the doctor for a colonoscopy or other tests because I have no insurance, but all the doctors said they think I don't need one.

I have tried so many things to improve my stomach, and read so many articles, that I feel I am at my wits' end. I have tried probiotics (I still take some), I've tried changing my diet, I've tried eating more fiber, I've tried taking fiber supplements, metamucil, I've tried going gluten free for months, I stopped drinking milk, I've tried increasing my water intake, I now work out at the gym, I reduced my stress, I get massages....I really really just have no idea what else I can possibly do, or what kind of doctor to see. I feel like going to an energy healer at this point. I alternate between thinking I have IBS, gluten intolerance, and cancer.

If I am not able to fix this, or find out what is wrong, I see myself getting depressed progressively. It's putting me in a bad place, and making me a very unhappy person. 

Does anyone have any other suggestions or know anything about this?

Off to sleep shortly, but will check back.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I guess I am wondering if anyone has had a similar experience, and solved it, or has any advice.

Looking for some advice from my fellow bros and hope this is the right place to ask...

So I have met the most amazing sweetest guy - and I know deep inside that he is the one I will spend the rest of my life with. We've been dating for 1.5yrs now, have a place together, and all in all life is good.

I'm an out individual to friends\coworkers\acquaintances etc, however in relation to my family, it is only my parents and siblings who know, no cousins, no uncles or aunts, etc. The reason for this is because my mother wishes not to upset my very conservative minded grandfather. Based on historical knowledge and past similar events, she knows he will not be okay with the fact that I am gay, and would essentially ""disown"" me and refuse to speak to anyone in the family who would associate with me.

The challenge im faced with is that the man is very wealthy, and there are a number of future inheritances to be had when the time comes for him to be called home - which is likely far off as he is the healthiest 79yo I have ever seen. Because of this, my boyfriend is very understanding of the ""gag rule"" that is pseudo-placed on our relationship.

For me, my silence is not at all about the money I might obtain - love is worth so much more to me. I also make more annually than both my parents and my 2 siblings combined - however that is exactly the point - *my family* stands to gain so much from their inheritances that I would hate to ruin that for them by breaking my silence and having them essentially ""excommunicated"" from my grandfather's life.

So the challenge I face is that I want to share the love of my life with the people in my life that I love...but know there is so much to lose from me actually doing so.

Any advice on where to go from here?

So me and this guy have been best friends since college. We ""dated"" but were both in the closet so we tried our best to keep it a secret. After some time he slowly came out to a few people and eventually his parents found out about us from looking at his phone. Having to deal with his family drama he started to become very needy and a little crazy. Also since I was so scared to come out to people we fought often. I told a few of my close friends but he wanted us to be fully out and that was very scary to me at the time. Because of everything he was dealing with it got to a point where I had to get him in to therapy. Soon after the situation became to stressful so I decided to break it up. He was absolutely heartbroken and so was I. We got back together for a short while but mutually decided to end things. 

So shortly after that he graduated and moved to Atlanta. He dated a few guys but nothing serious. For some reason we never stopped communicating. Every day we texted and have always remained extremely close. After about a year I finally graduated and got a job in Atlanta as well. Problem was that he decided a few months earlier that he wanted to do the peace corps. Initially when he told me I was fine with it, but when it came closer to him leaving I realized I still had so many feelings for him and how hard it would be with him not there in my life. I decided not to tell him when he left because I thought that would be a dick move. 

So pretty quickly when he got to his site I skyped him and told him all these feelings I was still having and how I wanted us to get back together. He told me that I wish I told him earlier and that he had feelings for me as well. Him being away in another country for 2 years is obviously difficult so we decided to remain as best as friends as we could and when he gets back we will try it again. We knew no commitment could be made. 

Early on this year I told all of my friends that I was gay and about two months ago I told my family. It was very difficult but I needed to do it. I've tried to get into the gay scene a bit and have failed to date anyone. Most of it is the fact that I know what I might have waiting for me and no one seems to hold a candle to him.  

It has been a year now since he has been gone and he has been all over the place with how he feels about us getting together. At times he consistently tells me how much he loves me and how optimistic he is about us, other times he seems like he has a lot of doubts and is not sure if we will happen. All of this has made me extremely emotionally, almost to the point of depression. Having something you want so bad and not knowing for 2 years if it will happen. One of the issues is that he is trying to get his masters and doesn't know where he will go. He has a full ride to NYU but has decided to try to get into a school in Atlanta. I did not influence this at all. But through all of this we have never stopped communicating and have been extremely close. 

So bringing it to now, he is currently back for Christmas break and with his family. He will be staying with me this weekend while he visits with me and some of our other friends. We will obviously be talking about ""us"" and I need to know what to say and do. I talked to him recently and he really seemed that he was unsure about us which was something unexpected and kinda broke my heart. He brought up so many doubts but was still saying it could happen. How should I approach this? I want to completely push him away and try and focus on me but I know that would lead us to not getting back together. I think what have been doing has been emotionally destroying me. He has 11 months left in the peace corps and I know I need to change. Being single for so long has made me depressed but have been afraid that if I date someone he would stop talking to me. Even though this post is so long there is still stuff I have left out but I need to know what I should say to him this weekend. This guy is absolutely amazing and I don't want to lose him.
","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its a long story but I will try and keep it as short as possible. So me and this guy have been best friends since college. We &amp;quot;dated&amp;quot; but were both in the closet so we tried our best to keep it a secret. After some time he slowly came out to a few people and eventually his parents found out about us from looking at his phone. Having to deal with his family drama he started to become very needy and a little crazy. Also since I was so scared to come out to people we fought often. I told a few of my close friends but he wanted us to be fully out and that was very scary to me at the time. Because of everything he was dealing with it got to a point where I had to get him in to therapy. Soon after the situation became to stressful so I decided to break it up. He was absolutely heartbroken and so was I. We got back together for a short while but mutually decided to end things. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So shortly after that he graduated and moved to Atlanta. He dated a few guys but nothing serious. For some reason we never stopped communicating. Every day we texted and have always remained extremely close. After about a year I finally graduated and got a job in Atlanta as well. Problem was that he decided a few months earlier that he wanted to do the peace corps. Initially when he told me I was fine with it, but when it came closer to him leaving I realized I still had so many feelings for him and how hard it would be with him not there in my life. I decided not to tell him when he left because I thought that would be a dick move. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So pretty quickly when he got to his site I skyped him and told him all these feelings I was still having and how I wanted us to get back together. He told me that I wish I told him earlier and that he had feelings for me as well. Him being away in another country for 2 years is obviously difficult so we decided to remain as best as friends as we could and when he gets back we will try it again. We knew no commitment could be made. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early on this year I told all of my friends that I was gay and about two months ago I told my family. It was very difficult but I needed to do it. I&amp;#39;ve tried to get into the gay scene a bit and have failed to date anyone. Most of it is the fact that I know what I might have waiting for me and no one seems to hold a candle to him.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been a year now since he has been gone and he has been all over the place with how he feels about us getting together. At times he consistently tells me how much he loves me and how optimistic he is about us, other times he seems like he has a lot of doubts and is not sure if we will happen. All of this has made me extremely emotionally, almost to the point of depression. Having something you want so bad and not knowing for 2 years if it will happen. One of the issues is that he is trying to get his masters and doesn&amp;#39;t know where he will go. He has a full ride to NYU but has decided to try to get into a school in Atlanta. I did not influence this at all. But through all of this we have never stopped communicating and have been extremely close. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So bringing it to now, he is currently back for Christmas break and with his family. He will be staying with me this weekend while he visits with me and some of our other friends. We will obviously be talking about &amp;quot;us&amp;quot; and I need to know what to say and do. I talked to him recently and he really seemed that he was unsure about us which was something unexpected and kinda broke my heart. He brought up so many doubts but was still saying it could happen. How should I approach this? I want to completely push him away and try and focus on me but I know that would lead us to not getting back together. I think what have been doing has been emotionally destroying me. He has 11 months left in the peace corps and I know I need to change. Being single for so long has made me depressed but have been afraid that if I date someone he would stop talking to me. Even though this post is so long there is still stuff I have left out but I need to know what I should say to him this weekend. This guy is absolutely amazing and I don&amp;#39;t want to lose him.&lt;/p&gt;

Obviously the relationship didn't work out but the fact that he was willing to date someone so seemingly undesirable, in my opinion, makes me wonder what on earth he saw in me and whether he views me as being somehow similar?

    As the topic says, I've fallen in love with my best friend, who, unfortunately, is straight. About 2 or 3 months ago I told him I was gay, and he accepted it quite well (Something like: ""Even if you f*cked with elephants, I'd still like you the same!"") and was very supportive. Since then, I've been quite well falling out of love with him, I even saved his relationship with his girlfriend (who is also my good friend), cause some other little chick just messed with his feelings and made him confused. At these times I tried to stand by both of them as much as possible and try to ""fix"" them. Now they are happily again together and I am really happy for that, I really am ... cause it makes me just feel good to see him happy (although it isn't by mi side). 
     As I said, I was falling out of love with him. But like 2 or 3 weeks ago, he suddenly called me, that he had had a car accident, however everyone was alright. But my heart/brain were not alright at that moment. I cried all night, thinking of what I would do if something bad happened to him. And I fell in love with him again, ... and for God's sake, even deeper =/
      So deep, that I even went outside with him, and I had to tell him. First he seemed quite surprised, but then he told me that he was o.k. about it, but that he hoped, nothing would change between us and that we would still be the same friends we had used to be. And I ensured him we would, which is what I want so much. 
      But still, I feel like I can't get over him so easily. It took me 5 years to fall in love with him (we know each other since 7, started being friends in 13 and in 18 I fell in love with him) and don't know how long the falling out could take. I feel like I need to stop seeing him (which would be hard, because we are schoolmates and at the same class) but on the other hand, I do not want to lose him. And I am afraid, that if I just came to him and asked him for (perhaps) 'little time' to erase him out my heart, he could ... understand it wrong and that we would never be such a good friends again =(
   Does anybody have some similar experience? =( It hurts so much, he is the one who can make me the happiest person in a world but with a wave of a wand he can make me the saddest. Still I want him to remain ... part of me.
