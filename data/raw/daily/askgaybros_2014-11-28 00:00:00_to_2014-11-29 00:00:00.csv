Just to give you a background of myself. I'm in Canada and I am from an immigrant family. I'm an only child and my parents made great sacrifices to immigrate here in Canada in their old age. These were sacrifices I never asked for but I would be eternally grateful to them because I would not be where I am right now without them. As you can see, I fucking love my family and I don't want to disappoint them. I'm the smart one and pride of the family. Basically, my cousins are always compared against me (which they usually find unfair). I don't stay out after 11pm unless it's for a project and I also don't drink and smoke. 

I'm currently at the last year of university and right now I'm evaluating what I want out of my life. I'm planning to go to grad school but above all else I realized I want to stop living in a lie. Being gay doesn't define me but at the same time it's part of my identity. I want to stop repressing that side of me and start dating. I never dated anyone because I have this paralyzing fear of getting caught. I know I need to stop thinking about other people's expectations (especially my family's) but I'm sure that I would be completely heartbroken if I see the disappointment in my parent's eyes. But today after reflecting about my life, I realized I'm completely unhappy and lonely and I have no one to blame but myself. I realized that I can't stand my current situation and instead of complaining I should do something to change it. So today, I'm setting a deadline and planning my coming out process. Hopefully by doing this I could muster the courage and be ready to finally come out to my parents.

So what do you think I should do? Should I drop hints? Should I make myself financially independent first? Should I tell a friend first? Nobody knows I'm out and even though I have close friends, I really don't have a close confidant. I'm always apprehensive of sharing my private life with other people which is ironic because I'm sharing it now with all of you.

Any recommendations or advice would be greatly appreciated.

Ok, so I just recently came to the conclusion I'm gay...

How I reached this conclusion-
It started a few years ago, just messing around with a guy friend, R, that quickly turned into a semi-relationship...(he's my absolute best friend) that ended this past May when I met another guy, J, that I could actually see myself with. 
While R and I had a weird relationship, and he's still my closest friend, I actually felt something you might call ""love"" (maybe?) With J... J dumped my a month later.
Anyways, last month I started going on dates with a girl, E, but wasn't feeling to same connection I felt with either J or R, or even with my previous 2 girlfriends (A and B)... While still hanging out with E (w haven't had sex, we literally just get dinner and watch a movie... no cuddling even... it just doesn't feel right) I met this guy, L and it actually feels pretty right. I've had sex with guys and girls before, both physically feel good, but with girls it feels like it's always a show... I feel like there's a script I need to follow, and Lord forbid I miss a step... guys though... guys are a lot of fun- point blank with agendas and desires and it feels more comfortable... I feel like I can be myself and he won't judge.

About me-
I'm tall, and passing for straight. A few of my closest friends have called me out on probably being gay (which I was in denial about)... but I've come out to a couple colleagues and friends and they've all been surprised... I don't look or act like a stereotypical ""gay guy"" (ie: being super flamboyant, or talking with a high pitched voice... ) which, frankly is something I pride myself on (breaking the stereotype, that is). (For the curious- I think I'm somewhere between a 'Wolf' and a 'Jock' ...maybe? Idk I'm new at this)
Oh, also, I'm 22, and renting a house with some friends while in grad school about 4 hours from home... home right now for thanksgiving. I'm not worried about being kicked out.

My parents-
My family is protestant, but we're not practicing... we celebrate Easter and Christmas, but that's pretty much it. My mom, like myself, is pretty political neutral, but my dad's very conservative ... only once ever stating opposition to marriage equality... ""they have the right to marry a women, just like every other man does. What they're seeking isn't equal rights, but just 'special' rights""... etc (I'm not here to have this debate with you)


Anyways- recently something happened, and it lead to my parents asking questions (which I've been dodging, but can't for much longer) but they asked point blank 
""are you gay?""
""No""
""Are you sure?""
(And I didn't answer)

Before I go back to school on Monday im going to have to tell them (along with answering all the questions I've been dodging).

So, tl;dr - how do I come out to my family? How do I make them understand that the only thing that'll change is I might bring home a guy instead of a girl?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Pre-emptive- I&amp;#39;m on mobile, so please excuse any typos and the lack of formatting)&lt;/p&gt;

In years past perhaps I could have stuck around Chicago and had it not be a big deal, but I chose not to because my family and I are very close and I hate the idea of missing a holiday with them. But  a year ago my dad was diagnosed with cancer and he has 1-3 years according to science and the oncologist. So now I feel even more strongly about spending time with my family. If I am not with my dad on the ""last"" holiday I feel like I will never forgive myself. 

It majorly bums my BF out when I'm away, especially for these holidays and that really upsets me too. The past two years he has either stayed home from his family gatherings or left early because he was too anxious/depressed. I never know what to tell him.

Here's the story. (You can just read the dialogue and get a pretty good picture)

We were at a restaurant, waiting for our meal. There was no conversation, just staring at smartphones. 

I remembered all those coming out videos I saw on Youtube earlier that day, and thought how nice it would be to experience that for myself. But I knew that she wasn't going to be like that - we never had a strong relationship, and I knew she was a mediocre Christian. I still wanted to test her. I flipped a coin to let fate decide: Heads, tell her. Tails, forget about it.

I was probably shaking with anxiety as I spun it on the table, because I didn't want to tell her at all. Of course, it was heads. My paranoid consciousness was screaming at me not to tell her, but I did anyway.

""Hey.. there's something I've been meaning to tell you.""

She looked up, and stared at me.

""I'm gay,"" I said.

She continued to stare at me. Each second of silence sent me deeper into an already regretted decision.

""I just.. thought you should know.""

Then the waiter came with our food. She was silent for the rest of the night, except for one question as we were driving home.

""Have you told anyone else?""

""No.""

""Good. You don't know what you are.""

Ever since that night I've felt nothing but hatred and confusion. I bring the topic up every now and again when we're arguing because I want to solicit some type of response.

Each time I bring it up I get a completely new response. The first time, she cried hysterically while saying she's a horrible mother. I didn't argue, I just walked away.

The second time, she asked me if I was molested as a kid. No, but thanks for letting me know you have no idea what you're doing.

The third time was more interesting, because it was at least 6 months later and I knew how I felt. We were driving home from school, and she offered to take me to the fair. I told her ""No"", because the idea of bonding with either of my parents is the most revolting thing I can imagine. With that, she understood that I was becoming distant, and decided to ask me why. She said ""I don't know what's come over you, but you seem to be so full of hate!""

""Do you want to know why?"" I shouted. ""Let's start with your reaction to my sexuality. You love the Bible more than your own son! How am I supposed to forgive you for that?""

""What was I supposed to do?!"" she cried. (She cries often.)

""I don't know, tell me that it doesn't matter, or that you're okay with it? Say it! Say it right now and I can forgive you. Tell me that it's okay.""

She didn't say anything. I haven't spoken about it with her ever since.

At the moment, I just feel done. I'm done with them. They keep trying to invite me to things, and I keep saying no. It gives me pleasure - the same type of pleasure that you get from punching some douche in the face. I don't want to invite them to my graduation. I don't want to speak to them ever again. I only want to move across the country and forget they ever existed.

I know it sounds immature and melodramatic, but maybe you can understand how I feel. I opened myself up to them. I trusted them to do the right thing. Their response? Lukewarm negativity.

Some days I wish they had just gone insane and started registering me for shock therapy. At least then I would know how they feel. Instead, I have a mother who tells me she loves me but continually fails to deliver, and a father who doesn't even know because my mother is too ashamed to tell him.

I want your perspective, gaybros. I want to know if I'm doing the right thing by cutting them off, or if I'm going to deeply regret it for the rest of my life.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I came out to my mother at least a year and a half ago, when I was 16.

I told her &amp;quot;No&amp;quot;, because the idea of bonding with either of my parents is the most revolting thing I can imagine. With that, she understood that I was becoming distant, and decided to ask me why. She said &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s come over you, but you seem to be so full of hate!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Do you want to know why?&amp;quot; I shouted. &amp;quot;Let&amp;#39;s start with your reaction to my sexuality. You love the Bible more than your own son! How am I supposed to forgive you for that?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What was I supposed to do?!&amp;quot; she cried. (She cries often.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know, tell me that it doesn&amp;#39;t matter, or that you&amp;#39;re okay with it? Say it! Say it right now and I can forgive you. Tell me that it&amp;#39;s okay.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She didn&amp;#39;t say anything. I haven&amp;#39;t spoken about it with her ever since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the moment, I just feel done. I&amp;#39;m done with them. They keep trying to invite me to things, and I keep saying no. It gives me pleasure - the same type of pleasure that you get from punching some douche in the face. I don&amp;#39;t want to invite them to my graduation. I don&amp;#39;t want to speak to them ever again. I only want to move across the country and forget they ever existed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know it sounds immature and melodramatic, but maybe you can understand how I feel. I opened myself up to them. I trusted them to do the right thing. Their response? Lukewarm negativity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some days I wish they had just gone insane and started registering me for shock therapy. At least then I would know how they feel. Instead, I have a mother who tells me she loves me but continually fails to deliver, and a father who doesn&amp;#39;t even know because my mother is too ashamed to tell him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want your perspective, gaybros. I want to know if I&amp;#39;m doing the right thing by cutting them off, or if I&amp;#39;m going to deeply regret it for the rest of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

 Maybe it's just the depression talking, but I can't seem to break my way through to feeling the joy. Every asset is countered by a disappointment, etc., etc. Add in enough sanctimonious Facebook memes and parade announcers and I'm more likely to feel angry than grateful.

I don't know if I'm really looking for advice here.

For reference, I'm 21 years old. My sister recently got married and so now the pressure is kind of on me to get married and have kids etc and so I've been really thinking about talking to my parents about my sexuality, but I'm a little worried. They've always been kind and loving to me, but the fact is that we're Indian. Basically if you talk to an Indian about homosexuality, they will say something like ""oh we don't have that in India"". I was wondering if anyone has dealt with this kind of situation or knows someone who has and if they could give me some advice. Thanks in advance.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys. For reference, I&amp;#39;m 21 years old.

I'm not really worried about people at school because I don't really care what anybody there thinks (although it doesn't matter since no one will know for a long long time anyway), but I'm just scared to death of my future. I am 99.9% sure that my parents would respond completely negatively, but I'm not sure exactly what they'd do considering the thought that their son could be gay is so far out there. The basis of our relationship, to my chagrin, is God. They have a very very deep hatred of gay people and, I kid you not, believe that we are influenced by the devil. (Hey, at least we're not possessed by demons, right?)

So attempting some sort of acceptance in 5+ years when college is paid for and I can begin to become economically independent is out of the question.

Despite the shittiness of this situation, I'm quite mentally stable, and all I really want to know is y'all's thoughts and maybe some stories from some of you who have been in the same horrid situation but are further in life than I am.

Edit: I should probably mention that I have a trust fund coming to me when I'm 18 and some inheritance from my mom's parents. Living frugally I could pretty easily use it to get on my feet when I become independent, so it's not like I'd have to live in a box if I get kicked out.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m 16 (oh gee, in the South) and pretty much everyone I know is extremely homophobic.
