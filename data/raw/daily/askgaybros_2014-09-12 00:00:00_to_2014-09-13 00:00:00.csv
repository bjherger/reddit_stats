My boyfriend, let's call him... Ross [35/m], and I [26/m] have been dating for a year. Things felt really great between us. However, neither of us spend a lot of time with each other's friends and we are yet to meet each other's family.                      

This bothered Ross. He felt like he was in love with me and I didn't really care. To him, I wasn't serious. He thought I was more focused on my career and thought I was happy to live in separate worlds. He wanted to take a break so that I could have time to decide what I really wanted. He wanted to make plans for the future, share our lives and move in together. I was upset, I wish he had communicated with me before it go to this. I wish he led by example. Despite this, I agreed to the time out. He handled it beautifully. We hugged for a while and I went home.                     

Life intervened and the break ended up being 3 weeks long. Over this time, we texted and talked every second day. I missed Ross terribly. I told him this. I began to feel like we should be more involved. I wanted more. I wanted him. Ross tells me he misses me, though he seems to feel like things aren't going to work out. He thinks I'm headed in a different path. He still cares about me a lot.                     

Last night, we agree to meet. I have a lot to talk to him about. While we're on the phone chatting away, my curiosity kicks in and I ask him if he has seen anyone since we took the time out. He tells me he had a date. WHAT?! They had sex. FUCK! I feel physically sick and completely betrayed.
Ross tells me that he didn't feel like he did anything wrong. He would never be unfaithful. We weren't together. He has needs and never meant to hurt me. He cares about me. I fume. I feel low. I feel self-conscious, miserable and confused. This hurts me in my core. If he cared about me or about us, he would talk to me? He would ask if I was comfortable? He would know it would hut me? He would not be with someone else... The worst part is I know he genuinely does or did love me, but maybe he's given up?                    

I think it's over. This is something I'm not very forgiving about, but at the moment, I'm trying to not let me knee-jerk reaction take over. What do you think? Have you been in a similar situation? Do you feel like he has lost interest? Should I cut my losses?                

Thank you in advance. Honestly appreciate you reading this.

We plan to move in within the next few months.

  I stay over at his house about 5 nights a week. I can kind of tell it's not his thing to see each other so often, but it just kind of developed.  He is very introverted, and likes to have alone time.  There are times where I will ask if he randomly wants to grab dinner or something on an off day, but he will always decline and seem irritated.  I am not introverted at all, and it's impossible for me to get sick of someone (I can live with anyone).

  Since we bike together, and I am there so often, I just leave it at his house.  Sometimes I like to go riding without him, and I'll ask to come get it when we weren't going to see each other that day.  When I do this, he acts like a total dick and says something like ""grab it and get out"".  He won't even look at me and will ignore most of what I say.  There is no just sitting down for a min and talking.  Since I am pretty affectionate, I have a hard time with NOT being able to at least kiss goodbye or something.  So when I ask, he just gets super pissed off and tell me to get out.  If he is busy with something, he will say something like ""i'm busy with ___ in the basement, don't come down here, just grab it and go"".

  Since we plan on living together it makes me feel kind of shitty because I will have to come back home at some point every night.  I will admit I have a hard time with giving space, well at least to someone who is introverted, so I don't want to stress out the relationship.  I just don't know if I am even able to tell him how I feel about it, because in the end, I am basically the needy one who isn't listening.

When I do this, he acts like a total dick and says something like &amp;quot;grab it and get out&amp;quot;.  He won&amp;#39;t even look at me and will ignore most of what I say.  There is no just sitting down for a min and talking.  Since I am pretty affectionate, I have a hard time with NOT being able to at least kiss goodbye or something.  So when I ask, he just gets super pissed off and tell me to get out.  If he is busy with something, he will say something like &amp;quot;i&amp;#39;m busy with ___ in the basement, don&amp;#39;t come down here, just grab it and go&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we plan on living together it makes me feel kind of shitty because I will have to come back home at some point every night.  I will admit I have a hard time with giving space, well at least to someone who is introverted, so I don&amp;#39;t want to stress out the relationship.  I just don&amp;#39;t know if I am even able to tell him how I feel about it, because in the end, I am basically the needy one who isn&amp;#39;t listening.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm only out to a handful of people but even with them, I don't feel completely comfortable talking about ""gay stuff"" like saying a guy is hot. I know they support me but I just don't feel comfortable talking about it. I think it's less about being gay and more about general undesire to talk about sex and things like that. I accept my sexuality but if someone asks me if I'm gay, I start panicking and dance around the question (which probably gives them their answer). 

I really don't like it because i feel like I'm not being true to myself or my friends.

I ended up reading the conversations he had with 2 guys: his best friend and a guy he was kinda seeing before me. I know I shouldn't have read and feel bad about it(and it's actually the first and only time I've done it).


So, long story short:
Late March - We start going out
Late May - We start getting more serious
Late June - We became official boyfriends(3 months ago)

My boyfriend loves privacy and I really try to respect that and I never read any of his texts/facebook/whatever before.

So I read his conversation with his best friend from April/May: There were conversations like ""I don't feel like going out with X(me)"" or ""He's great but I don't think he's the one"", etc.. I know he had these conversations before we became official boyfriends but reading that really hurt me and my selfesteem.

The worst part was the conversation I read with his other friend: So this conversation was around MID JULY, after we became boyfriends. My bf initiated the conversation with this guy and he asked him if he wanted to go out or come over to his place and to see him naked but they couldn't do anything(wtf?). His friend asked why and my bf said he was kinda seeing someone(we were bfs by then damn). And his friend said he wouldn't go because he wouldn't like how the other person(me) would feel.


So I haven't brought this up to my bf. I can't tell him I read his facebook. He'll get extremely mad that I broke his trust reading his messages. I feel sad, reading that even though this conversation was almost 2 months ago.

My bf is great, he buys me presents, he wants to hang out with me, etc...

But I know these 2 keep talking and I started getting really jealous and my bf got really mad saying I have to trust him and that he won't do anything because he's with me. But of course he doesn't know what I read.

P.S- English not my first language, sorry about the mistakes.

Please give me your opinion and what you would do. These last 2 days have been really hard on me and I really love him but I can't stand him cheating me(not that he did exactly I guess).

I've worked at the same place for 10 years now and have always been in the closet. When speaking about my personal life, I swapped my partner's name for a female name and switched pronouns. I have also purposefully created a wall to distance myself from personal discussions as much as possible. Throughout the years I have come up with any number of excuses to not to go to or show up alone at gatherings where SOs are welcome (Christmas parties, etc). Even with all this, I've made it up the chain to high-level management role and I'm well-known, liked and respected throughout the company.

After all this time, just can't deal with being in the closet anymore.  So tired of the lie. I feel like maybe I can make a positive difference for folks who don't necessarily know gay people. Keep in mind this is a mid-sized company in the south and in a very ""good ole boy"" industry so it's not like I would be coming out in NY or Seattle. But, I'm over it. If anyone has a problem with it, it's their problem. 

Well, I just came out to my boss, the president of the company (we work very closely), and a close circle of work friends and it went excellent. For the most part they knew and have been ""protecting me"" for a while now. By protecting I mean putting the hammer down on anyone who got too curious about my personal life - basically keeping people out of my personal business. They all wanted to give me the space I needed and harbor an environment where I would feel safe to come out but only when I was ready. I'm very happy and proud to work with these guys. I feel very accepted and loved.

Problem is I'm not done coming out, even though I'm done pretending. I'm only planning on coming out one-on-one with a couple more close people, but after that I just cannot imagine hitting up many more. Coming out speeches SUCK!!!! (even though I shouldn't complain since it's all been good so far). There are managers I work with and have befriended who don't work in the corporate office (where I do) and I can't imagine doing it over the phone. There's a whole slew of people who work around me who I'm not close enough to to want to hit up personally. My boss and the president want to help me with this process - whatever it looks like. They have even suggested doing the ""outing"" for me - basically tell people, ""this is what the deal is and you will not have a problem with it."" As much as I love they are willing to do this for me, I don't feel right about it - like it's my deal to handle. I don't want the news to spread like gossip. The thought of coming out to a group of people at the same time ""forum-style"" mortifies me, but I see this as the only other avenue to get in front of the message and be done with it once and for all. 

Coming out was the right thing to do, but I'm stressing out about what to do next and I don't want it to spread as gossip. Any thoughts on what I should do?

TL;DR After 10 years, came out to a few people at work, but I'm not really done coming out to everyone else (like 100 people) and I have no idea how to do it. Can you help me figure out what to do next?

Homeless basically, no reliable family nearby.He comes to stay with my family for a short time but it's going on 6 months now (he moved out briefly into a mutual friends apartment but she ended up being insane so he came back here). Just for the record, he hasn't at any point overstayed his welcome.
So today a friend of mine stops by to pick up some shit she left here the other night and we're just hanging out when she pulls me aside to ask me if K and I are dating. I laugh and tell her no, the conversation moves on and she eventually leaves. We were sitting in my room shortly thereafter and I mentioned it to him, we both laughed and he said ""See, I told you! Gay by association!"" The discussion carried on and he mentioned how a mutual friend of ours had given him a weird look when he learned that K had been staying with me/hanging out a lot. At this point it was clear that he was a little distraught and he was talking about all the people who might think we're dating. To which I respond ""Oh well, who the fuck cares"". He immediately becomes irate, ""I fucking care, I don't want people going around saying ""oh did u\you hear K is a faggot?"" Now, as someone who was closeted once I can obviously understand being distressed by people thinking you're gay, but I am getting a little annoyed. Not annoyed because I'm offended so much as because I feel as though he's holding it against me. Like, do you want a solution from me? The only solution would be to move out. Well anyway, he keeps bitching but by this point I'm understandably a little short with him and this causes him to storm out of the room. I'm a little blown away this seems out of nowhere but it's irritating as fuck.
Am I trivializing his concerns? I mean it could affect his dating life... Has anybody had a similar experience?

Anyways today I got an email with a strange offer. This guy is asking if I have an amazon wishlist and offered to buy a few things for me upfront to ""show he's genuine."" Then he'd want to occasionally skype me while he's on poppers. He wants to become my ""cash slave"" (???) and have me ""get inside his head"" as he continues to buy me stuff.

Is it because I still have that conservative societal views ingrained in my head (because I have never EVER seen any old gay couples prior to the video), or is it because of something else?
