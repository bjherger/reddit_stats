I'm having an awkward situation with my now-husband's family that I'm not really sure how to handle.

We've been together for five years and I've been going over to his family's get-together's for much of that time, including the past three Christmases. He warned me in the beginning that they were pretty conservative in their Christianity, but I thought I got along with them really well. I didn't become best friends or anything, but the relationship with everyone in his family seemed cordial and pleasant. 

Over the summer, we announced that we were getting married in a very small ceremony to include only families and very close friends. It wasn't until the day of that some of his family members (including his grandparents and his brother) broke the news to us that they wouldn't come, citing reservations about same-sex marriage. I was surprised, but too busy at the time to sit down and dwell on it. The show went on, and it was a beautiful day. 

It's holiday time, and I'm back to seeing the whole gang again a bunch this week, including the ones that wouldn't come to our wedding. I find myself being really bitter and slightly nasty towards them. I'm not actively scorning them, but I'm not approaching them to make conversation and I'm giving only the tersest answers to their questions before moving along to someone else. What really got me was an interaction that went something like:

Grandmother: How was your trip to Paris?

Me: Our *honeymoon* to Paris was great. 

I wasn't so ambitious that I thought that I could single-handedly change their views on homosexual relationships. But I thought that five years of being with this guy (their brother / grandson) would at least make them see that *our relationship* was valid and worth celebrating. All those years, they knew my name, who I was, and they even seemed comfortable talking and playfully joking with me with my then-boyfriend. He and I bought a house together, owned pets together, took vacations together, and were (are) by all reasonable assessments a stable and loving couple. And after all that, they couldn't give me enough credibility to come to a 15 minute wedding ceremony.

Has anyone been through something similar? Is it valid to feel that way towards them? If so, how do I get past that? The logical side of my brain knows that attendance at my wedding shouldn't be a litmus test for who is and isn't an asshole, but other side of my brain sure likes the sound of it. I'll have to be around these people for the rest of my life (or, at least their lives).

I've lived in a rather small town for the last few years, and unfortunately I've had a hard time making friends. Being a small town, most people are pretty very close minded when it comes to gay people. I have acquaintances, but no actual friends, and it was like this for some time. I was okay about it, I guess, because I made trips back home every so often and saw and partied with all of my friends.

Recently I met a guy at work and we seemed to get along great. At first I was really confused because he seemed to be flirting with me, but he ended up actually being straight, which was ok. He started texting me all the time, asking what I was up to, random song lyrics, or just other stuff.  One night he invited me to hang out with him and one of his friends, and we had a lot of fun. 

He did confess to me that he too had a hard time making friends because he has no filter and says what's on his mind. I figured I could handle it.  He and his friend were even courteous enough to ask if I was offended by gay jokes and if so they would be mindful of what they said around me. I said I wasn't because for the most part, I'm really not.  We've hung out several times since then and the texts keep coming in. It's something I haven't had in a while so it was nice to be able to have someone to hang out with. Most nights I'm usually at home by myself or spend extra time at the gym.

Anyways, the problem comes in when he invites an old friend of his to hang out with us called Mark. Not trying to say this guy gives me bad vibes because he's been nice to me since I met him, but my co-worker seems to try so hard to impress him when he's around, to the point that it makes me uncomfortable. When he's around, he gets to drinking, and the topic of conversation for the entire night centers around my sexuality in a sort of demeaning way.  It's happened twice now, and a few nights ago was the worst. I was with family, and he kept bugging me to come hang out with them, and I wanted to, so finally I got away from family and showed up at his place. Mark was there, and I immediately had a bad vibe but decided to give it a chance. My co-worker got to drinking along with the other 2, I had 2 beers.  We were sitting around and once again my sexuality becomes the focus point of the night for this guy. He puts on some music, pulls up a chair next to me, starts rapping in my face, touching me, and changing some of the lyrics into some sort of gay joke. He did this for about a good hour. The other 2 just laughed and were barely paying attention. He passed it off as 'Ah, we're just kidding with you, haha!, but he could tell that I wasn't happy, yet he kept going. The whole night I felt so uncomfortable but I stayed for some weird reason. Maybe it was because I was afraid of losing the only friend I'd had in quite a while, so I took the abuse. Eventually I'd had enough and left. He text me after I left apologizing and saying he thought I knew they were joking.  I haven't heard from him since, that was 2 days ago, where he usually texts me every day. I haven't said anything because I'm still on the fence as to whether I want to be friends with this guy or not. I'd really like to be, because he's nice and he makes me laugh, but I'm not sure if it's worth it.  

He kind of gives me a gay vibe too, although he's pointed out the fact that he is straight and is talking to some girls, but I'm not looking too deeply into that.

18 M here, college freshman. Super closeted.

Recently I stumbled upon a really cute guy, 17 high school senior in the area-ish. It was his instagram profile. Not to sound weird but I looked at his photos and I deduced he's gay because he has no straight male friends and he's into lana del Rey and like all that fashion stuff.

We seem to have some mutual followers or whatever but no friends in common really even though from what I read on his profile he seems to have a nice personality.

I ended up following him, and cool enough he followed me back. For Christmas I made a post with my dog and he liked it. Mind you we don't even know each other.

So is there a way for me to show him I am interested without seeming like a creeper? Like I'm not the most assertive guy unless I'm comfortable with someone, so you can imagine I rather not go and pursue him on all his other social networking stuff. I have my snapchat posted on my Instagram so I mean if he was interested he could always add me and we could go from there, but I feel pigeonholed with instagram. I don't even know if he likes me or is interested, so yeah. If there was a way for me to introduce myself and talk to him and find out if he's interested and if he's not, I could just part ways which is totally fine.

Now I'm 19, but I'm still incredibly uncomfortable with my sexuality. I know for a fact that I am gay, but it is hard for me to think about it without feeling incredibly discomforted. Even typing this now feels weird. 

I've hooked up with guys -- older guys who I won't ever see again -- but the encounters were entirely disconnected from my normal life.

I've come out to two close friends, and I'm happy I did, but they weren't very cathartic moments. 

I go to a small college and it's not that easy finding guys I'm interested in who are gay. I feel like the best way to ground my sexuality would be to date, but again it isn't too easy at a small school. There are things like the mentorship program through the lgbt resource center, but to be honest I'm not sure how much it would help as it seems the mentors aren't necessarily the 'gay bro-ish' type, or people I would feel comfortable talking to.

1.) He seems to gaze into my eyes: Typically when I speak to other males, eye contact is present, however not as constant as it is with him.

2.) He acts ""cute"" around me: He acts around me the way girls that have been attracted to me act. Almost trying to get my attention and find ways to engage me, rather than a topic and conversation like I do with my other friends.

3.) Jealousy/passive-aggressiveness: He often times acts in a passive aggressive manner, almost trying to get me to ""miss"" him, like some sort of power-play. Before he came out it confused me a lot, and I honestly saw him as weak and pathetic for it, but once again it seems to familiar to how a chick would act.

I'm sorry to be bringing down the mood on Christmas day, I just feel so so horrible, and I need an outlet... at least to not feel so alone for a few seconds.  
  
I moved to LA 2 years ago, and I've thrown myself into my work, trying to get my career off the ground, and a business (I mean... that's the reason why I came here). Now that I have a break for 2 weeks, I've realized that I am completely alone in this big city - and it is killing me not having even a single friend.  
  
I have Asperger's syndrome, so it's really hard for me to make friends. I get terrified of social scenarios, but I've been trying to make an effort with no results.  
  
I also had a boyfriend. He was my best friend, and I loved the man so much. He was everything for me, and I would had given anything for him. I tried to make sure he knew how much I loved him everyday. I showered him with surprises randomly, and I saw a future with him. He had his problems, but so do I - and I loved him so much that I could had worked through them. But every time we had a small argument, or I got upset, he would start crying and saying that I don't love him and appreciate him (which is far from the truth). 
Last week I told him that something he did I didn't like and made me sad, and he gave me the same speech. He then got up and left me, and I've never heard from him again.  
  
Now I don't have anyone. No one to celebrate christmas with, or talk to. I feel like my 4 walls in my room are the edge of the world, and there's nothing outside. I feel like my only way out is suicide.  
  
I know it sounds stupid, and I never though I would ever think that way. But I don't know what else to do. I've been trying to distract myself with movies and games, but the thoughts keep creeping back.  
  
I'm so sorry for posting here. Please don't feel obligated to reply. I just wanted to vent a bit to see if it helps.

Thank you all.  
  
EDIT: Thank you all for your replies. I'll try to answer everyone little by little, but you have all really helped and made me feel a bit better. I'm kinda feeling ""numb"" now. Not sad, or happy. Just numb. :\

We broke up several times, but would get back together about a month later. He would always apologize and say it wouldn't happen again/etc to only break my trust again.

I'm not sure if it would come from things he said or my own head, but somehow I would always feel guilty, that I was never enough, or if I had just done something else, asked him how he felt in a pressing way, or something similar that everything would have been fine. Regardless, the last time we broke up was meant to be the final straw.. I had access to personal accounts of his and for the first time saw everything he was saying and sending. It broke me in so many ways and I kicked him out.

Fast forward a year later and I've started dating someone else.. He shows up apologizing, saying he's changed, that he would do anything for me and wants a chance to prove it and fix things. I'm happy right now and thought I had moved on, but he's brought all these thoughts of ""what if"".

Have any of you ever given someone another chance in a similar situation? I've found myself constantly mulling it over lately and I don't know what to do..

I've yet to tell anybody, but it feels amazing to be comfortable with myself as I'm sure many of you know. 

I decided to check out Grindr to see if there were any normal guys around in my small largely-christian town. I made myself a profile with a picture of an average looking guy, and I put average stats.  I made the guy a seemingly-average age, 23 years old. In hindsight this was a horrible mistake. The problem is that I'm far from any of that; I'm still a minor, at only sixteen years old.

One super handsome really cute 24 year old guy messaged me. I messaged him back thinking that nothing would come of it as I could just back out by saying that I wasn't looking to hook up, which I naively assumed was what all guys on there were planning to do.

This is where things started to go a bit off the rails. He said that he'd just gotten out of a long-term relationship and wasn't looking to hook up either. I thought okay, well I can still just back out by ignoring him or something right? It's a dick move but I can get away with it without my conscience being in ruins from the guilt. I guess you could say that we clicked. We kept talking and talking into the night and I realized that I'd gone too far. We'd told each other about our lives, mine was riddled with lies about which university I went to, and where I work (neither of which I've done yet). I knew that I was in big trouble so I told him that I had only gotten a few hours of sleep, so I was basically going to drop dead if I didn't get some rest so that I could end the conversation. 

I woke up to a message from him giving me his number today, and that's where I really started to panic. 

I know that I'm a terrible, awful, creepy person. I know I shouldn't have even been on the app.  I know that in every situation it's going to end with him and I no longer talking, because who the fuck would want to continue interactions with some creepy catfishing teenager? 

Regardless of all that, can I please *please* get some help/advice on what I should do about this?   

**edit**: Just thought that I should add that nothing remotely sexual took place. We didn't exchange pictures or anything like that. We didn't talk about plans to do anything sexual. I never had any intentions of doing so. Some of you are talking about the potential criminal evidence here, but it was honestly just friendly conversation. Thought I'd clarify.      

**Update**: He took it pretty well. Apparently it was his third time just this month that that happened to him... I guess it really goes to show that my town needs some sort of resource for homosexual youth to meet. Thanks for the advice those of you who gave it. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have recently come to terms with my sexuality. I&amp;#39;ve yet to tell anybody, but it feels amazing to be comfortable with myself as I&amp;#39;m sure many of you know. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to check out Grindr to see if there were any normal guys around in my small largely-christian town. I made myself a profile with a picture of an average looking guy, and I put average stats.  I made the guy a seemingly-average age, 23 years old. In hindsight this was a horrible mistake. The problem is that I&amp;#39;m far from any of that; I&amp;#39;m still a minor, at only sixteen years old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One super handsome really cute 24 year old guy messaged me. I messaged him back thinking that nothing would come of it as I could just back out by saying that I wasn&amp;#39;t looking to hook up, which I naively assumed was what all guys on there were planning to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where things started to go a bit off the rails. He said that he&amp;#39;d just gotten out of a long-term relationship and wasn&amp;#39;t looking to hook up either. I thought okay, well I can still just back out by ignoring him or something right? It&amp;#39;s a dick move but I can get away with it without my conscience being in ruins from the guilt. I guess you could say that we clicked. We kept talking and talking into the night and I realized that I&amp;#39;d gone too far. We&amp;#39;d told each other about our lives, mine was riddled with lies about which university I went to, and where I work (neither of which I&amp;#39;ve done yet). I knew that I was in big trouble so I told him that I had only gotten a few hours of sleep, so I was basically going to drop dead if I didn&amp;#39;t get some rest so that I could end the conversation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up to a message from him giving me his number today, and that&amp;#39;s where I really started to panic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that I&amp;#39;m a terrible, awful, creepy person. I know I shouldn&amp;#39;t have even been on the app.  I know that in every situation it&amp;#39;s going to end with him and I no longer talking, because who the fuck would want to continue interactions with some creepy catfishing teenager? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of all that, can I please &lt;em&gt;please&lt;/em&gt; get some help/advice on what I should do about this?   &lt;/p&gt;

We went to a mutual friend's to celebrate for Christmas, and when we were on his car he told me i could stay the night a this place. 

When we got there he told me if it was ok to share a bed because it was five in the morning and if not he'd have to put blankets on a new one. At that time i already knew how were going to end... we didn't sleep and i left at 12pm.

The thing is, when he broke up with me he told me it was because he wasn't into guys and that he wanted a ""simpler"" and ""normal"" life. I never end up believing this... may i say we had a 4years relationship? 

Having said these, before we made anything he was like all the time telling me that it might not be a good idea and that he doesn't want me to get the wrong idea and that we weren't getting back together. To which i said i had no problem at all and that i completely understand. I mean, he was already half-naked and over me... i was horny as hell! 

Later this morning he asked me if i was OK and if we messed it up last night. I told him everything was fine. But the thing is... i don't know how to proceed. Last night showed i was right, he is completely into guys and he stills likes me... should i make any move? I think the best thing would be to let some time pass and see what happens. I arranged to travel abroad so it might help? I also happened to be developing a sort of really good friendship/potential relationship with another guy...
