I'm almost 25 and have never been in a relationship. I'm fact the longest I've ever dated a guy is 3 weeks. I seem to go on a lot of first and second dates but it never goes anywhere. Even the guys who seem incredibly interested at first just stop texting after a week or two. I've gotten all the lines ""I need me time""...""I don't want a relationship"" etc. 

I make it clear from the get go that I'm not looking to hook up but I've never pushed for a relationship or even implied that I want one.

People always ask me how I'm single but then even those guys end up just not texting back. 

I feel like I'm out of options and desperate. 

Am I doing something wrong? I can't even seem to get a date anymore. 

Signed,
Lonely and hopeless 

Edit: well I got a lot of responses. There are pics in my post history if you want to dig for them. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bros,&lt;/p&gt;

Well, wall of text incoming..

Few months ago i started chating with this guy through an app, eventually, we met up a few times, and i thought that he was interested in me. I'm relatively new to all this and its my first experience in all that dating stuff. I thought things were going well, and I'm starting to like him.

However, for the past few weeks the texts seemed like i was putting in way more effort than he was. I was beginning to think that he might not be interested at all, so i decided to tell him how i felt. To get a definite answer, and to know that i at least tried, instead of wondering how it could have gone. My suspicions were right, he mentioned that he wasn't into me, and he was just looking forward to being friends, and then apologized to me. I replied that its okay and we stopped talking ever since.

Well my question is, is it weird that i still want to be friends with this guy, or should i just stay away? I mean he was the one that introduced me basically to gay clubs and helped somewhat with my coming out...

I really appreciate if i could get some advice guys, thanks!

So my reaction to something that literally happened in front of me yesterday is bothering me. I did a two-a-day at the gym yesterday night to do cardio (**after months of skipping**, *gasp*). I was near the last 1/4 of my workout when this even happened.

So I was at the roman chair, when I see this gorgeous Asian guy walk on the floor. Sure, I started for a bit but then he sort of stopped in front of the roman chair and kept looking in front of him. I was sort of annoyed that he was in my way and that is what made me realize what was going on. 

He had come up to see his boyfriend who was working out with a trainer. I noticed this was the case by observation. The boyfriend was this white guy, average height, somewhat muscular, blue eyes, his face looked a bit old for his age though. To my taste, the Asian guy was the hot one in the relationship, but I digress. Anyway, so the Asian guy apparently wanted to surprise the white guy and kept on staring at him from a close distance with a big smile. I could see the care/love/infatuation/happiness in his eyes, and just staring at the other guy, waiting for the other to notice his presence as a nice surprise. Then the white guy introduced the Asian guy to his trainer. Then the Asian guy left. Not sure what was said, but the trainer asks how long they have been together and the white guy says a few weeks. /story

Now I feel like an asshole because of my reaction. I think this scene that developed in front of my eyes stirred some mega feels. I got really jealous/mad. I was in thinking ""like wtf did this guy do to snag this hot Asian, I've been wanting one since forever, and this guy got one."" How did they meet? And then i had to take a breather. Then i started thinking how then they were going to have a nice dinner and probably have hot sex after. While i was going to be tired as fuck, hungry, and alone with my bae the empty pillow. And then I exercised with intensity and went to shower.

I mean I dont know them but I feel like my reaction was wrong. Like i should be happy they have young love and are experiencing a relationship, yet I'm being a hater for realizing my reality. I feel like an asshole. I need some advice from you guys so things like this dont get to me. Thanks.

EDIT: I know this posts sounds shallow but please bear with me. I understand where the negative comments are coming from. I don't have racial hangups but yes I do tend to find Asians to be very attractive. I apologize for the crimgeworthy phrases.


**tl;dr:** I was at the gym last night. Hot Asian guy comes in to surprise visit his boyfriend. This scene happens in front of eyes.

I've been reading posts on this sub for a while, and you're such a helpful community, so I'm hoping you can help me out with a situation I'm facing… I'll put up a tl;dr below.

Just some history; I came out to my parents 11 years ago (I'm 27 now). To say it didn't go well would be an understatement… A week after I told my parents, I was kicked out of home and forced to live on the streets. My brothers disowned me, as did my sisters. They said that they never wanted to hear or see me again, and that I was dead to them. I was living on the streets for just over a week, when a friends mother heard about what happened and insisted I stay with her and her family for as long as I needed. This is who I consider my family, because they made sure I completed my homework, went to school, had food in my stomach and had a comfortable place to sleep. Because of my adopted family, I got a very high mark in my Year 12 exams, graduated from a great university, landed my dream job, and am financially secure (to the point where I never have to worry about money again). 

A week ago, I got a call from my sister, who I have not spoken to in 11 years. She called to tell me that my birth mother is dying from a very aggressive form of cancer, and she doesn't have long to live (less than 6 months). I just said 'okay, so why did you call me'? Turns out my birth mother wants to see me and try to make amends. As do my brothers, sisters and father. During a very short conversation with my sister, she mentioned that they are all falling on hard times and struggling to get by. I said that I had to go and that I would talk later. She continued to call, and I rejected all her communications. 

I don't know what I should do. These people were emotionally and physically abusive for a majority of my life, making my life hell on earth. I'm torn at what to do though. 95% of me says to forget them and let them live with the decision they made, but the other 5% wants to be there and help in anyway possible. I'm conflicted in what to do.

I've discussed this with my boyfriend of 6 years, and he said that it would be better if I visit, because I might regret it later in life. I really don't know what to do… I haven't been answering any calls or messages and I don't know if I should. Have you been in a similar situation? If so, what did you do and do you feel like it benefited you later in life? Any help/advice would be great. Thank-you.

I've always wanted to hook up with Dave even though he's ""straight"".  The first few times I hung out with Dave I thought he was into me, however, he hooked up with a decent number of girls at the time and currently has a girlfriend that he lives with.  I learned to accept that Dave wouldn't be interested in hooking up with me so I never tried to push it upon him. Over the few years I've known him though we've grown to be really close friends.  At the same time in the back of my mind, however, I've secretly really really wanted to hook up with him.

Last week, we went to a concert with a few of his friends from his hometown.  Before going to the concert, he told a few people that they could sleep on the floor of his bedroom because his girlfriend was out of town for the night (Dave and his girlfriend share a bed).  When we got back from the concert, we were all really drunk and one of Dave's friends quickly passed out in Dave's room.  This really pissed off Dave and he told his other friends to get this kid out of his room.  One of Dave's friends (I'll call him Steve) started talking to Dave about 10 feet away from so they could have a somewhat private conversation, even though I could make out bits and pieces of what they were saying because they were drunk and unintentionally loud.  I wasn't trying to pay attention to their conversation until Steve yelled, ""Why are you so pissed that people are sleeping in your room? You're girlfriend isn't even here.""  Dave's response was that he wanted the room to himself so he could fuck me...(he was really drunk and definitely didn't intend on me hearing that).  At first, because I hadn't been trying to pay attention to their conversation, I was in disbelief and had to try and listen to more of what they were saying.  I was able to make out bits and pieces of what they were saying and sure enough, my name was mentioned a few times and there was also talk about ""banging dudes"".  It makes a little bit of sense now because Dave has always been a pretty touhcy person when he gets drunk but on this night, he was pretty much cuddling with me on a couch in his living room and told me that he though I was hot.

Is it safe to assume that Dave is into me?  What do I do now? How do I bring this up?  I'd love to hook up with Dave but I would more importantly like to help him out as a friend. He has a girlfriend that he lives with so I understand that he can't and probably won't just admit to liking me because he won't really have a place to live for a bit if his girlfriend kicks him out?  Dave also comes off as very very self-conscious and anxious about everything and I could easily see him denying the conversation that I overheard.

Also, if this matters, I'm bi...only a few of my close friends know...I never specifically told Dave that I'm into guys but I know that he knows","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;ve known one of my best friends for like 3 years now (I&amp;#39;ll call him Dave).  I&amp;#39;ve always wanted to hook up with Dave even though he&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;straight&amp;quot;.  The first few times I hung out with Dave I thought he was into me, however, he hooked up with a decent number of girls at the time and currently has a girlfriend that he lives with.  I learned to accept that Dave wouldn&amp;#39;t be interested in hooking up with me so I never tried to push it upon him. Over the few years I&amp;#39;ve known him though we&amp;#39;ve grown to be really close friends.  At the same time in the back of my mind, however, I&amp;#39;ve secretly really really wanted to hook up with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, we went to a concert with a few of his friends from his hometown.  Before going to the concert, he told a few people that they could sleep on the floor of his bedroom because his girlfriend was out of town for the night (Dave and his girlfriend share a bed).  When we got back from the concert, we were all really drunk and one of Dave&amp;#39;s friends quickly passed out in Dave&amp;#39;s room.  This really pissed off Dave and he told his other friends to get this kid out of his room.  One of Dave&amp;#39;s friends (I&amp;#39;ll call him Steve) started talking to Dave about 10 feet away from so they could have a somewhat private conversation, even though I could make out bits and pieces of what they were saying because they were drunk and unintentionally loud.  I wasn&amp;#39;t trying to pay attention to their conversation until Steve yelled, &amp;quot;Why are you so pissed that people are sleeping in your room? You&amp;#39;re girlfriend isn&amp;#39;t even here.&amp;quot;  Dave&amp;#39;s response was that he wanted the room to himself so he could fuck me...(he was really drunk and definitely didn&amp;#39;t intend on me hearing that).  At first, because I hadn&amp;#39;t been trying to pay attention to their conversation, I was in disbelief and had to try and listen to more of what they were saying.  I was able to make out bits and pieces of what they were saying and sure enough, my name was mentioned a few times and there was also talk about &amp;quot;banging dudes&amp;quot;.  It makes a little bit of sense now because Dave has always been a pretty touhcy person when he gets drunk but on this night, he was pretty much cuddling with me on a couch in his living room and told me that he though I was hot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it safe to assume that Dave is into me?  What do I do now? How do I bring this up?  I&amp;#39;d love to hook up with Dave but I would more importantly like to help him out as a friend.

I'm a college student and I go to a lot of parties. Due to the size of campus, just about everyone knows who's gay and who isn't, and everyone knows everyone else, too. So even if you haven't formally met someone, it's weird to just go up and introduce yourself.

So I’ve been dating this guy for 18 months and last Summer I moved 120 miles and moved in with him. It was only weeks before I moved in that he deleted Grindr, I thought it was really strange that he still had Grindr despite me deleting it months before. He said oh I have a “suicidal friend who needs help.”
He deleted the app and that was the end of it…until now.

He recently started using his old iPod again which I thought was odd seeing as he got rid of all his old devices. Then I noticed he was acting really strange…didn’t come to bed  the same time as me and then I would come back into the living room to get my cup to fill up with water and he’d stash his iPod in his pocket. This went on for several days…

Then one night when I was in bed and he was “joining me in a minute” I decided to download Grindr and look…he was online. This shattered me and I was completely gutted I was shocked and started shaking uncontrollably. When he did come to bed I said I was feeling funny and I’m sure the shakes will go by the morning.

I set up an account on Grindr and pretended to be a student and spoke to him, when I said what you looking for? He said ‘big willies’ 
A couple of weeks ago he left his iPod in his trousers and I went on it. He had Kik and Grindr installed on it and was talking to loads and loads of  guys.

Sex is almost non existent at the moment and anal sex hasn't happened for months which makes me wonder if he is sleeping around?

How do I confront him about it? I want to stay with him and I know I’m completely stupid to want to but I really do love him and gave up everything including my job to move up here and I really thought he felt the same way.

I would also once again apologize for the long wall of text, and as well as the weird format. I'm just kinda not here right now. As in, in my mind not reddit haha.

Okay, welcome to the update. so after feeling really lost pretty much the whole day yesterday. He texted me and said, ""hi"". I responded with a hello back, and he wanted to know how my day was. I told him i felt kinda strange about what had happened and i told him that i was not out. And i told him that if he was looking for a relationship, then i might not be the perfect person for that.

He said that it was fine and still decided to compliment me. I told him that i was still figuring things out with who i am. And that for not i want to remain friends. 

i felt that i had just offended him after all the gestures and just how nice he was the night before. Now i feel like i screwed everything up and i know that i can't just make him wait for me to come out. That's just not fair to him.

Anyways after telling him that, he just responded with one word, which made me freak out and say that I was sorry and he shouldn't hate me. He told me i didn't do anything for him to hate me. And i told him thank for understanding, and that i had been having a few weird weeks lately.

He asked me why it had been so weird, and i told him that i thought i knew what i wanted and now I'm not so sure. And he told me that he hoped things look up for me soon.

Anyways, i feel as i just panicked and just threw everything out of the window with this guy. I told him that i would like to still text him and he said he would be cool with that, and that was all last night. But now i don't know what to say to him? Should i even keep talking to him? Should i tell him to move on? Should i move on? did i fuck everything? What should i do? Life has been really weird lately, and i just feel very depressed.

I felt I wasn't ready, and I was quite damaged by the break-up that sex was the last thing I wanted. On a recent work trip to a big city where there are a lot more gay guys, my apps; Scruff, Grindr, Tinder (so I like apps, what evs!!) were on fire with guys who wanted to hook up and what not, but I had no time. I wasn't going to be in town for very long. However, this gave me quite the ego boost and on my trip back home I realized how fucking horny I was and needed sex, pronto. So my mission was to solve that asap. 

I message this guy who I have been apprehensive about for a while because he's really hot. He responds, we talk for a few days, I invite him over to play video games. When he arrives I mention I had just recently moved into my new place and he's looking around and sees a painting I have on my wall (it's a one of kind) and he's sure he's seen it before, but chalks it up to seeing something similar. We play video games, have conversation and some of the things I say he says he has heard similar things happening to other people (I really should have figured this out when he saw the painting). After video games we decide to have sex. It is amazing, like holy shit, some of the best sex I have ever had. When we finish he notices another painting I have in my room and this elephant figurine on my bedside table and he goes ""Oh my God, your ex is (insert name here)"" and I am shocked beyond belief. I asked him how he knew that and he said he had been in mine and my ex's apartment when we lived together because they are friends. That is why he recognizes the paintings. I never met any of my ex's gay friends, so I had no clue who this guy was. I panic and tell him to please not tell my ex because we're still friends. He agrees, he doesn't want to say anything anyways.

But now what? We want to hang out again because it was good, but I am wondering if I should continue to have sex with my ex's friend. What would you guys do?

TL;DR: Invited a guy over an app to play video games, and we end up having sex. He recognizes paintings I own and figures out who my ex is because they are friends. He had seen these paintings in mine and my ex's apartment. The sex is good and we want to do it again. Is this a good idea? I am friends with my ex, and we have agreed not to say anything to him, but still, I am questioning.

He agrees, he doesn&amp;#39;t want to say anything anyways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now what? We want to hang out again because it was good, but I am wondering if I should continue to have sex with my ex&amp;#39;s friend. What would you guys do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Invited a guy over an app to play video games, and we end up having sex. He recognizes paintings I own and figures out who my ex is because they are friends. He had seen these paintings in mine and my ex&amp;#39;s apartment. The sex is good and we want to do it again. Is this a good idea? I am friends with my ex, and we have agreed not to say anything to him, but still, I am questioning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for any advice Bros.     &lt;/p&gt;

My bf is top, I am bottom. About month ago we decided to go barebacking. After some time he got discharge from his penis.
He got prostatitis, probably due barebacking with me.
I got tested again for STDs/first time i tested before we started dating/. All came back nagative. I did not have any sexual contact with anyone besides my darling. Nor did he, and I trust him.
The thing is he only got tested for gonorrhea and chlamydia.
Few days ago he wanted me to top him. I am quite scared to top because I'm quite submissive. I asked him can I bareback him - he said no.
Now I'm thinking. If I let him bareback me, and lend myself to great risk, giving him insane amount of trust.
Yet he does not want to do same thing for me. Relationships are based on trust and I now feel trust does not go both ways.

a), the sex isn't as plentiful as I wish it could be; and

b), the sex I *have* had is lackluster, to the point where I might wonder how my cat is doing while I'm with a guy.

Therefore, I appeal to this community, which I've come to appreciate over many months, for a resolution to my problem. Why? Well, because as much as Grindr and its army of clones might satisfy the job, I find it doesn't leave much room for intelligence. I'm not trying to be condescending by saying this. I simply find it extremely difficult to have sex with someone who's only gone so far as to tell me that their day was good and that they live in Leaside. That's *not enough*. I also need to know that they don't drink Tim Horton's coffee, and that most of the time, they have a brain.

I can't be the only one who feels this way, and I know there are plenty of Torontonians who frequent this sub. By my calculations, there has to be ones, if not twos of people who are searching for the same thing *at this very moment*. So indulge me. I am a good looking fellow (my mom PLUS others have told me so - that's at least a gold-star certification), who is white, blond, green-eyed, in good shape, and bottom-ish. I say bottom-ish because I find vers is just too in-between. It's like... a bottom with occasional top tendencies.

""Jesus,"" you may say, ""what kind of a weirdo solicits a hookup from this sub?"" To which I reply, ""me."" From the safety of a throwaway, of course.

Please line up in single file.

I was abandoned at age 14 in an airport for several days after my family moved cross country while I was on a trip without telling me, I spent three years in a pray-away camp, my brother and sister had college paid for plus vehicles/insurance/apartments while I was left with nothing but debt they ran up in my name and a ruined credit score at 18. 

I've tried for years to reconcile. One time they planned a family vacation and actually invited me. This was after several cruises and Hawaiian vacations with everyone but me, fully paid by grandparents and parents. I thought it was a chance, they said all reservations and rooms were taken care of, everything. I showed up only to find I was unintentionally invited. I slept on the balcony for three days in winter because I'd rode with a distant uncle and the hotel was booked full. I couldn't even sleep on the couch. 

Through it all my sister has been decent to me and supportive off and on. She is easily influenced by my mother, so there have been rough patches but she's always kept in touch. 

I was invited to her wedding, but turned out she told me the wrong date. I was invited to see my brother ship out to Afghanistan, oops, wrong date again, she was distracted and worried. Always an excuse. I found out she was pregnant about three months in, and have tried to keep in contact regularly every week or so to check on her since its her first. 

Last two weeks I knew it was close but didn't hear from her. I text her a few days ago and she assured me ""Don't worry, I'll tell you and I want you there!"" Sounds great, I told her I'd come the next day so there was no drama with the other family on her big day. 

I was looking through FB today and lo and behold there's all these pictures of the family and a new baby. Congratulations from all these people, coworkers, friends, distant relatives. I had no idea. No messages, no calls, no texts. 

I messaged ""Did you have your baby?"" because she also has a close friend due on her same date. No response, just an immediate deletion of the question. I found out through coworkers who know her that yes she did have her baby this week. 

I don't know what to feel. I thought I'd come to terms with having no family, but I honestly thought I had my sister still. I know the evil bitch that calls herself my mother was there and surely had plenty to say, but she could have at least text me a heads up. I would have been fine with that. But now I've missed every major event in her life and there's just no more excuses to be made. 

I feel like shit. I can't even put a word on it; anger, sadness, bitterness, I don't even know. Just shit. 

How do you deal with this? They've never met any boyfriend of mine, they have no idea who I am anymore, they've never given me a chance since I left the camp years ago. They say horrible things about me in a small town where I hear it, have tried to ruin my professional reputation, have destroyed any possible relationship with extended family. They can't just leave me alone but they don't want anything to do with me either. I don't get it. 

All I've done is be who I am. Why does that mean I have to be completely and totally alone? How does a person move on from this? 

Any advice is appreciated. Sorry for the long rant. I have no one to let this out on, it's just you Reddit. Thanks for giving me someone to listen.
