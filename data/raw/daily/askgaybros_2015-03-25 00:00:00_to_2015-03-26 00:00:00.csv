Just in case you're out there, mystery guy, even if it's just to say you're not interested or you're taken or whatever, it was at the Brick House Tavern and Tap in Louisville, Kentucky.  If you can see this, would you want to go out for coffee or something (I've only been on one date in my life so I not real original with date ideas lol)?

I know it's a slim chance that he'll even be on this sub, but it'd be worth it if he does see it, and if he doesn't maybe I'll work up the courage to just walk in and ask him (assuming he's even working) and just take the embarrassment if I get rejected.

So here I am. Sitting in a San Francisco cafe thinking about myself, love, and the overwhelming, nearly immobilizing, limitless possibilities of my future. To give you some context, only months ago I thought my life was set. I had an amazing career, fulfilling out of work activities, and after 8  incredible years, I was standing hand in hand with my high school sweetheart — the love of my life. 
One day, December 12th to be exact, I took a half day of work to go home early and spend some time with my sweetie. It was his last day in town before he flew back home for the holidays and I figured Id surprise him with some lunch and some quality time before he left. Now you can imagine, from the title of this post and from what seems like the context of this story, I came to our apartment to see my whole reality shattered.
I can’t tell you why I took off work early, or even why I sped home, or even why I tiptoed up the steps to our apartment — but i did. And when I cracked open the door I came in to find the love of my life completely naked with a stranger I had never seen before. Everything in me went numb and I can only attribute it to a stroke of God as to how everyone was able to leave that apartment unscathed. But it did. 
My first thought was not to break up. It was damage control. It was to immediately start asking the right questions and understanding what happened and making a game plan to recovery. And he obliged. 
What evolved was months of therapy, crying and the eventual unfolding that the incident I walked in on was by no means an anomaly or a momentary stroke of weakness. For years, particularly this past one, my partner has cheated on me with over a dozen partners with whom he met on Grindr. 
It almost seems like an impossible nightmare that I can’t seem to escape. For months, if not longer, I had committed to the idea of buying him a home, of raising kids with him, and most recently, growing old with one another. But here I am, in a cafe in San Francisco, pouring my thoughts out onto this blank word doc because the person who was once the repository for all of my secrets and thoughts is indeed a person I do not know at all; a jerk, a monster, and a master manipulator who seamlessly juggled multiple guys while never once providing and inkling of infidelity.
While I was angry at first that he would dare bring someone into my home, in a strange way it seems to have been my saving grace. He wasn’t going to stop and indeed he admitted he didn’t know how to. And in a strange way, as much as I want to hate him, as much as i want to punch him in the fucking face, there is also a part of me that feels at a loss and intrinsically hard-wired to love him. He was my first love and my first everything. And while I know that at age 26, Im in no means at the end of my rope, apart of me just feels exceptionally broken at this thing that I worked so hard on that seemed to have failed right before my eyes. Like a huge estate with a termite problem, I had to watch my home crumble before my eyes. And while I know that I am not my relationship and that this experience must have happened for a reason, I can’t help but feel that this lesson is something that I never wanted to learn. This is an experience that i don’t think anyone at all should have to go through. And ironically, I know that at the end of the day, the only thing that will heal me…is love.
