It's only been a year that I settled down in a safe zone. Back where I used to live, I had a secret relationship with a guy (it was my first relationship) and it was amazing to find a bro similar to me in the hellhole I was at. The relationship wasn't the best tho, as we'd meet up secretly and the next day at school pretend like nothing between us since, well, you guys know why.

One day, I was heading back from school and I called him to check why he didn't attend. No answer. I find out after a long time from his best friend's father, who has connections,helped sneaking my bf and his family outside back to their hometown, as his father was a Colonel and he was threatened by the rebels in the area.

Just yesterday, I found him on Facebook after a long search. I made sure it was him and I contacted him. He recognized who I am, but not sure if what we were. We talked and kept up with each other, he claims he's made half a mil Syrian Pounds in the last year, which is around 2650$. And that he wants to get a house and get married in the next couple years (Think about marriage in Syria, roll it up in your head... get what he meant?). I asked him whether he found someone and he replied with yes and didn't mention if it was a man or a woman (his status say he's in a relationship but doesn't say with whom. But there's a girl who's a lot on his profile. Safe to assume yet?). Also his tone while chatting was bizarre at best for to people who used to roll together and one of them disappeared without a trace! He was more robotic than my username, replying to each question like he's in an investigation. Nothing deep!

Anyways, my point is not that he found someone or that he doesn't seem to be the person who he I used to know ( I mean I changed a bit in these circumstances even tho I have a mind set that no one changes. They either develop or destruct). But it was an experience that I had with him that I am not sure I'll get in this community. Especially that from my experience so far, the homosexual communities in Syria can use each other or tell on to each other's parents to get what they want (Yes, I said something bad about gay people and didn't over glorify the image of homosexuals. Problem?) so one has to be very cautious while communicating if they wanna stay alive, literally.

So what lesson should I carry on with me? That the odds of finding someone very like me here are negative 89%? That I should move on like he claims he has? Or work my ass to get the fuck out of here? y'know, like what Meredith Gray said: ""Sometimes, you just need to get outta town.""

Got into a conversation with some coworkers and somebody who thought it odd people were coming out in high school.

I countered that I knew I was sexually interested in girls when I was in 4th grade, and most of us agreed on that age or maybe a year or two more as being normal.

I like being right, but I can see thing going the other way.  Maybe I thought I was straight before I actually was because society told me that is what I should be, and I was pretending to be interested in girls to seem more mature than I actually was.

You are forewarned.

I've never been good at opening up. It's not that I don't try, just generally when I do I become incoherent or mute. I can't find the right words to say, or sort through my feelings in a way that I can express to someone else without sounding fucking mad. But here goes.

I'm a 22 year old bi guy with Cystic Fibrosis and while I'm definitely sexually attracted to girls, I think I could only really love another guy. I'm scared of getting close to anyone, of the vulnerability that comes from letting people in. I'm out, in a way, people know that I like guys, my parents are aware and everything. I'll tell someone if they ask, but I don't advertise and I'm masculine enough that people generally don't think to ask. I've never really felt compatible with the GLBTQ (or whatever the fuck) community, I have nothing against pride or anything like that, and I have the utmost respect for people who can be out and be comfortable with themselves. They are stronger than I am.

I suppose I should actually explain why the fuck I'm posting something. I feel like I'm starting to fall for another guy, a similarly discreet bi guy who is sort of new to gay relationships in general. It's happening really fast, we had gone to school together and sort of knew each other but hung with different crowds. We ended up reconnecting on grindr (yes, I know) and talked a few times before recognising each other. We decided to meet for a date, and ended up grabbing dinner at a restaurant. It was the typical sort of discreet date, we kept the topic not sexual, talked about people from school, shit like that. When we went to leave he lingered a bit and asked if I wanted to hang in his car a bit and I was feeling it, so I said okay.

I don't think I'm a particularly great kisser or anything, and kissing has always been pretty much just foreplay for me. Maybe sort of a tease, sometimes just because it seems polite and I want to communicate that I'm enjoying someone's company. Nothing I've ever gotten too excited about on it's own.

Then I kissed this guy and I fucking felt something, something real, something powerful, something amazing. I felt my pulse quicken. I got butterflies. I saw stars. I was over the moon, the rainbow, the sun. I was somewhere or something else entirely. Guy had lips like fucking Poison Ivy, and I had a fucking fever, lol. There was no like over the pants dick rubbing or anything either It was just his lips on mine, our tongues fighting in our mouths, our hands around each others heads. We kissed for awhile, and he seemed equally excited, I felt like he was there, wherever the hell I was, right with me.

Then someone walked close the car, we pulled back, and I thought it best that I leave, because I felt like if I didn't go then I wouldn't be able to leave. I've never been so fucking spun from a kiss, I got in my car and drove 2 minutes to a certain prominent coffee place to get a coffee to steady myself (caffeine doesn't make me jittery, sort of just evens me out). I pulled out my phone to pay for my drink and saw that he had already texted me, ""That was pretty fucking amazing"". We ended up texting a bit talking about how the kiss had felt for both of us, we both kept telling each other how awesome it felt, and how we'd both wanted more. Turns out he had stopped at a friends place close by to grab a beer because he was so shaken up too.

We started texting constantly. The next day was Super Bowl Sunday, and neither of us had any plans. My parents (we both still live at home) were out so I had the place to myself and I invited him over to watch the game. We had been talking all day trying to figure out some way to see each other, so when my parents left to go to a party I jumped on the chance. He came over and we didn't even up really watching the game, and I fucking love football. It was the best Super Bowl ever for me, and I fucking hate the Patriots.

Afterwards when my parents were going to come home we drove around a bit and talked, picked up some McDonald's and chilled together. We parked a few places and made out and messed around in the car a bit more. We ended up parking near my house for like an hour, just kissing. I didn't want to get out of the car, and he didn't want me to either. But it was getting late, I had to be up in the morning and so did he. So we split again, still texting, still communicating.

Monday we went and got wings together and leched out on Hooters chicks together. He gave me shit for checking out our waitress' ass. He invited me to go to the Caribbean (Bahamas) on a family trip him and his parents were contemplating (he works for an airline, he gets cheap tickets and they were thinking about either heading there or to another city up north to see family, his dad decided he didn't want to spend the money on the Caribbean though, so that's not happening now.) We ended up making out in the parking lot, before driving back to the secluded place near my house to kiss more. It was getting harder and harder to walk away from him. I'd pull away fighting with myself to get away, and he'd pull me back. He'd put his forehead against mine and we'd just softly kiss and share each others breath. It felt so fucking right. I look him in the eyes and he's staring at me and we're smiling and I'm happy. I think he's happy too.

We meet up again last night to see a movie and eat cheap Chinese. We eat off each other's plates. I can't keep my hands off of him in the theatre, and he won't stop touching me either. The people sitting a couple rows made a noise and we broke apart for a bit, but ended up right back to where we were. We kissed as we walked out of the auditorium, behind everyone else.

He drove me home, and we went back to the place by my house again. We kissed and I told him that I really liked him. He told me that he liked me too, and that he was scared. I wanted him to come inside, I wanted him in my bed, in my arms, not in his car. He kept asking if we should do it, about how he didn't want me to do something if he thought I'd get shit from my parents. But I didn't invite him in. We looked at each other and I said ""this fucking sucks"" and he agreed. I asked him if he wanted more than just this. He said he was scared again, afraid that even if we were discreet people would suspect shit if we were always together. He teared up a bit, and he looked at his phone, I think so I didn't see. He told me he hated me leaving, and that it felt like saying goodbye to family for a long time. I said okay, and he said he wanted another kiss before I left for the night, and I gave it to him. They get better every time, but that was the best one. I got out of the car and he said he'd see me tomorrow. He texted me when he got home, I asked if he was alright, he assured me he was and said he'd text me in the morning.

I'm going to give you some brief back story about myself, about why I'm so afraid of being in a relationship. I know a lot of gay guys have crushes or feelings for their straight friends in high school. It's a rough deal, for sure. And it was true for me, I was crazy about my best friend in high school. We went through some crazy shit together, issues with my health, my drug problems, he had a minor altercation with the law. But we were always extremely close, and I felt safe with him. After we graduated, I opened up and told him how I really felt about him one night I was drunk over the phone. He texted me that he needed some space, and then never talked to me again.

I was devastated. I started abusing shit harder, wanting to be fucked up all the time. My health deteriorated. I was in and out of the hospital, both because of the worsening CF and the psychiatric issues I was having. I attempted to overdose twice. I lost everyone I was close to, I shut everyone out, and since I was always sort of an introvert people didn't reach out to me. November 2013 I got really sick, spent most of the winter in the hospital, including a two month stint between February and April 2014. I had to have a thoracotomy to repair a paralyzed diaphragm. I was pretty sure I was going to die, and I think everyone else was too. They ended up releasing me after I'd healed up enough, even though my lung function wasn't improving because I didn't want to be there in the hospital anymore. I figured I'd rather spend what time I have at home, with my dog, my music, the dignity of privacy, the comfort of my room, and whatever love my family still had for me. Then out of nowhere I rallied, my lung function improved, and I'm in good shape now.

I don't know if maybe I just want to be in love because I've been alone for so long. I've hooked up with people and shit like that, but I don't want just empty transient sex. That's never been for me. I want to love, and to be loved. I'm scared that with my health being the way it is that I'm never going to get to have that feeling, and I want it more than I fucking want anything else. I want to be special to someone, I want to matter. I don't want to die without having that feeling, and I feel like I just got a glimpse of it.

He hasn't texted me back this morning. *Edit - He did end up texting me, although we're keeping the talk very light*

I realise that my situation isn't really special, I don't think stories like mine are uncommon at all. I just want to know how all of you deal with this sort of heartache, this pain, having to live in a world where people don't understand why you are the way you are, being afraid of feeling, paralyzed with a love that you may never get.

Any comments would be appreciated, if you have a story to share or something feel free to post. If you have advice I'd love to hear it, but I think I'm posting this mostly for my own catharsis, and maybe because I just want someone to tell me that it's going to be okay, even though I know it's not. So... lie to me. Tell me that I'm going to be alright and that everyone finds someone. Give me an escape.

Please.

tl;dr I need a fucking hug.

I&amp;#39;m scared that with my health being the way it is that I&amp;#39;m never going to get to have that feeling, and I want it more than I fucking want anything else. I want to be special to someone, I want to matter. I don&amp;#39;t want to die without having that feeling, and I feel like I just got a glimpse of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He hasn&amp;#39;t texted me back this morning. &lt;em&gt;Edit - He did end up texting me, although we&amp;#39;re keeping the talk very light&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realise that my situation isn&amp;#39;t really special, I don&amp;#39;t think stories like mine are uncommon at all. I just want to know how all of you deal with this sort of heartache, this pain, having to live in a world where people don&amp;#39;t understand why you are the way you are, being afraid of feeling, paralyzed with a love that you may never get.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any comments would be appreciated, if you have a story to share or something feel free to post. If you have advice I&amp;#39;d love to hear it, but I think I&amp;#39;m posting this mostly for my own catharsis, and maybe because I just want someone to tell me that it&amp;#39;s going to be okay, even though I know it&amp;#39;s not. So... lie to me. Tell me that I&amp;#39;m going to be alright and that everyone finds someone. Give me an escape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tl;dr I need a fucking hug.&lt;/p&gt;
