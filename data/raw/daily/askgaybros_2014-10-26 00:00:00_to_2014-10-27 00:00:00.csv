First of all, I'd like you to know I'm French. I hope you'll understand me and forgive my mistakes.
I've already shared my story on the NoFap Reddit but I got adviced that I should post here. Here is the first answers I got : www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/2kb3bw/nofap_for_a_21_yo_gay_man/

As the title says, I'm 21 and I'm still virgin. I never really watched any porn but I have MOed while watching hot and handsome muscled guys for many years. Not bodybuilders, it's too much, but well-shaped men, e.g those you can find showing off on Youtube. As far as I can remember, i began MOing when I was 13.

Though, I find some women attractive and/or cute, beautiful, I'd not say I want to fuck them because I'm not that kind of guy but I'd be curious to know how it feels. I kissed 2 girls once each, but both kisses were awkward because I actually don't really how to do...
Besides, I've kind of dated a girl for a few months when I was 19, and she attracted me and had me an erection, but unfortunately nothing happened. Seven months ago, I had a crush on a woman and felt all that kind of feelings when it happens but I didn't desire her. I almost had courage to kiss her, but I felt shy and tired (I partied the night before and felt like it wasn't the good time).

Anyway, I want to NoFap for some time, so I can have an erection naturally. What do you think ? Am I gay, or straight, or bi ? Has anyone experienced what I described or known someone alike me ? How can NoFap help me find a solution ?

Over the summer, I got to know a guy from Facebook, let's call him J, who has identified himself as bisexual. So we hit it off really well, and we met in July and went on a few dates.

It eventually got to a point where I eventually found out he sees himself as a top, but so am I. At that moment, I didn't care much - I was even willing to bottom for him if it means us having sex soon.

But as we go on a couple more dates, he told me he finds intimacy between men ""off-putting"", which includes making out, him giving head and anal sex in general.

The conclusion I got from him was that he is straight, perhaps bi-curious, but definitely not full-on gay *enough* for us to continue going out on dates to eventually be together.

I'm already well over J, but something else has come up. During the summer, I also got to know a few more friends, and one of them is A. A was really attractive at first sight, but I didn't think much because at that time I was already going out with J..

But it turns out that I got closer with A during the summer than I had with J, it got to a point where I actually see A way more often (in a group of friends), than I get to see J.

And um when A learned that I couldn't work things out with J, he sent me a text to tell me everything is gonna be all right &amp; we could hang if it would help me feel better and stuff.. back then I kept thinking he's *really* friendly... I mean he even drew a portrait of me, saying that I ""caught his attention"".

So with much encouragement from my friends, I asked A out on a date  in the beginning of October and I really don't regret it.

We have been going out and texting, and he mentioned he has thought of us being together as a couple before, but it's way too soon to be deciding that at this point of time, which I strongly agreed with. We are going to go on more dates and see if this chemistry between us would continue to stay strong.

But there's this little problem - I think I'm thinking of him too much? He's got final exams in his college during this period so I'm trying not to disturb him much by texting, but it seems like the more I try to control myself by not being a nuisance to him, the more things go on in my head, making me feel really insecure for some reason.. Like I'm not sure if he likes me anymore or something.. it's a really stupid thought I've realized but I'm not sure why I have it in my mind.

It's just, I'm really looking forward to meet him soon and I'm planning to ask him out for a dinner this weekend as a break from his studies but I don't know why I have these feelings of doubt so suddenly.

I'm guessing it's because I'm impatient? Like I dunno, maybe I cannot wait to see him and it's driving me crazy but yeah that's how I feel. I do have a life though; I work Mon-Fri, and I have tons of exercise to do (running, swimming, zumba) so it's not that I have a lot of free time, but I'm thinking of him every second and I really want to know how I can control myself with this situation and basically detach myself from A so that I wouldn't have to feel so obsessive?

Also, I've been thinking about physical intimacy with A... Recently, many of my thoughts include having sex with him and I don't know if he wants it soon lol, because he has mentioned he is trying to hold off sex until he has gotten into a relationship because he has been too wild in the past. I'm also thinking of how to broach the subject to him, and I'm not sure if it will make me look like a sex-obsessed person or someone who only wants to get into his ass...

So I guess I just really want to know how to be a better and supportive person now to him since he's probably under some stress from the exams. FYI, I'm 22 and A is 21.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey fellow bros, so I&amp;#39;ve got a situation going on now &amp;amp; it&amp;#39;s quite a long story, so please bear with me...&lt;/p&gt;

So I came out close enough to a year ago. It was for a stupid reason (this guy I thought was straight is gay and I that revelation had me develop a mad crush on him) but aside from that it turned out to be much more beneficial than I ever thought. I’ve accepted who I am for quite a while but actually being out about it had a HUGE impact on my confidence levels. 

However looking back I feel like such an idiot for not coming out sooner. Right now it is probably my biggest regret. I’m 21 and I feel like I’ve missed out on so many opportunities for personal development. Like because of the initial uncertainty of who I was I have never been in a real relationship. I’m someone who wants to think of everything and do everything right the first time- especially when it comes to people. So this lack of experience in relationship stuff just is this personal wall I have to climb to even just ask someone that I care about out. I guess its mostly the sexual stuff that scares me when it comes to fucking stuff up because it is such an in the moment and intimate process and I don’t know if I trust myself enough to “do it right”. On the emotional side I like to think I’m okay (though maybe this whole spiel illustrates points against that) and its the emotional stuff I really want from a relationship (though physical side seems superrrrr rad as well). But I feel like I’m gonna fuck up the physical stuff which is critical to making a relationship both enjoyable and emotional.

How do you get better at something that you know little about? Practice. But how am I supposed to practice something that is so closely tied to people? Am I just supposed to see people as sexual training dummies? Seeing people as one-dimensional like that is morally disgusting to me...even though I still do it when I notice damn sexy legs and butts. But thinking and acting are two different things. How can I not feel like a shitty person by getting with someone and knowing that they are probably going to have a bad experience? But if I want to develop myself then should I be thinking so much about other people or should I just see them as a means to an end? Should I just say fuck it to everything I believe in and just do what might be best for me? 

Its really frustrating because I feel like these are all thoughts I should have been having in middle and high school but I was too caught up in the uncertainty of who I was to really think about other things. Now I feel underdeveloped and incompetent. I feel like a child and its frustrating because I feel like no one deserves to be with someone who doesn’t know what they are doing. People shouldn’t be the subjects of my mistakes. How do you reconcile a need for personal growth with a deep concern for other people? 

TL;DR- How do I sexually develop myself without hurting other people?

But I feel like I’m gonna fuck up the physical stuff which is critical to making a relationship both enjoyable and emotional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you get better at something that you know little about? Practice. But how am I supposed to practice something that is so closely tied to people? Am I just supposed to see people as sexual training dummies? Seeing people as one-dimensional like that is morally disgusting to me...even though I still do it when I notice damn sexy legs and butts. But thinking and acting are two different things. How can I not feel like a shitty person by getting with someone and knowing that they are probably going to have a bad experience? But if I want to develop myself then should I be thinking so much about other people or should I just see them as a means to an end? Should I just say fuck it to everything I believe in and just do what might be best for me? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its really frustrating because I feel like these are all thoughts I should have been having in middle and high school but I was too caught up in the uncertainty of who I was to really think about other things. Now I feel underdeveloped and incompetent. I feel like a child and its frustrating because I feel like no one deserves to be with someone who doesn’t know what they are doing. People shouldn’t be the subjects of my mistakes. How do you reconcile a need for personal growth with a deep concern for other people? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR- How do I sexually develop myself without hurting other people?  &lt;/p&gt;

I met a guy a week ago, who has everything I look for in a man. He's masculine, sweet, a bit more extroverted than I am, but not too much. He's normal weight, has beautiful eyes, loves running. He's mastered casual touch. I love the way he treated me. 

In my 38 years, I had never fallen for a guy so quickly. We had incredible conversations, where we bared our souls. But that's the problem. We started telling each other about our experiences, and I definitely have a lot more mileage than he has. 

I've had to battle with depression and I have to admit, I was a bottom feeder not too long ago. I thought I didn't deserve a beautiful hot guy to be my BF. So that made me do a lot of things sexually that I probably shouldn't have done, including some kinky stuff, and worse, infidelity. In the several hours-long conversations we had over the week, I told him all these things, and he shared his secrets with me as well. 

While he said at first that he appreciated the honesty, and that this was all in the past, and that it was ok. Today he suddenly told me that he couldn't sleep thinking about the things I'd told him, and that it was best if we ended it right there.

What should I do? Have I ruined myself for LTR-oriented guys?

I like the person I am right now, but I know I can't be the same person if I start working towards ignoring the bad things; I'll just stop caring if I can't feel like myself in general, since I'll basically feel like I can't be comfortable around people if I start repressing myself.

&lt;p&gt;I like the person I am right now, but I know I can&amp;#39;t be the same person if I start working towards ignoring the bad things; I&amp;#39;ll just stop caring if I can&amp;#39;t feel like myself in general, since I&amp;#39;ll basically feel like I can&amp;#39;t be comfortable around people if I start repressing myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you think I&amp;#39;m okay the way I am?&lt;/p&gt;
