Just writing this so someone out there can give me some piece of mind. I have booked a doctor's appointment for tomorrow before anyone worries.

So over the last few day's I've had that 'kicked in the balls' pain in my epididymis. The pain is mild, not constant and changes from one ball to the other. The balls themselves are fine.
So this morning I go for a piss and notice my left ball is twice as big as normal and higher than normal.

Bros who have nut complaints, give me some good news?

Update:
Okay bros. Something I forgot to add was I've been engaging in nofap and my man has been ill so I had basically not ejaculated for a full week. After writing this I jerked off twice just to see if it were nofap related. Well by yesterday evening my balls were back to normal and no complaints down there continued.

He is younger than me and i don't see him that much. Also i don't have idea if he is is gay-bi or no.  I used to chat with him a little in PS4 but we stoped playing  so i have no way to talk to him. How can i befriend him? Is it weird to just talk to him over facebook? Do i just fuck everything and get to the point to telling him that i want to hang out with him? 

His brother knows that i'm gay so any personal approach could be akward. LOL.

UPDATE: i talked to him a little bit over facebook chat. Normal stuff, i told him that if he goes to our school gym and he told me that he wants to but doesn't have anyone to drive him back home so i kinda volunteer to do so ( so obvious )  i have hopes that he will go jaja.

So after Christmas I started talking to this guy from OKC, lets call him Jake.  Jake is five years younger and is cute, charming and someone I could see myself in a relationship with.

Since messaging Jake on OKC, we’ve been messaging each other daily (quite a lot actually), then started talking on the phone almost every night since.  We agreed to meet up for a quick bite a week ago and clicked; I don’t think I’ve felt this comfortable with someone before.  It sounds like a cliché and is probably my wishful thinking of the new situation, but I feel like I’ve known him in forever.

Jake thought we clicked as well and said he’d like to see me again, to which I agreed to.  The problem is the distance between us; its a three hour drive.  In any case, we both have said we would make the effort so Jake is planning on driving down my area for a few nights.

At first I was on board and did not really hesitate until a friend of mine put things into perspective and said it that it was weird to have Jake stay with me for a few days after just one date.  I thought the same and shared this with Jake and said he is happy to go on another date before spending that much time with me at mine.  Do you think I’m rushing this?

I should point out, I’m rather new to this despite being 29 years old.  I’ve never been in a relationship and have not done anything with a guy (yes I’m a pathetic loser).  We did talk about sex and he said he’s happy to cuddle and take things slow; and that we didn’t have to have sex.  Jake was very upfront about this.  Now, I did not tell him I’m very new to this but have said I’m inexperienced.  Do you think I should tell him I’ve not done anything at all with a guy in terms of sex?

On another note, I have body image issues and don’t have the biggest dick.  I don’t know if this is a deal breaker but should I be upfront about it?  I was circumcised as a child and I think there is some residual foreskin there that I’m really self conscious about. :S

Any input or feedback is greatly appreciated.

TL;DR – met guy from OKC, planning on him spending a few nights over at mine.  New to guys and relationships.  Should I be upfront and honest?

I'm 25 btw.

So I was driving to work this morning and stuck in traffic when I got to thinking. Maybe I've been wrong all this time. I know I'm not straight because I'm not attracted or interested in women at all. But after the 100% failure rate in relationships with men that I've had, and the complete disinterest I have in dating, I've come to a fork in the road. Am I really gay? My reasoning is as follows.

1. I have never been in love. I've never had a crush, or felt anything more than a momentary lust for a man. I'm not kidding, the male face and body appeals to me on a generic level, but at no time have I ever envisioned myself being with any guy I've ever met. I have dated 3 men (all less than 3 months) and all ended poorly because I had no interest in the beginning. I thought I would feel something if I kept with it, but that never materialized. I know this is wrong because it's a way of leading the guy on, but in my most messed up moments I justify it by thinking that the feelings of affection will just come around naturally. They haven't.

2. I have never had an enjoyable sexual encounter. I have had full on sex with 8 different guys and oral with about 15. I have never been glad I did it. Either it ends with me going limp or I have to strain with all my might to finish myself off. No matter what I feel regretful it happened. You might think, why did he have sex when he wasn't attracted to these people? The reason is because I've been thinking it would come along naturally, that maybe it just wasn't the right time or something. So I kept trying. 

3. When guys try to chat me up or compliment me, it's a total turn off. The most surefire to get me to not want to talk to you is to come on to me. It makes me fill up with dread and anxiety because I cannot reciprocate the feelings you might have for me. Cue the guilt about misleading the guy if I respond the wrong way. This has basically ruined friendships for me and I'm sure has made people think I'm a real jerk when in reality I think I'm just messed up.

4. I have one of the lowest sex drives of anyone I've ever met. I would be literally 100% okay if I never had sex again. I jack off maybe once a week if I have time, otherwise I've gone for over a month without even thinking about it.

So there you go. After living life as a gay man for 7 years I'm starting to doubt it's for me. I actually like the stereotypical scene, clubs, drinks, drag queens and underwear parties but aside from that, nothing else interests me. This is causing me a lot of turmoil and pain and I'm not sure what to do about it. Maybe I'm mostly asexual? Can anyone relate? Any advice?

**tl;dr** Be 25. Don't like girls at all. Attracted to men SOMETIMES. Never had a crush/been in love. All relationships fail due to my lack of interest. Never had sex I enjoyed. Hate it when men compliment/flirt with me. Very low sex drive. Feeling really shitty. What do?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long post ahead. I&amp;#39;m 25 btw.&lt;/p&gt;

What makes you a person? Your interests? Your friends? I feel like I don't have any, that I only steal from and imitate people. And friends I don't have because I never learned how to talk to people because I was shy and awkward. Now I have social phobia and it's even harder, to the point where I've almost given up. Why would people be interested in me? My ex boyfriend once told me he felt like I was imitating him and that he didn't like it, that he wasn't a good role model for me and cut contact. But I've always added things I like in other people to myself before but if that isn't okay and makes people mad what is? What are things that I can call my own then? The only thing that I can think of that makes me a person are my anxieties, my depression, my low self esteem and self hate. I hate it when people tell me to be myself because I have no idea who I am. It feels like with every person I meet I try to be like them. It's so very confusing. I don't know how to be a person and I don't understand life. I really hope this was coherent enough for you to understand, I'm not good at expressing myself at all.

He was everything to me, I felt so close to him - he was the only person that i ever felt truly comfortable around; nothing ever happened between us and he moved away and we lost contact. 

He popped up a few times in the next thirteen years, always when i least expected it and always managed to mess my head for a while. Throughout all my experiences since he has always been in the background of my mind. Even through some emotionally turbulent and intense relationships, his memory still lingered.

So last Monday (eight days ago) i had an email saying he would be in town for the weekend and wanted to know if i fancied dinner. My logical side said 'stay away' but the heart took over and i agreed to meet him, accepting the inevitably head fuck that would surly follow. I won't bore you with details of the dinner, but essentially, he came out to me. After a rather surreal chat, long story short, we went back to mine and had the best sex i have ever had for about six hours (that is a long time for me!). It was fun, it was natural, there was no embarrassment; at times tender, intense and funny!

And now he has left again and I am feeling like a love-sick teenager. I am so terrified of getting hurt, and with the strength of my feelings it is a definite possibility - but i think part of my problem is I don't pursue guys. Not wanting to sound boo-hoo and all that shit, but I can't see why someone would want me, and i don't want to turn into some psycho stalker. 

Bros, don't want to lose something because i am scared, but i don't want to fuck my head up.

Sorry for the long winded story!
