Whether or not this is read by anyone, I often find it therapeutic to type my thoughts out, and after a lot of procrastination, I thought this would be a good medium to do so. I would definitely appreciate my post being read but it very well may be an incoherent jumble, so I'm more than happy for you to turn back now. 

As I said, I really have no idea where I want go with this. What I think I'll begin with is some basic information about me - I'm 15 (almost 16) and I accepted that I was (and am) gay earlier this year after a ""long"" internal battle over my sexuality. I've put long in inverted commas because while for me a couple of years felt like an extremely long period of time, I know that many others struggle with it for much longer. I originally thought I was bisexual, and this isn't meant to be an attack on bisexuals in any shape or form, but I think  labelled myself this way because in the beginning I couldn't even consider being gay an option. I've written about this in much greater detail on a different account which my very intelligent self has forgotten the password to. I'm not one of those people who always knew that they were gay. On the contrary actually - I was very confident I was straight when I was younger and when I started to realise I was attracted to the same sex, the safest way for me to understand it was to say I was straight and it was a phase. Soon, as I became more self-aware, I said I was bicurious. Eventually, I settled on bisexual. For a while I felt comfortable with this label, but as time went on, I almost felt a niggling in the back of the head. At the back of my mind, I always knew I was gay but I struggled to let go of whatever opposite sex attraction I had. I still wanted a conventional life, with a wife and biological kids. Anyway, I'll skip forward a bit.

The thing I've found a bit odd, when I believed I was bisexual I was perfectly content with keeping it to myself. But ever since I've realised that I'm gay, I've felt a needto tell someone grow and grow. I've really gotten to the point where I don't know how much longer I can keep this all to myself. And what's stopping me? I honestly don't know. I go to a school, which despite being religious, the overwhelming majority is fully supporting of gay people. I know all of my friends would be extremely accepting, except for one who would be eventually fine but may have some issues coming to terms with it. My mom too, I know, would have absolutely no problem with me being gay and would be fully supportive. Despite all of this, I just can't get myself to make the leap. I feel like I need to tell even one person, but that too is causing me anxiety. Who do I choose? And how will they react? 

I'm not sure whether to add it or if it's an irrelevant detail, but I do also suffer from pretty severe anxiety which I'm sure is impacting me in all this. I'm putting random information here, but I'm not really sure where else to put it. What I think has made me finally type this out happened last week, but that's unfortunately depressed me quite a bit. In class the other day, we were discussing homosexuality with a teacher I really liked and respected. It wasn't out of place for the class as it was an ethics and religion type of class, and I didn't really think her views would be much different, but it kind of depressed me to hear them actually being said. She shares the view of ""hate the sin, love the sinner"" and believes homosexuality is not a choice, but still wrong to act on. What I think upset me the most though, was that she tied in her arguments a lot with pedophilia and ""sexual deviation"". But what I took from this was not the fact that it was her who shared these beliefs, but that someone can completely disapprove of the way I want to live my life without knowing anything about me. The fact that someone can believe that I'm a good person but still completely disapprove of something beyond my control has now become a reality for me.  

Now for the quintessential gay teenager's predicament - I do feel quite alone. I don't know a single gay person in real life and I feel like a large part of me has been kept hidden. In many ways I feel stuck in place, almost just waiting for my life to begin once school ends and I can go study abroad (that's my dream, at least). 

I know none of this is unique to myself, but I felt that I needed to get this off my chest. If you've read this, I really appreciate it. Have a great day.

I'm 22 yo and i'm feeling desperate. I came out a few months ago in order to find love at last after being completely alone all of these years. I hadn't have much luck finding a connection with someone so that means the right now i'm a 22 yo virgin :( I could go and fix this separately but I have a few major insecurities that are the main cause of this post:

although I don't consider myself ugly and I have a slim body structure (1.83m and 70kg) I have this crippling fear that everyone who will sleep with me will be bummed out. First if all I am hairy in the lower part of my body, I myself prefers less hair on the ass and groin. Second and most important is that i suffer from light acne on my butt (I don't think I will only bottom but I think it's a drag for everybody) it would be somewhat fine unless it left little dark spot where the acne has been. It's not a catastrophe down there, it sums up to about 10 spots all over but compared to a normal butt it's just not appealing at all. I've gone through a cosmetic operation where most of the spots were removed but some new spots appeared about a month later :/ this had made very insecure about hitting on guys I like because I can't get over the fact that they will probably be disappointed, for a relationship and even for a hookup. I don't them to compromise over me and feel like they have to overlook parts of me, mostly if I will bottom. I may sound superficial, I really prefer a long relationship over hookups, but still I think loving your partner's body is still important. Right now i feel stuck, I take some measures to stop the increasing in the number of spots (and hopefully disappearance of the existing) , but right now I feel so unsexy that it has really has put a halt on the progress I've made by coming out. I want someone i can share my life with so bad... Hope you can give me some advice on getting out of this situation... 


Here some background about myself: I came in terms with my sexuality years ago but only started to feel more comfortable about it a year ago. I came out about 7 months ago to all of my friends, family and coworkers. The reason why I did it in the first place was because I felt so lonely (in terms of love and relationship). I'm that kind of a person who can't keep away a huge thing like a relationship from the people in my life [it's not my morals but more of the fact that i'm a terrible lier and it's burdens the way I feel]). Anyway... I had no gay friend and almost no way to meet new gay friends. Several months after i came out i started going to the older group of the lgbt youth group in my country (18-23) it was really fun and I made friends with a decent amount of people (mostly lesbians and one gay guy I'm not attracted to) that I keep close contact with. Other then that I only went to a gay club once (this past Tuesday) to a drag show (which was awesome, but not the place to meet people). Right now I'm on the outside of the gay scene, not that I care so much because I'm feel like a little different from the typical type who goes to those parties, but It's still a decent place to meet guys so I think I'll keep going there. Dating apps are a problem to me because of my insecurities, I don't what to feel like I'm tricking a guy and in the end he doesn't get what he anticipated.

In case this is a stress thing here's some history: about a year ago my parents kicked me out of the house for being gay.  After that I was homeless up until only a few months ago. And now I take anxiety medicine and have regular panic attacks.

Also medically: I have blood in my stool sometimes and it hurts a lot to shit, but when I saw a doctor about it, he tested for every std known to man and it wasn't that. He later said it was probably stress related since it started happening after my parents kicked me out.

Basically I don't know why I have this problem, and it scares me cause so many people in the gay community wouldn't be able to put up with not having anal sex. I guess I'm screwed.

He had a girlfriend in high school for about four months. We're in college and have been dating for over a year.

He absolutely will not allow any form of penetration. No fucking, no being fucked, no blowing, no being blown... nothing. He says he thinks it's gross, basically. He's pretty much into making out, but he did that with his girlfriend even though he doesn't identity as straight, so... 

I don't think it's just me, either. I know for a fact that I make him rock hard, so it's not like I don't turn him on. In fact, his boxers have been wet from precum just from kissing for a few minutes. And he seems to like my mouth enough to stick his tongue into it quite ferociously. 

Naturally, I'm confused as to why he wouldn't want to be sucked. It is his body and his choice, of course. I only want to understand it, since we're both in this relationship. I'm coming here because he doesn't really seem to have a lot of thoughts on it. Maybe there's more under the surface?

If you're homosexual, then, by definition, you're sexual ly attracted to people of the same sex, which would mean he's sexually attracted to males. How can he be *sexually* attracted to males if he's put off by the thought of any kind of *sex* with males and only really does what he did with girls, despite him identifying as not straight? I don't understand that. If a lesbian claimed to have briefly dated a guy out of confusion, but then was grossed out by gay sex with her girlfriend and only did what she had previously done with her boyfriend, then how is she any more gay than straight?

&lt;p&gt;Help on meeting guys?? I tried my university&amp;#39;s LGBT group but it&amp;#39;s for people who&amp;#39;ve just come out...more therapy and activism than activity and fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: literally every gay dude I&amp;#39;ve been on a date with bitches about San Antonio&amp;#39;s gay community. Every single one. Even the macho ones lol, I think there might be something off about our city.&lt;/p&gt;

Probably not the correct place to ask this, and i'm sorry if it isn't. Throwaway account because i'd like to keep my identity safe so I can inquire about this freely and without reserve. 

I've been in the same classes with this guy for more than a year. And as far as I remember, he has always been intimate with me and only me (not even slightly like with his best friend, at all). I'd also like to mention that we're not really ""friends."" He would often try to get to know me better, not in the usual way, but never attempted to keep contact for long periods of time. I'll expand on what I meant by that he's intimate: He's very touchy. He does that for no one else. He likes to hug just out of the blue and would put his hand on my shoulder(s), waist, or ""accidentally"" touch my hand (which sometimes stays that way for several seconds). But, over time, he has grown even more intimate. I only began to question because of that. He would try ""air kiss"" (from cheek to cheek). He would sit anywhere available near or behind/beside me and often during lunch break times (if I sat near him) he would get closer and try to keep me sitting there (either by starting a conversation or just straight-up asking me to stay). Also, he used to steal glances, which he now does for longer periods of time than before and recently he would just keep making eye contact (with occasional smiles) even if I notice him doing it. The thing is, I have never put this much thought into all that until, last day of this week, he hugged me and said ""See you next week!"" with a smile. I have no idea what to make of all that, and I'm confused. 

I should probably give a background on sexuality and relationships in general regarding this. I live in a place (which i'd rather not name) where homosexuality is extremely secretive. Relationships here (boys with girls only, of course) are something we're pretty open about with our peers (not with family at all), but homosexuality is a complete no-no. I can't ask him about it because naturally he would deny it and there's a possibility that he could not be actually ""into me"" (he also, or so he says, had a girlfriend or two before). I can never make such a move. It seems that if anyone were to make a move, that would be him only. I thought about telling him to be honest with me, but we're not close friends and telling him that out of the blue would be weird. I also considered befriending him, but i'm not sure if that's the right move. 

I need help. Am I picking up the wrong signals? Did I misunderstand? Should I expect anything from what he last said, or is it just another one of his ""signals"" or ""methods"" (that is, if they really are)? 

**Also, I need help from your experience and personal opinions. What if he finally confessed to me (assuming that he *is* into me)? I know that I can occasionally be a mocking/fairly honest person and I fear that I might hurt him. If he does decide to finally tell me if he is, that would take a lot of courage and I don't know what to respond with to make sure I don't hurt him.**

I'm very, very sorry for the length of this post. Also, excuse me for any spelling/grammatical mistakes I may have made. English is not my native language. 

Thanks a lot, in advance! 

**EDIT: Thanks, everyone! It seems that, based on all the advice i've gotten, i've come to a conclusion. I can't be direct with him about suspecting that he likes me because it's not a feasible option, so my best approach would be to make it clear that I do not feel comfortable with his flirtatious/touch-y behavior (in the most understanding way possible). I guess i'll try and see how it goes!**","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I apologize for the length of this post, but &lt;em&gt;please&lt;/em&gt; read it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
