So basically I'm out to my family and perfectly fine with my sexuality. I have a bro 2 years older and we are really close, he was really supportive when I came out, I knew he would be cos he has a close friend who is also gay. This is the guy I can't get out of my head.

He is awesome, smoking hot, athletic and everything i'd go for. When I came out about 8 months ago now, he got super excited and took me to my first gay club, saying how popular i'd be and generally making jokes.

We have always been friendly but since I came out he's taken me under his wing a lot, we go to the gym to work out, he hits the pool with me and helps me out with water polo (I play a lot) and has even pretended to be my boyfriend when a creep wouldn't leave me alone. I thought it was just a passing crush but I really can't stop thinking about him...

He flirts in a jokey way, he's seen me on grindr and told me that my picture is hot, but I know he would never want a relationship because he always talks about how he wants to be single and fuck around (he's a bit of a player, he looks after me and is pretty protective but is generally a bit of a douche with guys who are into him).

I have no idea how he views me, as some kind of little brother he's taken under his wing or as something else. We've kissed once, but as I said that was him warning off a creep in a club that wouldn't stop bugging me. He's said a couple of his gay friends think I'm hot but he tells them to stay away...its really confusing.

Sorry for rambling...I needed to vent because ive never actually put into words how I feel about this guy! Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.


EDIT: So after considering all the comments I actually decided to go for a drink with him and explore it all in a light hearted way.

Long story short we established he'd ""fuck the shit outta me"" but he said knowing how he is, he wouldn't wanna ruin what we have...

Kinda sucks but if guess that's just the curse of liking the bad boys. Thanks for all your comments bros!

We chatted about a lot of things but then the topic of spooning came up, I said that I quite enjoyed spooning and cuddling but he said he didn't see the point of it? He said he's a heavy sleeper but doesn't really want to sleep beside someone when they're really close and is adamant that body contact is not necessary when falling asleep. 

I FUCKING LOVE CUDDLING, it's helps me fall asleep when my big spoon slows down their breathing and gently holds me. I was put off when it was said but ignored it for the time being for the sake of the date. Other than that he was a really sweet, cute and confident guy that I wouldn't mind having a few more dates with.

I know people have their reasons but for me, body contact and intimacy go hand in hand and I really cannot see myself having a relationship with a guy who won't cuddle me at night or feels like they're obliged to do so :(

I mean 'this is exactly what I'm looking for in a potential husband' material.

Except I think he's confused. I know he's certainly gay when he's had a lot to drink, so logically, I think he's probably also gay when he's not drunk. Because alcohol doesn't cause temporary cases of faggotry, as far as I know.

Normally I would just say 'fuck it' and leave him alone, but I really like this guy. I stopped doing hook ups and started looking for someone special when I was 18, and I'm now 25 and this is the first guy I've met who I've been interested in. This confusion is the only thing I don't like.

Does anyone have experience or suggestions on how to deal with this?

---

I wrote you an essay, too. I met this guy at a party at a convention. He's traveling around the US. We had a lot to drink, and then decided we were hungry, so we stumbled around until we found something. We took it back to the convention, sat down, and talked while we ate. He already knew I was gay, so I asked if he was gay. He said 'A little, when I'm drunk.'

Next day, we spent the entire day hanging out and did a lot more drinking (I mean a lot of drinking. He can't even remember parts of that day). I suggested we hold hands to make a show for the groups of 15 year old girls at the convention, so we went around holding hands. Even when we left the convention to get food or go somewhere, he kept taking my hand back whenever I had to let him go to get my wallet or phone, so I thought he was interested in me.

We shared contact info and parted ways. He was going to another con somewhat nearby next week, so I decided to meet up with him there. We shared a hotel suite and bed together. We did a bit of drinking on the first night, though not much, and I asked if he wanted to hold hands after. He told me that he wasn't drunk enough (ouch).

We had a bit more to drink the next day, and then when it was time for bed, he left his shirt on, which was weird because he always sleeps with it off. During the night, he got really close to me, and rubbed my leg a bit. I went 'Hmm?' but he didn't respond, so I wasn't sure if he was just moving a lot in his sleep or wanted something and just kind of went back to sleep.

The next day, I asked him about the night, and he just brushed it off with 'I don't know,' and I responded with something like 'Okay, I don't want to accidentally rape you, but if you want to cuddle or anything, I'd enjoy it,' and he responded something like 'Yeah, trying not to rape people is a good trait.' We spent the rest of the day together, went to bed as usual (shirt off), and he didn't get close again.

The next day, we hung out until I had to leave for my flight, and that was it. We're still in contact online, but it's like he doesn't like talking with text. Sometimes he doesn't respond, or doesn't try keep the conversation going, which I kind of interpret as him not wanting to talk to me, but he was also like this on the morning we were holding hands, before we met up.

I felt like I was maybe messaging him too much or something, so I stopped trying to talk to him every day or two. One of my first boyfriends was in town one night and asked me to meet up for dinner. He brought his girlfriend, it was really awkward, I had a lot to drink, and spent most of the night thinking about this guy. When I got home, I wrote an essay confessing that I really like him and that he can let me know if I'm ever bothering him or messaging him too much or anything. He read it, but didn't respond, and we kept going with the occasional conversations.

Recently, he told me that he's coming to the city I live in and staying for a while. We had a conversation about stuff we like, and then I suggested that we get together and do something while he's here, or he could come visit me, and he's welcome to stay with me if he needs a place. He didn't respond, though we had another conversation the next day, and I'm not sure how to proceed from here. 

Everything he does confuses me; I can't tell if he's interested in me or not, or if he's confused about his sexuality, and it's leaving me at a loss. I don't think he's ever been in a relationship, either. It's like whenever I bring up anything to try to clarify how he feels about me (or even if he feels like I'm smothering him), he just steps around it.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I met I guy I really like.

I've never gone before and I hear it's somewhat intense: people in bondage, random naked people offing each other within feet of you, etc. I'm interested in going with a gay friend I know (and I myself am gay), but he's for sure going with a couple other gay guys I'm not as comfortable with, and I know one of them is a lot more outspoken and flamboyant.

Okay, My question am I gay? I think I might be, or is it a phase I am going through?

I am wondering if I am gay. I have had a lot of distress with this. Heres is why i suspect and my story up to thinking

I have always been a very pro-gay rights person, I decided at a young age, that I was not going to be like my parents and if my son or daughter figured out they were gay, trans, bi, or anything else, I would support them and not give a shit about what sexuality they are, as they cannot control it and love them all the same. I know being gay is not a choice, but me being around 13 and living with my parents(like a normal teen..), They do not think so, they believe that being gay is dirty ect and they think that gay people can be ""cured"" (which is utter bullshit if I may add.). I never gave it much thought, but I never really have been attracted to girls, at all. I never had a crush on a girl, and I realized that thats not normal. before you begin saying ""You are asexual."", I have a sex drive, a very large one at that. Well, My gay friend linked me some gay porn as prank, I watched it and became aroused... I thought ""omg I want to be with that guy"" and afterwards thought to myself ""Wait... what did i just think?"". I still have some misconceptions about being gay, due to my homophobic parents, I have been working on them though. My gay friend kissed me and I enjoyed it, I really felt aroused due to it, and wanted to go a bit of a few steps more (if you get what i'm saying..). Anyway, is this a sign of me being gay, I never gave it up thought, but does it seem like it? 

Also, I know that if I am, my parents would send me off to get ""cured"" someway or another, that is what is making me so distressed, they would also essentially shun me too. help a guy out?

In all that time, I've only been able to make him come a handful (heh) of times. He used to get himself off but in the last few months he seems to be having more difficulty.

I talked to him about it before. Last year he was gone away for a few weeks and the week before he came back I suggested we both not masturbate so that when we see each other we'll have great sex. And we did. It was amazing. I was able to make him cum three times in the space of a few hours.

Soon after that he got a tumblr account. Since then, it's been downhill. He doesn't know that it's possible to see other user's liked posts on tumblr so sometimes I have a look at his and it's all porn. Sometimes I see him liking loads of porn and then I try sexting him and he just doesn't acknowledge it. When we're having sex, it now feels like he's just doing me a favour because he rarely gets off.

At the moment he's away again and he's watching a serious amount of porn. I sent him a pic earlier and a long descriptive text about what I want to do to him once he gets back and he didn't acknowledge it at all.

He says he loves me and I believe him. When I brought up this with him a few months back he says he is attracted to me and doesn't know why he can't cum around me anymore. Personally I believe it's because of too much porn. After that time last year when he went a week without it and then we had that crazy day of sex, I'm confident that's what is behind his problem. And as well, it makes me feel really insecure and unattractive. Knowing he's looking at porn while I'm sending him texts/pics/gifs of me and he's not acknowledging them.

So do you have any advice about what I could say to him when he gets back from his trip in a few weeks? At the moment breaking up isn't an option because I do love him with all my heart, but I feel like it is reaching breaking point.

Sorry if this is badly written. I'm in kind of a tizzy over the whole thing because I have nobody to talk to about it. I don't want to say this to him while he's on vacation and tainting his trip.

Thanks in advance.

EDIT: I forgot to mention, when we started going out that I suffered from this problem. I would get super hard having sex around him but I couldn't cum. So I stopped jackin' it for a while and didn't watch porn after a while it got better for me.

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: I forgot to mention, when we started going out that I suffered from this problem. I would get super hard having sex around him but I couldn&amp;#39;t cum. So I stopped jackin&amp;#39; it for a while and didn&amp;#39;t watch porn after a while it got better for me. So I feel like I could help him by telling him I went through the same thing, just not for as long a period.&lt;/p&gt;

I don't have a lot of butt hair but it's black so it stands out. I think that removing it will make it look esthetically better but the real reason is more functional:

As you could see from my loooong posts history that I've been dealing with a small amount of pimples on my butt (which looks bad and hurts :/). I remembered that if you have laser hair removal it can reduce/eliminate the creation of new pimples. So I really have to benefit from it. 

I'm also planning to reduce the amount on my thighs so it will look natural (I don't like the density of the hair down there) 

My real questions are 1) did you have experience with such thing? I'm worried that it might be uncomfortable (because hair is a buffer down there) 2) should I consider only removing from the cheeks and keep in the middle (for said buffering) 3) do you guys think this will look weird? Thanks in advance!
