The first time we actually went out, there was just so much chemistry between us. He would reach out and touch my hand, and it felt like electricity was running up my arm. After dinner, we went to a gay bar for drinks and wound up making out for a bit.

Things have been weird since then, though. He recently went through two terrible experiences, and says that he's not emotionally available for a relationship. 

The thing is, though, is that he always gives me signals that he's very much into me. He recently came over to my place, and we had such a wonderful time together. We made food, played video games, and just genuinely enjoyed each other's company. Toward the end of the night, when I brought out wine, we started getting a little flirty. He held my hand a little, but we didn't kiss. He said he doesn't want to confuse me. As I walked him out, we hugged, but the hug lasted for a while and we simply held each other by the door. He tells me that he really likes me and cares for me, but can't give me what I want.

I really, really like this guy. I don't think I've connected with someone so well before. I know--beyond the shadow of a doubt--that we would be fantastic together and that, given the chance, we could be together for a very long time. 

I also don't want to force him to do something he's not ready to do. I want to honor his own process and respect his wishes.

What should I do? Should I wait around for him to be ready, or do I simply stay his friend and keep dating other guys? Also, how can I be there for him while at the same time protecting myself from falling for someone who may not fall for me?

I have yet to go through the degree of heartbreak he's faced, so if anyone out there with a similar experience can explain how he might be feeling, I'd greatly appreciate it.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I met this guy about a month ago, and we&amp;#39;ve really hit it off.&lt;/p&gt;

This part of my post serves as a thank you to this fantastic community! You guys are some of the coolest strangers on the internet, always willing to help out or be there for people who are down on their luck. Offering some of the best advice to those people and helping them overcome some of their worst times. People from this community have helped me when I have been unsure on issues or when I was going through a very severe depression, pretty much considering ending my life at certain points. But the nice comments, love and support from this community has really kept me going strong, just to know that some complete strangers will take time out of their day to help cheer people up or give them guidance when they need it the most is one of the nicest and often times very underappreciated things this community does for people. Putting up with all the ""I am in love with my straight friend"" posts, helping people and giving them guidance when it comes to being safe, relationship advice and then just letting people know that a complete stranger cares about them and will be there for them. So once again, thank you to the community of r/askgaybros I hope you all have a fantastic new year!

I even stole my mom's credit card to buy a porn membership(I know, really crazy). I watched straight porn every night for three years. One time, my male friend came over and we started touching each other's dicks and humping each other(it was strange) he kept stroking my dick but that's about as far as we went. I have thought nothing of it since. Keep in mind this all happened before I had any sort of intimacy with a girl. This past year, I've gotten into gay porn.

When I see other guys I might say &amp;quot;hey he&amp;#39;s a good looking dude&amp;quot; but I don&amp;#39;t want to have any sort of sexual encounter with him. I haven&amp;#39;t even kissed a girl, but when girls touch me, flirt, etc, I get a boner. My question to you is, is this normal? Am I gay, bi, or straight? It almost seems like porn has turned me gay because I have always liked girls but recently I haven&amp;#39;t been to do things  such as get a boner looking at hot pictures of girls. Any advice is seriously helpful because this has been killing me lately.&lt;/p&gt;

Happy New Year's Eve Eve.  As I write this, I'm sitting on my couch feeling like absolute crap because I think I've lost a best friend AND caused a break-up.

I'm on vacation from work this week.  Late Sunday night, a friend and I decided to go out for a few drinks to celebrate our mutual not-having-to-work on Monday.  He is dating my best friend.  We went out.  He drank four glasses of wine and for whatever reason, got really drunk off it.  Back at my apartment, I gave him some pizza, lots of water, and advil.  There was no way he was driving home.. in fact, he passed out in my kitchen.  I got him to bed and he knocked out.  I went to sleep.  Nothing inappropriate happened.

The next morning, we had lunch, dropped some food off for his working boyfriend, and went on our separate ways.

Last night I get a call from my friend.  He's F*CKING FURIOUS.. says I disrespected our friendship by ""sneaking around"" with his boyfriend and getting him drunk.  He says I ruined our friendship and that he and his boyfriend were done.  I tried telling him that I thought he knew we were out.  I really did!  But before I could explain any further, he hung up on me.  I sent him a long text explaining myself and he wrote back (hours later) to say that they're just words and that if I truly valued his friendship, things would've transpired differently.  Now, things are very cold between us.

His boyfriend seems quite nonchalant about it.  Says he didn't tell his boyfriend we were going out because it was late and he was already sleeping.  He says that they've had a similar blow-up before and that it'll pass.  I don't know.

I feel awful.  Truly awful about it.  For the first time in recent memory, I just don't know what to do.  I don't have a solution.  I refuse to lose my best friend over something so innocent.  I practically cried myself to sleep last night.  I'm so lost and confused about what happened.

Looking at my past and even current history, I worry I may be bisexual. I've always written off as just crazy hormones or me just being a really horny person (which I am) who will take any warm wet hole, but this has lasted and persisted for 10+ years now, and I worry it might mean something more serious.

For example, In 2nd or 3rd grade I had a best friend who would meet with me in the bathroom after school. We would compare and touch each other's penises. I distinctly remember him asking if we should kiss and me saying no cause that would be gay.

Then when I first started watching porn, I stumbled upon gay porn and took a liking to it, and since then have occasionally watched it, even up until today,

Then in middle school I had a best friend with whom I would pretty regularly jerk off together with.

Now in college, whenever I strike out with women I hit up Grindr for some NSA sex if Im feeling super horny.

I have never been romantically attracted to a man, but at the same time you could say I have never given myself the chance. And if I am indeed bisexual, I do not even know where I would start. Coming out to my parents and friends would be almost impossible, they have always seen me with girls and girlfriends and hear of my sexual escapes.

I still am not sure whether I truly am bisexual or if I am just a horny fuck. Not sure what I am trying to get by posting this, but maybe it will help.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may get long winded, but please bear with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at my past and even current history, I worry I may be bisexual. I&amp;#39;ve always written off as just crazy hormones or me just being a really horny person (which I am) who will take any warm wet hole, but this has lasted and persisted for 10+ years now, and I worry it might mean something more serious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, In 2nd or 3rd grade I had a best friend who would meet with me in the bathroom after school. We would compare and touch each other&amp;#39;s penises. I distinctly remember him asking if we should kiss and me saying no cause that would be gay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then when I first started watching porn, I stumbled upon gay porn and took a liking to it, and since then have occasionally watched it, even up until today,&lt;/p&gt;

My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 11 months now, and just earlier this month I finally grew to the balls and confessed how I felt towards him. I wasn't expecting him to say ""I love you"" back, and was completely fine with the response I got, which was ""I've never had anyone tell me that before. I don't know what to say"", to which I replied ""I'm not expecting you to say anything, I just wanted to let you know."" Well after that we both went home for the holidays, and he's been really short over text. Over the break he came out to his family, and his mom told him that he sounds unsure about himself, which he stated is true. I told him that if he needs to talk that I'm there for him.

Now I don't know if he's being distant because he's still processing his feelings after coming out, or if i scared him off by saying that I love him, or a combo of the both. I might just be overthinking this but any advice or stories of similar experiences would help.

Also I'm somewhat new here, so if this is in the wrong subreddit I apologize, just let me know and I can fix it.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So i&amp;#39;ll try to keep this short. &lt;/p&gt;
