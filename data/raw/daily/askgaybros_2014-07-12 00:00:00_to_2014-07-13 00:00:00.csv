And if you have any other cool tips on what to see/do around the area that would be greatly appreciated as well :) I noticed London is immensely touristy,and we're curious to see what the real Londoners do in their free time!!

I need serious emotional guidance and, while gay guys on the internet can be a nasty bunch, they and you reading are likely still the closest thing to me in terms of emotional awareness and my comrade in spirit.  If you want to read about my feelings tonight and offer insight I would be appreciative, just please refrain from giving me ""practical"" advice.  I wont be seeing any therapists or changing my diet or trying something new in bed.  Rather, if anything strikes a chord, Id like to hear about that, or what kind of perspective would make my situation more pleasant and bearable.  How can I look at this better and just survive?

Today I got home from work, exhausted, over-exerted.  I was otherwise excited to play some video games.  I got a call from a friend who said she and some others were going to a baseball game and I declined an offer to go with her.  I dont like baseball, the seats are uncomfortable, and the beer is piss water.  I didnt go grocery shopping because I didnt feel like it.  I didnt do the laundry because I knew it could wait a few more days.  I didnt do the dishes because I can just get takeout.

I turned on my xbox and then I just let it run and stared at my avatar.  It has been the same for eight years, since a friend of mine made it in high school.  Its me, done pretty accurately considering my proportions, face, jaw, hair, eyes, height, build, it was almost like this friend had sized me up.  Im wearing a pinstripe suit and have a diamond stud earring in it.  I lost that friend a few years ago to distance, separation; I just didnt get to see him anymore.  I never found out if he had a tiny interested in bisexuality or not; he was very close with another friend of mine who is bisexual.  Then I made better friend with this mutual friend and he just disappeared out of my life after some griping about how he and I were supposed to be better friends than me and this mutual friend.

I watched computer-me dance around and wave and smile and I just zoned out, fell asleep flat on my face in my bed.  I slept for about an hour and dreamed of him, but I dont remember the content.  When I awoke I felt a profound sense of emptiness.  I couldnt summon the mental readiness needed to plan and play my current favorite game.  I then got up and pattered around on the computer, but I couldnt stand listening to my music or any of my favorite songs.   So I blanked out and decided I would buy some drugs instead. 

So I get pretty loaded on downers and instead of feeling that tingling dullness, I just felt normal, bored, plain.  I paged through a conversation with my college ex boyfriend, he's asking me for money in between pages and pages of endearingly confessional pleas for love and affection.  I check my phone, there are three guys texting me confessing their love for me, just like they do every day.  I complain alot about being lonely but for being a miserable loner I sure do have a way of getting all the guys I date to fall head over heels in love with me to the point of exacerbating some life crisis for them.  One has turned bitter, another has moved from the state, a third is hopelessly doll-eyed in his pursuit of me.  I did enjoy my time with them, but they all treated me poorly, took advantage of my inexperience with guys, and held back from returning the affections I lavished them with.  In the end, I concluded that none of them understood the weight of the word ""love"" as I believe I understand it, and they are operating on ego and lust.  

I call my boss and tell him I will come in extra days next week like he had asked earlier.  He is overjoyed.  Of all my jobs, all my bosses glow with delight at the sight of me, somehow I exceed the call of duty and take an initiative above and beyond the satisfactory standards of workmanship.  I take pride in my work as a craft, as I do with anything I lay my hands upon, but it really comes naturally.  I know my showing up extra days will make his life much easier, and I am glad to be given such responsibility at age 23.  But I still feel unfulfilled.  

I stare at my half-finished art projects; I just dont have the heart to keep working on them.  The parts I would start into would be bleak and grey and formless and devoid of passion.  I would ruin anything creative I would try to do in this mindset.  I listen to a voicemail from my dad, he's yammering on about some tired rhetoric that circles around his idealism that I need to be some johnny-do-good golden-boy.  He slips in a few challenges of my faith.  Time and time again of me pleading and begging for him to just give my feelings the slightest respect, and offer me the most meager consideration for where I stand as a man coming into his own in the world, he does tend to completely ignore it and instead claim that all my frustrations would vanish should I 'give myself to christ'.  I just cant believe it, the nonsense and fairy-tales and millennia of lies that this species has spread amongst itself.   Just like our fear of gayness as a society, I am similarly incensed by the concept of religion - the most worthless enterprise of humanity that dominates headlines and intellectual thought and corrupts our cultures and tends our civilizations to disorder.  The faithful are the most pathetic creatures.

My mother pulled this same crap in a way today.  She always tries to corner me with conversation.  She always tried to accuse me of not telling her anything about my life.  She tried to guilt me into playing the role of her romanticized concept.  She is in love with the idea of me but hasnt the faintest idea of who I actually am or what I tangibly require to be a human being.  She uses double talk and tries to coax out through shame the answers she wants to hear from me.  I just have to shut her out of my mind and ears.  I just dont love her anymore like I used to.  Shes nothing but a shrewish pain in my side, an emotional tumor clinging to my frontal lobe.  Sometimes I wish she would just say she is disappointed in me and then move on.

She made some comment about my college ex that I am still thinking about - that I should have just been out all along 'because I could have been the whole time!'.  Her words, not my reality.  Funny how she always tries to gaslight me into thinking I had such an open and accepting family.  But when I bring up the way things actually happened she frustratingly looks at me with the most sincerity she can muster in her feigned confusion.  I guess pray-the-gay-away camps, harassment of blacks and gays, abhorrent racism, prideful narcissistic arrogance, and holier-than-thou antisocial cruelty are the hallmarks of any 'good american family'.  I mean, surely she remembers the time she threw me in the mental hospital for being gay and socially maladaptive and emotionally disfigured?  Oh, thats right, it was because I was a drug addict since I had told her I smoked weed and took pills recreationally with my friends.  Thats something she loves to bring up too, how my struggle with drug addiction is going.  Sometimes I take drugs just because I get so mad that she tries to paint me as a drug addict to everyone in my life.  My words and my life is not enough, she wants to write the script, and she uses the arm of my hot-headed father to do it.

But I am my own man now, I pay my rent, I drive my own car.  I dont need them, though occasionally I longingly imagine what it would be like to have had a different family, that would have just loved me for the person I was instead of hating me for refusing to become the person they wanted me to be.  I never wanted the life they laid out for me, I never wanted the lessons in which they expended years where instead I could have been a part of the formative joys my other friends were discovering.  Relationships, college, fleshing out their talents.  Im just not me to them.  

Now Im just alone, staring at the game I dont have the energy to play.  Im trapped thinking on my regrets.  The drugs are a welcome reprieve but I know Ill be back in the slumps tomorrow looking for a way to distract myself from the harping of my negative thoughts.  I fear I will continue going to work, coming back tired, having less and less courage to do things each day.  I will become complacent and uninteresting.  I will perform my duties well, pay my bills on time, and live out my days with just myself until I just selfishly realize Im taking up space in the world.  Apparently it works better anyways if everyone is a money whore, or a religious zealot, or a manipulative con.  When I watch the news, or read stories online about people like Sarah Palin, I shudder at the percentage of the populous that is so ignorant and backwards and such a waste of life that they think someone like Sarah Palin has a valuable opinion on anything.  ""Impeach Obama"" stickers to me are basically tramp stamps to warn everyone around them that they are animals of reaction and willfully ignorant to even the simplest observational truths.  Why do we waste time debating climate change?  We ought to respect the planet we live on.  Sometimes I go on reddit and see people coming up with arguments against gay marriage, like they believe if they think hard enough on it they will convince others of some rationale based on how creeped out they are by it.  

Ive never once been fulfilled being gay, it has been an aching misery on my entire life.  I feel strange at gay bars, I try to have a good time and dance and sing and engage in thrilling flirts but at the end of the night I always have to retreat because deep down I know I hate myself for being different and being there and being a part of this world.  I cant bring myself to see the joy in it when through observation it brings me only hurt, has sabotaged my relationship with my family, and isolates me from my friends.  I cant talk to my brother because I know deep down my brother thinks people have the right to discriminate against gay people.  I love him, I love him so much he is so funny and was so cool and I always looked up to him but I cant even friend him on facebook or call him and tell him I love him because inside I know he wishes I was different.  My sister feels similarly insidiously prejudiced against it, not as strongly but for example she wanted romney to win because he was contrary to the wave of gay acceptance and believes there is room in politics for a debate on who I am.  Its like who I am should be a supreme court case.  I think its pathetic, a waste of time that we have to convince ourselves as a species that a certain minority of us exists and deserves human rights.  I think its pathetic that people try and hold onto the magic and mysticism of religion.  I think its pathetic that people put themselves before the goal of endgame cooperation between each other to secure our future and ensure our survival and create the best, most efficient, and most loving environment for our children so that they never have to experience the pain I experienced hating myself every day as I was coming into this world.

I even feel out of place in the world of being gay because of a strong fetish I have had almost as long as I have been gay for bigger guys.  As if I thought a big guy would come and be my friend and save me and hold me and tell me that what I was feeling was okay as a kid growing up.  Well that day never came and I still have to deal with that powerful oddball obsession.  I roll my eyes at the labels and terms and positions and dominance schemes and meat market attitude of being gay.  I used to thing it was a magical special gift at first, privately to myself before my parents got a hold of me to quash my sexuality.  I dont know what happened to that me that rode the tingling joy of feeling special and beautiful and excited to discover the passions within me.  Now id do almost anything or pay almost any price to subdue them, one day at a time, one pill at a time.

I dont know if I will ever be better, theres just no talking me out of a lifetime of bad feelings, but maybe I can just give my ex some money and at least have someone, who came close to being the most sincere anyone had ever been with me, to tell me they love me and that I matter and that its ok to be who I am.  Even if I dont believe it, it might be nice to hear.  I dont know if I will ever feel inspired to create or write again, I practice to keep my craftsmanship up but I might just give up on that in another couple of years too and just work and pile up money and leave it in a big pile for someone I love very much and make my departure from this life.  I just hate feeling like a defective part, and Im certain the world will keep turning in my absence, but I have a cat I love so dearly and he has developed the most fascinating personality that rivals modern theories on animal intelligence and socialization.  Hes rare and beautiful and would be heartbroken without me, when on the couple occasions people have cat-sitted for me they tell me I should come home early because they think he's going to die of a broken heart.  He cries and lays on the carpet and goes limp but I never see that.  He is brave and always happy and excited to greet me at the door, engage in a little conversation, and then get picked up and go have some lovins on the couch.  I may not have a brother, a father, a mother, and barely a sister because I am gay and not equipped to deal with life on their terms to sacrifice my wants to accept their demands, but I have a god damned cat that keeps me going and makes me feel like life is worth it just one more day at a time.  

If anything, this is a loveletter to my cat, my only real love.  I love you, orange fatboy, youre my pride and joy and sunshine on my cloudy days.  And to anyone thats ever felt like me, Im sorry and I wish I was there to hold your hand.  Were all just people and the posturing that goes on for the sake of bullshit modesty or dominance is just sad, Id be there just the same as the person I always wanted to save my life that never existed, I have a lot of love to give, but at last I feel that too is emptying.  Im so scared of each day, that I might wake up colder and colder until I just dont care anymore.  Anyways, I apologize for being terribly depressing, but I just cant take my life anymore the way it is, and short of running into the forest and seeing how long I can make it, I feel like getting these feelings out is the last ditch effort and reclaiming some of my lost and evaporating humanity.  ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isnt a happy or inspirational post, and Im not asking you anything, and if youre here to say something nasty to me just make your vulgar remark and downvote because I dont care about opinions on my writing style.

I mean, surely she remembers the time she threw me in the mental hospital for being gay and socially maladaptive and emotionally disfigured?  Oh, thats right, it was because I was a drug addict since I had told her I smoked weed and took pills recreationally with my friends.  Thats something she loves to bring up too, how my struggle with drug addiction is going.  Sometimes I take drugs just because I get so mad that she tries to paint me as a drug addict to everyone in my life.  My words and my life is not enough, she wants to write the script, and she uses the arm of my hot-headed father to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I am my own man now, I pay my rent, I drive my own car.  I dont need them, though occasionally I longingly imagine what it would be like to have had a different family, that would have just loved me for the person I was instead of hating me for refusing to become the person they wanted me to be.  I never wanted the life they laid out for me, I never wanted the lessons in which they expended years where instead I could have been a part of the formative joys my other friends were discovering.  Relationships, college, fleshing out their talents.  Im just not me to them.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now Im just alone, staring at the game I dont have the energy to play.  Im trapped thinking on my regrets.  The drugs are a welcome reprieve but I know Ill be back in the slumps tomorrow looking for a way to distract myself from the harping of my negative thoughts.  I fear I will continue going to work, coming back tired, having less and less courage to do things each day.  I will become complacent and uninteresting.  I will perform my duties well, pay my bills on time, and live out my days with just myself until I just selfishly realize Im taking up space in the world.  Apparently it works better anyways if everyone is a money whore, or a religious zealot, or a manipulative con.  When I watch the news, or read stories online about people like Sarah Palin, I shudder at the percentage of the populous that is so ignorant and backwards and such a waste of life that they think someone like Sarah Palin has a valuable opinion on anything.  &amp;quot;Impeach Obama&amp;quot; stickers to me are basically tramp stamps to warn everyone around them that they are animals of reaction and willfully ignorant to even the simplest observational truths.  Why do we waste time debating climate change?  We ought to respect the planet we live on.  Sometimes I go on reddit and see people coming up with arguments against gay marriage, like they believe if they think hard enough on it they will convince others of some rationale based on how creeped out they are by it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ive never once been fulfilled being gay, it has been an aching misery on my entire life.  I feel strange at gay bars, I try to have a good time and dance and sing and engage in thrilling flirts but at the end of the night I always have to retreat because deep down I know I hate myself for being different and being there and being a part of this world.  I cant bring myself to see the joy in it when through observation it brings me only hurt, has sabotaged my relationship with my family, and isolates me from my friends.  I cant talk to my brother because I know deep down my brother thinks people have the right to discriminate against gay people.  I love him, I love him so much he is so funny and was so cool and I always looked up to him but I cant even friend him on facebook or call him and tell him I love him because inside I know he wishes I was different.  My sister feels similarly insidiously prejudiced against it, not as strongly but for example she wanted romney to win because he was contrary to the wave of gay acceptance and believes there is room in politics for a debate on who I am.  Its like who I am should be a supreme court case.  I think its pathetic, a waste of time that we have to convince ourselves as a species that a certain minority of us exists and deserves human rights.  I think its pathetic that people try and hold onto the magic and mysticism of religion.  I think its pathetic that people put themselves before the goal of endgame cooperation between each other to secure our future and ensure our survival and create the best, most efficient, and most loving environment for our children so that they never have to experience the pain I experienced hating myself every day as I was coming into this world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I even feel out of place in the world of being gay because of a strong fetish I have had almost as long as I have been gay for bigger guys.  As if I thought a big guy would come and be my friend and save me and hold me and tell me that what I was feeling was okay as a kid growing up.  Well that day never came and I still have to deal with that powerful oddball obsession.  I roll my eyes at the labels and terms and positions and dominance schemes and meat market attitude of being gay.  I used to thing it was a magical special gift at first, privately to myself before my parents got a hold of me to quash my sexuality.  I dont know what happened to that me that rode the tingling joy of feeling special and beautiful and excited to discover the passions within me.  Now id do almost anything or pay almost any price to subdue them, one day at a time, one pill at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dont know if I will ever be better, theres just no talking me out of a lifetime of bad feelings, but maybe I can just give my ex some money and at least have someone, who came close to being the most sincere anyone had ever been with me, to tell me they love me and that I matter and that its ok to be who I am.  Even if I dont believe it, it might be nice to hear.  I dont know if I will ever feel inspired to create or write again, I practice to keep my craftsmanship up but I might just give up on that in another couple of years too and just work and pile up money and leave it in a big pile for someone I love very much and make my departure from this life.  I just hate feeling like a defective part, and Im certain the world will keep turning in my absence, but I have a cat I love so dearly and he has developed the most fascinating personality that rivals modern theories on animal intelligence and socialization.  Hes rare and beautiful and would be heartbroken without me, when on the couple occasions people have cat-sitted for me they tell me I should come home early because they think he&amp;#39;s going to die of a broken heart.  He cries and lays on the carpet and goes limp but I never see that.  He is brave and always happy and excited to greet me at the door, engage in a little conversation, and then get picked up and go have some lovins on the couch.  I may not have a brother, a father, a mother, and barely a sister because I am gay and not equipped to deal with life on their terms to sacrifice my wants to accept their demands, but I have a god damned cat that keeps me going and makes me feel like life is worth it just one more day at a time.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anything, this is a loveletter to my cat, my only real love.  I love you, orange fatboy, youre my pride and joy and sunshine on my cloudy days.  And to anyone thats ever felt like me, Im sorry and I wish I was there to hold your hand.  Were all just people and the posturing that goes on for the sake of bullshit modesty or dominance is just sad, Id be there just the same as the person I always wanted to save my life that never existed, I have a lot of love to give, but at last I feel that too is emptying.  Im so scared of each day, that I might wake up colder and colder until I just dont care anymore.  Anyways, I apologize for being terribly depressing, but I just cant take my life anymore the way it is, and short of running into the forest and seeing how long I can make it, I feel like getting these feelings out is the last ditch effort and reclaiming some of my lost and evaporating humanity.  &lt;/p&gt;

He just graduated from the university we both went to and I'm a rising sophomore. I'm living at home right now about 3 hours away from where we go to school where he lives. This was my first relationship and while I remained cautious, I was still kind of ignorant to a lot of the complications our relationship posed. I met his parents and we had a wonderful 2 months together, but on the way home from Bonnaroo, we started to talk and he said that he thought we should take a break until the end of the summer due to issues with stress he was having and that one of the main contributors to the stress was him not knowing where he'd be in a year seeing as he will start applying to law schools in the Fall and wants to go out of state. I also left out the fact that I met him right after he had come out of a year and a half relationship. He always made sure I knew that he wasn't just using me and that being with me made him forget about his previous relationships, but he still couldn't handle the thought of having to end a relationship with me due to Law school based on personal experiences with breakups, especially the previous one. He used the word ""break"" but it all sounded really final and if I don't do anything when I move back, I think it's over. 

At first I was hurt, but it's been a month and I've thought about it a lot from his position and it makes sense. We still talk every single day, but I can't help but feel like our relationship won't surpass this friendship we've begun once I move back to school. Part of me wants to make the mature decision in order to protect myself and my feelings in the future. But I also think life is too short, and we both clearly like each other a lot so it only makes sense to me that we should take advantage of the year we still have together if he does move which he wants to do so badly(which I don't want to hold him back from doing). 

I'll be fine if we stay friends, he's the type of guy I'd want to be lifelong friends with, not for romantic or sexual reasons, just his personality and interests and based on my emotions right now, I doubt I'd have a rough time moving on and meeting someone else. But I also can't help but think our ""end"" was premature. When he dropped me off after our talk, we hugged and kissed for a really long time and I could see the pain in his eyes as he said bye. And I can't get them out of my head.

Also I miss the sex. A lot. He's really fucking hot and jesus I've been sexually frustrated since the last time I saw him. 

So yeah any advice please. I think I have a good idea of what I want to do and say when we see each other again, but I'd love to hear other people's experiences and opinions.
