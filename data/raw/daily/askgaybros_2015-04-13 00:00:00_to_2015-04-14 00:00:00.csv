So I (17) kind of had a date with someone  (23) recently. We were originally meant to just hang out, but we ended up chatting, exploring a park for five hours, my hand around him to keep him warm, and him snuggling into me. 

I had an amazing time and he says he had fun too. I'm just worried about being too pushy or uninteresting after the date (if it even was one). 

How can I still keep it casual?

He said that he's had 12 girl friends and the longest relationship he's had has been 3 months and he's still a virgin. He's had 7 other guys to ask him out but he had told them he was straight each time.

I just want to see him happy. I told him how I use to be homophobic and before the end of high school I would have to everyone that I was straight, but it all changed over 3 years. I just don't want him to find out later he could be gay and feel alone and like he wasted part of his life.

I told him I was crushing hard on him, and how I could really help him out in his life. He still said that he was straight, I told him that I would respect that and leave him alone about it, but I was hoping we could at least still be roommates.

I'm an african american male, I'm quite attractive (so I've been told), I'm really atheletic, and I conform to western society's construct of a ""masculine"" male (for better or worse most people assume I'm straight). 

Unfortunately, attending university in the south, most guys are only into hookup culture/identify as being ""straight"". 
In addition to this, I get lots of compliments but then many guys proceed to tell me they're not into african american guys (from guys of all ethnicities).

Will things be better in New York (as far as my ethnicity not affecting my relational life and actually finding people to date vs hookups) or am I getting my hopes up?

Thanks,

It's been therapeutic but everything isn't all that necessary to read, so I've put those bits in italics if you'd like to just skip over (if you do choose to read this)**

*I've been catching posts here and there on this board every now and then for a while, and maybe it's because I have a boyfriend now and we're going through a rough patch but I've been seeing more and more about relationships that are on the rocks. So I'm laying here at 4am thinking 'let's throw it out there'. Maybe it will be therapeutic to write it down.*


So I started dating this boy in late January. We made it official a month in but neither of us has seen anyone else since after our 2nd date. *(honestly I didn't even know I HAD to make it official... I called him my boyfriend once before that and he responded with ""oh really??"" inquisitively and with a smirk.)*

We've had some good times together, some really fun times, I met his friends pretty quickly and he's been meeting mine through the weeks. I was genuinely enjoying being around him and getting to know him. And also opening up to him about me. We just goofed off most nights and had a good time. 

Last weekend we got home from a party at  my cousins house. It wasn't really his scene (frat boys and stoners), and honestly it wasn't fully mine. *I haven't been to a party there for a while, but I know that some of their parties have a strange turnout.* I was still having an alright time seeing people I hadn't for a while but him and my lady friend that tagged along were clearly not. So after a little effort to get some socialization going I said screw it and we headed out and got some late night café food. We were joking around and having fun and I liked that him and my girl were getting along well. *Earlier that night we had a little issue, he came over at about 9 and we watched the end of the NCAA game with my Dad and his girlfriend, I was having a hoot with them just joking around but he was quiet. I was getting stir crazy and definitely ready to go but when the game ended he went up to my room and laid down. I went up a few minutes later and he was being kind of whiny, said his canker sores hurt and he was hungry. I did my loving thing and asked what he wanted and if I could get anything for his mouth. After pulling some teeth he landed on a burrito and I had the stuff so I said we could make him one so he didn't have to spend money on one. And then he just acted like 'ok now to make it'. I'm fine cooking food for him but I at least wanted him to join me in the kitchen. He didn't want to he just wanted to watch another game that was on. Whatever I thought, I'll just suck it up and do it and try and move on so we can get out of here and have a good night. We finally left and i guess he could tell I was still a little urked so he asked and I told him. He apologized but still seemed weird so I asked him the same, ""is something wrong?"" he wouldn't talk. He's quiet and getting him to tell me anything he think might upset me is like pulling teeth...from someone who has their mouth wired shut...who is also a mime...who only shrugs. So we moved on and then the party and then the 2 am food.*

We got back to my place and laid down, we had been laying there for maybe 20 minutes when he just got up, said he was going home and left. I said 'uhhh, you sure you don't want to talk?' and he said no and I walked him out to shut the door. No hug no kiss no bye, just left. I was fucking confused. I was laying in bed, sure I wouldn't get sleep anytime soon, and he texted me. 

'do you think we're right for each other? '

' do you see us working long term? '

' we have nothing in common'

'I'm not happy... '


I think I answered all these questions pretty maturely. 

' I don't know if we're meant to be together forever, but I do love you and I live spending time with you '

' we've only known each other 2 months so it's hard to say'

Etc.. (I'm paraphrasing a bit) 

I asked him how he felt about us and he said ""I honestly don't think we'll work out"". To which my heart sank a bit. It felt like he broke up with me. A few minutes later he wrote ""I've never felt this way about anyone before though "". Okay. Confusion. What's up then.... 

He asked if he could come back and I would come out and talk to him, so we went on a drive and talked for a bit. He says we don't have a lot in common. He likes to play and watch sports, I don't really care about pro sports but I find it entertaining enough. I'll never be the guy that's rooting along with him but I like the athletics of it. *I'm just not competitive so I couldn't care less who wins.* I do love watching people I know play though, so I will be on the sidelines cheering him on whenever I can. I said I would never play on a league though. I reiterate that I am not competitive. Okay. Maybe he can be alright with that. 

But he moves on to religion. He is LDS. I wasn't raised religious but found Buddhism which led me to Taoism which is what rings pretty true to me. Live in the now. He mentions the afterlife. If I don't believe in God then I won't be spending eternity with him. I know that this is a huge part of the LDS teachings, so I can understand his struggle. That's a main purpose in life for them, to make it to the Celestial Kingdom. I don't have any solid beliefs on what happens after we die, which is hard for him to comprehend. So I don't really have anything here to ease his woes, so to say. I do find out though, in how he talked, that he finds my beliefs a little silly. *We're all a part of nature. We're as connected to each other as we are to the trees and to the animals and every living thing. We're all energy. We're all stardust. I also had mentioned my spirit animal being the cat as we were driving home from the party earlier, which is I think what kind of pushed this talk into happening. He said my cat had jumped up on the bed and laid on his legs which is what made him get pissed and get up and leave. I didn't even know she had gotten up there but I do try and keep her away from his face  because he's allergic.*

This leads us to the next point, he thinks love for my cat is weird and the i might never be able to love him as much as I do my cat. *I had April Fools'd him a few days earlier by telling him my cat was pregnant. He was very distraught when I said of course I'd be keeping the kittens, but a week earlier I had already told him that if we moved in together, once my cat passed I would not get another cat. I would be perfectly okay getting a different animal. I love animals but I wouldn't want him to be more miserable. Anyways* he tells me this and all I can say is I do love him, and I love my cat, but they're TOTALLY different types of love. I say maybe it's strange, she has a Facebook (that I almost never post on) and I take a lot of pictures of her, but it's because when I'm with her I'm somewhat bored and laying around the house. I didn't have a lot to respond but I also was confused because he has a dog that he loves too. And I'm surrounded by people that love their animals. I worked at a shelter for a while even. 

Anyways... We finish this talk. I tell him I'd love to do more stuff with him. I'd love to get out together. Just let me know what you have in mind and I'll do the same. He seemed to be in  a better mood and we drove back to my house joking. He stayed the night and we were good.....but then I woke up in a bad mood. He left for work and I just thought to myself, he almost broke up with me. He almost broke up with me with no notice. He almost did it over text without me even knowing there was a problem! 
I did some family stuff he got off work and did his family stuff and I just laid in bed all day depressed (I was also crazy tired from being up until 530 am but a nap would not come.) 

*God. Im rambling a lot, I'm sorry, but I've got to get it all out. Thank you to anyone that cares to read all of this.*

We see each other that night and it's a little weird. He sleeps over but we decide to sleep apart most of the week. But I tell him we still need to talk. I couldn't find the words that night but I tell him I'm not feeling great about the fact that he went from crying and feeling like we should break up to smiling and joking.

So we've talked a few nights since then. Spent some time together between our unusually busy schedules, we've worked some things out. Worked through some insecurities that might have led him to his breakdown that night, like being left without notice, being cheated on,  etc.. I found out some of it was that he just got to a weird point that made him question things. I let him know the way he went about it fucked with me a lot. I've had friends up and leave me, some for some shitty part in my life that I guess overshadowed how they felt about me as a person. Some for being gay. But never was there really an explanation. If there is I can handle it. If there's rationale I'm coo, whatever it's sad, it's gone, but I can manage. If someone leaves my bed at 3 am without saying anything and then texts me they're not happy with us then no I'll be spending the next few weeks or months  trying to figure out **what the fuck happened.**

But even after all this talk, I'm still feeling weird. The last two days we've spent a good amount of time together and it's been nice. I am enjoying it, but then when we're not together I'm feeling so weird about things. I get sad. I want to smoke like crazy. I want to smoke weed again which I haven't in a year or so and haven't wanted to in moooonths. He mentioned that he doesn't like my smoking (cigarettes) when we were talking that first night. I smoke maybe 3 a day on average but I said I would cut back. I even had already been thinking it would be a good idea because my allergies and a creeping sickness have made breathing hard lately. But now I've been hitting my e-cig like crazy and even having a cigarette here and there just to calm my nerves. I generally smoke because I enjoy it and it's relaxing. Not because I'm anxious!
I just feel... off. 

Even when he said, over text, that he didn't know if we were going to work, my thought was 'Okay, I guess that's that.' it was kind of an acceptance. Kind of a 'maybe he's right' and a lot of 'fuck him then if he's going to do it this way and he really doesn't want to be with me.'

I just don't know where to go from here. I'm confused. I'm new to this.

I need a fucking outlet. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I just realized I&amp;#39;ve rambled a lot.

Worked through some insecurities that might have led him to his breakdown that night, like being left without notice, being cheated on,  etc.. I found out some of it was that he just got to a weird point that made him question things. I let him know the way he went about it fucked with me a lot. I&amp;#39;ve had friends up and leave me, some for some shitty part in my life that I guess overshadowed how they felt about me as a person. Some for being gay. But never was there really an explanation. If there is I can handle it. If there&amp;#39;s rationale I&amp;#39;m coo, whatever it&amp;#39;s sad, it&amp;#39;s gone, but I can manage. If someone leaves my bed at 3 am without saying anything and then texts me they&amp;#39;re not happy with us then no I&amp;#39;ll be spending the next few weeks or months  trying to figure out &lt;strong&gt;what the fuck happened.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even after all this talk, I&amp;#39;m still feeling weird. The last two days we&amp;#39;ve spent a good amount of time together and it&amp;#39;s been nice. I am enjoying it, but then when we&amp;#39;re not together I&amp;#39;m feeling so weird about things. I get sad. I want to smoke like crazy. I want to smoke weed again which I haven&amp;#39;t in a year or so and haven&amp;#39;t wanted to in moooonths. He mentioned that he doesn&amp;#39;t like my smoking (cigarettes) when we were talking that first night. I smoke maybe 3 a day on average but I said I would cut back. I even had already been thinking it would be a good idea because my allergies and a creeping sickness have made breathing hard lately. But now I&amp;#39;ve been hitting my e-cig like crazy and even having a cigarette here and there just to calm my nerves. I generally smoke because I enjoy it and it&amp;#39;s relaxing. Not because I&amp;#39;m anxious!
I just feel... off. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even when he said, over text, that he didn&amp;#39;t know if we were going to work, my thought was &amp;#39;Okay, I guess that&amp;#39;s that.&amp;#39; it was kind of an acceptance. Kind of a &amp;#39;maybe he&amp;#39;s right&amp;#39; and a lot of &amp;#39;fuck him then if he&amp;#39;s going to do it this way and he really doesn&amp;#39;t want to be with me.&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just don&amp;#39;t know where to go from here. I&amp;#39;m confused. I&amp;#39;m new to this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need a fucking outlet. &lt;/p&gt;

Lately I've been trying to make a ton of effort in terms of hanging out with him. We have hung out, but it's usually me suggesting stuff. When we're together, it's great. When we're not together, not so much. We sleep at each other's houses. We've gone on dates.. but lately it just doesn't feel all there. I got really mad at him about a week ago because he wasn't being really responsive to my text messages and how I felt I was asking him too much about hanging out.

This part is going to sound really dumb, but it's kinda hurtful. Tonight we were supposed to watch the new season of Game of Thrones. We've been watching the series together while we've been together. He tells me he can't because he didn't finish watching the previous season, although it's only 2 episodes left, so I told him that we can watch it while we wait for the new episode to come out.. which would have made total sense. He doesn't really reply to me and says he's just in a bad mood. 

He sends me a cheery good morning text today, but then I see that he's going to a convention that he didn't even tell me about.

Using a throwaway..

Anyway, I am a 20 year old bisexual guy who is currently ""seeing"" a 45 year old guy. Firstly, this is something completely new and unexpected for me. This is my first guy-on-guy relationship and I never really expected this because he isn't really my type.

Anyway, we met through scruff and we began chatting for several days (I got tonsillitis and that ruined our plans to hookup, but still continued chatting). When we finally did meet up, all we did was sort of 'light' fun - kissing and sucking - and then snuggled. Since then, we have met up quite often and its just chats, snuggles and kissing. 

So anyway, we decided to chat a bit and like I didn't really want to define anything at the beginning because of the age-gap and this being my first guy relationship. And that was cool, so I first saw it as more of a regular buddy. However, in the recent days, its deepened considerably and then one morning, he called me ""his boyfriend"". Which sort of freaked me out as I saw it as defining something, and then he further freaked me out with ""I am slowly falling in love with you"".

It just felt like really a lot and really suddenly, so I didn't know what to do. We discussed it a bit and he mentioned the idea of an open relationship, which seemed cool at first. However, it seemed to be suggested more for my benefit (high sex drive and me being young) and also when we started talking about what was okay to do with other guys, it was getting complicated with setting what is off limits and what wasn't, and do we play with other guys together or what...

Anyway, this is just doing my head in. First, there is the age gap but I am not really insanely immature and he agrees that I am mature for my age (in terms of thinking). Also, there is the fact that he seems to be way more into me than I am for him at the moment, which might change. 

Any advice? Feel free to ask questions if it was pretty confusing.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey all,&lt;/p&gt;

So I suppose that I wanted to write this partly to vent and partly to see what you guys think. I was recently accepted to my top choice medical school, which has truly been a dream come true. Nothing makes me happier than knowing that I will be able to spend the rest of my life doing something that I not only love, but something that also happens to be incredibly meaningful. 

The only downside is that my partner of four years will not be able to join me as I embark on this next chapter of my life. While I was doing my undergraduate work we already had a semi-long distance relationship (about 1.5 hours apart) for almost two years. That distance was doable and we were still able to see each other pretty often, though there were some minor stresses of course. My new medical school, however, is almost 9 hours away and I doubt that we will be able to see each other nearly as often. 

This is definitely a difficult situation because I care deeply for him, but I don't know how long we are going to be apart for - it could honestly be upwards of 4-6 years. We have talked about it a little bit, and I told him that being that far apart means that I won't be able to achieve the goals that I have set for my life, which include getting married, starting a family, etc. Furthermore, I wouldn't be able to have the *physical* relationship that I believe is very important (and helpful for relieving the stresses of medical school).

I definitely feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place because I do want to stay with him, but doing so would mean that I would have to postpone parts of my ""five year plan."" Even if we did break up I doubt that I would be able to find someone else, establish a relationship, and achieve my goals of having a family within the next five years.

Sorry for the longwinded post, but like I said I kinda needed to vent a little bit. I guess that my question is this - has anyone else been in this type of long distance relationship? What do you think of this difficult situation? Any advice/feedback?

Though the move and distance are daunting, I do find comfort in knowing that I am one step closer towards realizing my dream of becoming a physician. 

Thanks guys,

One thing that worries me though (apart from us only being able to meet once a week, sigh) is his attitude towards sex: he almost never comes and in most cases I am the one initiating things.

Now, this could be down to individual preference; what gets me is that he has had way more experience than me before we met as well as some remarks he made like liking me for my ""innocence"" or his being tired and not wanting to be left alone as he grows older.

My fear is that the reason he chose me is that he fears being alone and I am a good match as I am not threatening more than being attracted by me. I also have to admit I am disappointed someone with way more experience than me isn't interested in teaching/trying things.
