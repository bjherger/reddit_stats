I'm gay. That's the first time Ive ever truly admitted that to myself. The problem is I absolutely hate myself for being gay. It doesn't make sense to me. I have gay friends and it spent bother me at all. But I hate myself for being gay. Now this is where it gets a little more interesting. I'm in love with a guy. He's my best friend and he's gay also. I've know him for two years and about 4 months after being friends we had sex for the first time. I was disgusted with myself for giving in to my gay desires. I started crying after it was over and ran to the bathroom to throw up. At this time he wasn't out to me, in fact he had me convinced (up until the sex making) that he was totally straight. The first time we had sex we were both super high so the next day after I realized I couldn't pretend like nothing happened I told him that we were both just high and that it can't happen again. He agreed and then after we talked a little more we had sex again. After this time though it was different. I didn't feel the need to try and stop it. I just let it happen. We secretly dated I guess for a couple of weeks until the semester was over and we had to go back to our hometowns which are 8 hours apart. After a week of being home we were still constantly talking to eachother flirting and everything. After not seeing him and being thrown back in to my small town Texas life I realized this had to stop, I mean c'mon I wasn't gay. So I sent him a very long text explaining that we had to stop doing what we were doing and just pretend like nothing happened before one us developed feelings for eachother (even though it was clear I had feelings for him and he had feelings for me). He seemed really upset but he kept pretending to be straight and said he agreed even though I knew he was lying. Well our other best friend lives in the same town I'm from so we had already made plans for him to come visit us. And we could just cancel those plans or it may seem suspicious. So he come to visit and he stays at my house because there was nowhere else really. Well we don't really have any guest space at our house being a blended family totally 8 people. So he had to share a bed with me. I remember thinking to myself I can do this. We're friends that's it. WRONG. After the first night I woke up and was just so glad he was there. Just so happy you have no idea. So I cuddled up to him as I normally would and with in minutes we had sex again. I couldn't stop myself. Things were different though. We never talked about our romantic relationship anymore. We just ignored it even though it kept happening. I even drive the 8 hour drive to his town over night just to see him for 48 hours and be with him because of how much I missed him. But we didn't talk about the sex or our feelings. So fall comes back around and me him and our other friend move into an apartment together. I was excited and nervous at the same time. Excited to be with him everyday again and nervous because what if things got bad. We had a lease that can't just end because we ""broke up"". Well it turned into a nightmare that first semester. I had clearly really hurt his feelings by telling him that we had to stop months before. So he was so mean to me for the first 5 months we lived in that apartment. Not because he hated me but because he wanted to stop himself from having feelings for me. Well when we came back from the holiday break it was just him and I in the apartment for a couple of days before our roommate got back. And it happened. We had sex again. I don't even know how to explain how it happend. After that it became a regular thing for us to have sex while our other roommate was out of town (which is more frequent that you think because he visits his girlfriend on a regular basis). Well the sex became less and less frequent even when our roommate was out of town. And it was because he was getting upset we weren't actually moving anywhere. And now it has stopped completey. Skip a couple of months of me desperately wanting to be with him but not being able to accept myself as gay. And I was severely depressed. I wanted to kill myself so badly. Once I actually for scared I might kill myself I told my mom and she made withdrawal for the
University for the semester and move back home to get help. I got help felt a lot better but being home for two months with nothing to do I became dependent on my friends including him. We texted all the time and all the love I had lost over the months of uncertainty came back. Also he came out to everybody. He texted me the night before he told everyone else because he wanted me to know first. Which I could have taken as the perfect opportunity to come out to him. But I didnt. I just couldn't get myself to do it. So now I have moved back into the apartment. He is open now but he doesn't love me anymore. Or if he doesn't he doesn't want to and really wants to move on. In fact he is kinda dating someone else. And he seems to like home but it's moving extremely slow and im wondering if it's because the other guy may not really be into him. But I have to pretend to be happy that he finally is comfortable with everything and is happy with someone because I'm his ""straight"" friend. After battling my depression I want to be happy more than anything and being with him is what I want but there are so many things that are stoping me.

1. I feel like if we did end up dating again it would be totally unfair to him because I'm not 100% ready to be out.

2. My self hatred for being gay translates to my taste in guys. I don't want to be with a flamboyant guy. It honestly repulses me and I hate that it does. So if I don't end up with him than I don't think I will find another guy and I rather not go though the coming out process if that's the case. Save myself some trouble ya know?

3. We still live together and have agreed to move into a house with some other friends next year. If we did get together that could be weird for our roommates and then if the relationship went south it could make for awkward living arrangements. 

So now you know my predicament. And I would love to hear any advice. also sorry if I've blown this up to much I have anxiety disorder so I tend to over think and most of those thoughts tend to be irrational fears.

Won't go into details, but it's prevented me from having a relationship.  I came out when I was 24.  Four years later, I'm now 28 and it's been a tough time for me.  Just FYI, I'm not a virgin, I've had sex a few times with a guy in college who treated me horribly.  Afterwards, I haven't had very much sexual activity with anyone.

This past summer, I had a few dates with someone I met through a phone app, but when we almost got to sex, I started having a major panic attack.  I lied and told him that, ""I'm not just that kind of guy, I need monogamy for sex."" He believed me.  Maybe that's true, I don't really know since I don't have that much experience.

Fast forwards to now, I'm off of any phone apps, no Grindr, Scruff, or Tindr, but I'm on OKCupid.  I'm also trying to go out of my comfort zones and I'm meeting new guys at bars and trying to be more social.  There was a cute guy I met this weekend who I really like.  We've met once before and I feel that we had a connection and he might like me too.  He gave me his number and I texted him. But the thing is, when I'm attracted to someone I get severe PTSD.  I can't explain the feeling, it's more in my body than in my thoughts.  I'm not thinking of anything.  My arms feel numb and I feel sick.  The funny thing is that, it doesn't happen when I'm in public.  It's when I get home I feel like that helpless little kid again.

So long story short, cute guy gives me his number, and I feel like a piece of shit.  I know I have to go through this, a lot of guys have gone through worse.  But I just want to be able to hang out and go on dates, cuz at the end of the day I want to find that special guy and be in a relationship.  But I can come off as a little prudish, and sex before a relationship seems to be the norm. It's true for gay people and straight people.  They have sex and figure out if they can make it work afterwards.

And on a super lonely and horny sunday night like tonight, I just feel so shitty and sad.

Things went relatively well, except for my mom who is supportive but struggling to understand. 

The other day, a family member told me he found out that I'm gay and wanted to know if it was true. He said that he was proud of the way I handle myself around my (sometimes) homophobic family. He said that I had his support no matter what. I told him it was true and asked where he got his information. The kicker was that he refused to tell me who. No matter what I said, he refused to tell me.

It's frustrating because I feel violated on so many levels. Obviously I'm not the first person to be outed to a family member, but I feel like I should be able to know who told a family member something so personal that I wasn't ready to share. Beyond that, it makes the ""support"" feel kind of hollow. I know that it isn't, but I can't shake that feeling. I eventually gave up knowing he wouldn't tell me.

This was about 3 days ago. Tonight, I find out that his wife told another family member, who told my grandparents, who then confronted my parents, who weren't ready to talk about it with them yet. And suddenly I'm at the center of family drama where my grandparents weren't ready to hear or accept this and my parents are mad at the family members who spread this and won't tell their source.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll preface this by saying that I came out to my immediate family less than a month ago.

Long post, but I'd really appreciate it if you could read it. TLDR at the bottom.

So I'm a 16 year old high schooler. I don't mean to bore you with a whole life story, but basically I've known I was gay for pretty much as long as I can remember. Of course, as I'm sure many of you have done, I have dated a few different girls, but we never went very far, the relationships never lasted very long, and obviously they were one-sided relationships. The dating during middle school was just me in denial, the others in high school was just me trying to cover my tracks. But I digress.

One other thing, the only person who I've told about my sexuality is my friend who we'll call Jake. I've known him since I was in elementary school and he has continually shown his support for the LGBT community through out middle/high school. Of course, he is accepting of me, and has been helping me through this journey for the couple months since I told him. This is important later.

So here's the thing. One of my past girlfriends, let's call her Kate, has been developing feelings for me. For the past few weeks, she's been super flirty with me and has been holding my hand and asking me to walk her to track after school. After a week or two of this going on, I asked Jake about it. He told me to try to indirectly let her know I'm not interested. I did this by trying to duck away from her hand when she tried to grab it and say ""I don't know"" when she asked me to walk her to the gym after school. She apparently didn't get the message.

I may have inadvertently made the whole situation worse a week or two ago by buying her gummy worms at the store near our school when she asked me to because I was going there anyway and because I'm a decent person. I brought them back to the school to her and she hugged me and told me she loved me (I'm still not sure if she meant it ""that"" way). I kind of nodded and said ""no problem"", then left to go home.

We have a school dance coming up in February, and obviously, the girls are going nuts over who is bringing who. So the other night I was surfing the web on my laptop when my phone rang. It was Kate. I picked it up and said hey and she says, ""so, it took me a while to build up the courage to ask you this, but will you go to the dance with me?"". I explained that I would if I wasn't going skiing that weekend (I am), and that it was a no, sorry. She said, ""no, don't be sorry"" then immediately hung up. I felt like an awful piece of shit. She sounded crushed when I told her no.

I messaged Jake and told him what happened. He told me that if I wanted him to, he could talk to her and kind of nonchalantly tell her that I wasn't interested. I told him not to because I think she would feel even worse to know that I'm too much of a pussy to tell her myself.

Kate has always been kind of clingy. She is incredibly emotionally unstable when it comes to boys, like most teenage girls are. She was super sad and kind of even depressed the last time she got rejected by a crush, and I just can't put her through that again. I can't out myself to her because she has proven to be too unreliable with secrets in the past, and I'm just not emotionally ready to be out to my entire school. Jake hasn't come up with any viable ways to diffuse this situation, and neither have I.

I need help. I'm in a corner here and I don't know what to do.

***TLDR:*** Clingy (but really nice) girl has crush on me as a closeted gay guy, and I may have inadvertently led her on. She asked me to the dance and was crushed when I said no because I was going to be away that weekend.

So I have a friend who's also gay. We've hung out a bunch of times. Usually just chatting, playing video games, and smoking weed. I think he's really cute and I want to try and become more than just friends. However I have no idea if he wants the same.

So tonight after we hung out and he about to leave, I only gave him a hug. But there was something in the way we made eye contact that made me wonder, would he have let me kiss him? But like I said, I have no idea if he wants to go into sexual, or romantic, territory with me. I was kinda kicking myself after he'd left that I didn't try to kiss him - or even ask him if I could.

That got me thinking, is it weird or awkward to ask someone for their consent to a kiss? Is that actually preferred? I've felt that sinking feeling in one's gut when you go in for a kiss and get rejected. And I definitely don't want to feel it with my friend, or strain our friendship by suddenly trying to kiss him against his will.

Next time we hang out one-on-one, should I ask if it's OK to kiss him? Or just go for it in a more subtle way? Your advice is appreciated!

(By the way, it's not like I've never went in for the kiss without asking and it was reciprocated before.

Sorry if this comes across as  offensive. 

Where do I begin...? I guess I came to the realization that I was attracted to guys about six-seven years ago, though I mostly thought it was a phase what with hormones and all. As with many other guys around this sub I gradually started to think that I might be bisexual. A couple of years pass; feelings for girls begin to wane. The notion of being gay is still out of the picture. High school comes and goes, stronger feelings for guys develop, it no longer seems like a phase. I sort of accept that I'm most likely not straight.

I wouldn't think I'm depressed. I'm simply not happy anymore. This seemingly insignificant preference of mine is disproportionally affecting me negatively. I used to be a *very* talkative and outgoing kid, but not anymore. Friends, family and relatives have noticed that for years and they jokingly bring up how I must've ""consumed all your words"" when I was little. I've found myself increasingly keeping to myself and becoming more platonic with people. I'm cautious of what I say, do, write, move, etc. My self-confidence has plummeted. I feel like I no longer develop as a person, that I'm just waiting for time to go by, like I'm shackled.

Some days these thoughts occupy my mind for hours on end and that makes me feel even worse about it. I can't see myself being gay in the future. I run through all kinds of scenarios in my mind: finding a partner, traveling the world, settling down. While that potentially could be lovely, I have a hard time putting myself in those shoes, like that's not the way for me to go. 

I have no idea what do to at this time. Even though it probably be the best for me, coming out is out of the question – I'm not at all comfortable talking about these things. Not that I think my parents or friends would have a problem with me being gay (or bi, heavily leaning gay). At the same time, continuing on the path I'm currently headed seems equally bad. 

I'm mostly wondering if there is anyone around here who if just remotely can relate to what I'm going through. How do you deal with the perpetual gloom of being closeted, wasting and watching life pass by? 

I'm sorry if this is an incomprehensible mess. Putting words to years of bent-up thoughts and feelings was very difficult.

This got a LOT more attention than I ever thought it would. I assumed it would be downvoted into oblivion because of the whole ""I snuck into the ipad"" thing. 

That subject got a LOT of discussion, more than I've seen in most r/askgaybros posts, so I want you guys to continue that. To all the people who say ""snooping is just as bad as cheating"" I ask you:

If you are in a relationship with someone who you suspect is not telling you the truth about cheating, how do you confirm or deny it?

Does insecurity play into this? Oh yes, most definitely. I'm insecure at the moment. I think anyone who is not feeling quite right about his or her relationship is going to be insecure by default. The thing that bugs me is that most people say ""insecurity"" like its an incurable disease. ""Oh he's just *insecure*"" As if it's never going to change. 

But it's been my experience as a person living on the Earth that people go through cycles of security and insecurity. And insecurity is not always a bad thing. I've made some of my greatest leaps forward, both personal and career-wise, while riddled with absolute, nearly crippling insecurity. 

And that's kind of what happened last night. The situation is still there, and although I do still feel bad, cheated, unhappy, and generally shell-shocked, I also had the most frank, open, and (I believe) honest conversation with my boyfriend that has ever happened in our relationship.

Here’s what went down, and I hope you’ll leave your judgment at the door, because if you’re rolling your eyes at what you’re reading, then stop. Leave this post, turn off your computer and go outside or something. Because this isn’t for you. 

So, I spent the entire day before the dinner obsessing over a project. I’m working on self-publishing a book, but that doesn’t really matter. The hours actually passed really fast, too fast for me to feel prepared for the inevitably shitty conversation I needed to have. 

I texted him while he was out and suggested we have dinner at a nearby restaurant. I highly suggest having these kinds of conversation in a semi-public place so it doesn’t devolve into a yelling match. I know this is r/askgaybros and the general theme is to be “masc” but I think we’d all be lying if we said our feelings never got away from us before.

My boyfriend had a pretty awesome day at work and burst into the apartment with his excitement level at about 90%. Thank God, I thought, he’ll be way too distracted to notice anything’s wrong before dinner. 

But I guess 6+ years of sharing a bed had improved his perception of me. The second he got a glance at my face he said, “What’s wrong?” 

I brushed it off, saying I was frustrated with work. I must have really looked like shit because he pressed the issue all the way to the restaurant. It took all that I had to not have it out right there on the sidewalk, but that wouldn’t have been the right environment at all. 

We sat down and barely got around to ordering. He was insistent now. 

“I want you to tell me what’s wrong.” He said the moment the waitress was away.
	
I don’t think I can recreate the conversation verbatim, but when I’m fairly sure of what was said I’ll include it. 

I said yes, there was a problem and I said, “I want to you to tell me the truth about what happened between you and the guy you met on Thursday.”

He’s got about the best poker face I’ve ever seen, but his eyes twitched just the slightest bit. He was trying to figure out if I actually knew something or if I was just going on instinct. He didn’t reply for a long time. 

“Please,” I was almost begging now, “just tell me the truth. I want to know the truth. It would mean so much if you just tell me the truth.”

Instead of the truth, he went with his lie. “Nothing happened, I told you. We went to a bar and had some drinks and talked.”

I remember feeling like I had deflated like a balloon. It would have meant so much if he had dropped the lie right then and come clean, but he didn’t. 

So, I told him that I knew that he was lying. He asked as why I was asking about this. So I told him that I knew the code on the Ipad and had read his text messages. 

“Okay, so we sent dick pics to each other,” he was defensive. 

“You didn’t only do that. You made out with him until eleven o’clock at night in a gay bar. I asked you point blank if this guy was gay and if you guys had gone to a gay bar and you told me 'no, he’s straight, we went to a straight bar'."" 

“Well, I didn’t know he was gay until we met.”

I told him that was bullshit too. He had clearly indicated in the text messages that they would be meeting at a gay bar. 

“Well,” he kept saying ‘well’ maybe because it gave him some more time to come up with something to say, “I don’t know if it matters, but he made the move on me first.”

I told him that he was right, it didn’t matter. Because it hadn’t been some innocent kiss or anything. It had been a full-on sexually charged meeting that he had been planning behind my back. Then, it had continued the next day with the dick pic exchange and him inviting this random guy from Twitter to come suck his cock. Then, on top of all of that, he had invited this guy to the concert we had gone to on Friday, where I would also be. 

He replied that the guy was actually part of a work-related network and he had invited multiple people from said network to go to the concert, not just him. Sorry if that’s confusing, but I can’t really explain it without possibly revealing someone’s identity. 

I said, whoa, back the eff up, this person is a work colleague? You’re using your work network as a dating site? That seemed incredibly unprofessional to me. He agreed and something about that changed his attitude. It was as if he finally realized “oh, maybe I actually did something wrong”. 

The waitress came by at regular intervals to refill water and give us our meals. This was probably the biggest lifesaver. It helped us keep the conversation as civil and rational as possible. 

“I don’t feel like I really have a leg to stand on,” he said. 

“That’s because you don’t,” I replied.

I asked him if we were in a monogamous relationship. I asked him if he desired an open relationship. I asked him if he even wanted to continue a relationship with me. All of his answers were yes, he wanted a monogamous relationship with just me. 

So, I asked him why. Why did he seek out another man? He got quiet for a bit and then said it was because “We don’t have enough sex.”

So, I countered, you are telling me that you think it’s okay for a person in a monogamous relationship to go out and find a random stranger (and yes, although they were in the same work network, technically this person was a stranger. They had been chatting for less than a week.) and make out, send dick pics, and invite them to come have sex? And then, on top of that, lie to your partner about it all when he pointedly asks? 

“No, of course not,” he replied.

I told him exactly what I thought about that paper-thin excuse. He hasn’t said a single word to me about sex. He hasn’t communicated with me that he is unsatisfied with our sex life. Why, I asked, haven’t you approached me with this? 

Should I have inferred that he wasn’t satisfied? Maybe. I knew our sex was at a low point, but not necessarily at an all-time-low. 

I told him that I have absolutely no desire to have sex with someone who is going to lie and cheat on me. Other guys might be able to put all of their emotions completely to the side and fuck whoever, however, whenever they want. Maybe I could do that with a stranger, but certainly not someone I had put six years of trust into. 

I told him if sex was his only problem then we might as well just break up right now, because it probably wasn’t going to be something that was fixed in the near future. He had completely violated my trust, lied, snuck around behind my back, and I couldn’t even imagine wanting to have sex with him right now. I told him that I wanted to leave, that night, and go sleep somewhere else. 

“I don’t want you to do that,” he said. 

“Why? If I’m hearing you correctly, then having the right kind of sex is more important to you than a six-year relationship. If that’s the truth, then that’s fine. I won’t judge. If there’s genuinely something that you need that I just can’t give you then I want you to have it.” But I did add that I thought if sex was the deal breaker to an otherwise great relationship then perhaps he needed to reexamine his priorities. Should I have said this? Probably not. Probably this will open up a whole other heated discussion on if and how sex is the cornerstone of a relationship. To that I say, have at it. Discuss below, I'd love to read it. 

What is healthy sex for a couple who’s been in a long-term relationship? I'm the other people currently in long-term relationships. What do you do when that initial attraction dulls? 

He said “No, you’re not hearing me correctly.” So I asked him to explain.

He said that there were reasons why he didn’t want to approach me about sex. We’re on different work schedules, so he goes to sleep a lot later than I do. When he wants to have sex isn’t when I want to have sex. I agreed with that point and said that it’s something that could be worked on, theoretically, but it would still take some time because I wasn’t going to be over him ‘cheating’ instantly. 

I said ""cheating"" and he replied that he didn’t think that what he did was ‘cheating’. They never had penetrative sex, so it wasn't like he cheated on me.

&lt;p&gt;My boyfriend had a pretty awesome day at work and burst into the apartment with his excitement level at about 90%. Thank God, I thought, he’ll be way too distracted to notice anything’s wrong before dinner. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I guess 6+ years of sharing a bed had improved his perception of me. The second he got a glance at my face he said, “What’s wrong?” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I brushed it off, saying I was frustrated with work. I must have really looked like shit because he pressed the issue all the way to the restaurant. It took all that I had to not have it out right there on the sidewalk, but that wouldn’t have been the right environment at all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We sat down and barely got around to ordering. He was insistent now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I want you to tell me what’s wrong.” He said the moment the waitress was away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think I can recreate the conversation verbatim, but when I’m fairly sure of what was said I’ll include it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I said yes, there was a problem and I said, “I want to you to tell me the truth about what happened between you and the guy you met on Thursday.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He’s got about the best poker face I’ve ever seen, but his eyes twitched just the slightest bit. He was trying to figure out if I actually knew something or if I was just going on instinct. He didn’t reply for a long time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Please,” I was almost begging now, “just tell me the truth. I want to know the truth. It would mean so much if you just tell me the truth.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of the truth, he went with his lie. “Nothing happened, I told you. We went to a bar and had some drinks and talked.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember feeling like I had deflated like a balloon. It would have meant so much if he had dropped the lie right then and come clean, but he didn’t. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I told him that I knew that he was lying. He asked as why I was asking about this. So I told him that I knew the code on the Ipad and had read his text messages. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Okay, so we sent dick pics to each other,” he was defensive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You didn’t only do that. You made out with him until eleven o’clock at night in a gay bar. I asked you point blank if this guy was gay and if you guys had gone to a gay bar and you told me &amp;#39;no, he’s straight, we went to a straight bar&amp;#39;.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well, I didn’t know he was gay until we met.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told him that was bullshit too. He had clearly indicated in the text messages that they would be meeting at a gay bar. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well,” he kept saying ‘well’ maybe because it gave him some more time to come up with something to say, “I don’t know if it matters, but he made the move on me first.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told him that he was right, it didn’t matter. Because it hadn’t been some innocent kiss or anything. It had been a full-on sexually charged meeting that he had been planning behind my back. Then, it had continued the next day with the dick pic exchange and him inviting this random guy from Twitter to come suck his cock. Then, on top of all of that, he had invited this guy to the concert we had gone to on Friday, where I would also be. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He replied that the guy was actually part of a work-related network and he had invited multiple people from said network to go to the concert, not just him. Sorry if that’s confusing, but I can’t really explain it without possibly revealing someone’s identity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I said, whoa, back the eff up, this person is a work colleague? You’re using your work network as a dating site? That seemed incredibly unprofessional to me. He agreed and something about that changed his attitude. It was as if he finally realized “oh, maybe I actually did something wrong”. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The waitress came by at regular intervals to refill water and give us our meals. This was probably the biggest lifesaver. It helped us keep the conversation as civil and rational as possible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I don’t feel like I really have a leg to stand on,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That’s because you don’t,” I replied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked him if we were in a monogamous relationship. I asked him if he desired an open relationship. I asked him if he even wanted to continue a relationship with me. All of his answers were yes, he wanted a monogamous relationship with just me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I asked him why. Why did he seek out another man? He got quiet for a bit and then said it was because “We don’t have enough sex.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I countered, you are telling me that you think it’s okay for a person in a monogamous relationship to go out and find a random stranger (and yes, although they were in the same work network, technically this person was a stranger. They had been chatting for less than a week.) and make out, send dick pics, and invite them to come have sex? And then, on top of that, lie to your partner about it all when he pointedly asks? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No, of course not,” he replied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told him exactly what I thought about that paper-thin excuse. He hasn’t said a single word to me about sex. He hasn’t communicated with me that he is unsatisfied with our sex life. Why, I asked, haven’t you approached me with this? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should I have inferred that he wasn’t satisfied? Maybe. I knew our sex was at a low point, but not necessarily at an all-time-low. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told him that I have absolutely no desire to have sex with someone who is going to lie and cheat on me. Other guys might be able to put all of their emotions completely to the side and fuck whoever, however, whenever they want. Maybe I could do that with a stranger, but certainly not someone I had put six years of trust into. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told him if sex was his only problem then we might as well just break up right now, because it probably wasn’t going to be something that was fixed in the near future. He had completely violated my trust, lied, snuck around behind my back, and I couldn’t even imagine wanting to have sex with him right now. I told him that I wanted to leave, that night, and go sleep somewhere else. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I don’t want you to do that,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Why? If I’m hearing you correctly, then having the right kind of sex is more important to you than a six-year relationship. If that’s the truth, then that’s fine. I won’t judge. If there’s genuinely something that you need that I just can’t give you then I want you to have it.” But I did add that I thought if sex was the deal breaker to an otherwise great relationship then perhaps he needed to reexamine his priorities. Should I have said this? Probably not. Probably this will open up a whole other heated discussion on if and how sex is the cornerstone of a relationship. To that I say, have at it. Discuss below, I&amp;#39;d love to read it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is healthy sex for a couple who’s been in a long-term relationship? I&amp;#39;m the other people currently in long-term relationships. What do you do when that initial attraction dulls? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said “No, you’re not hearing me correctly.” So I asked him to explain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said that there were reasons why he didn’t want to approach me about sex. We’re on different work schedules, so he goes to sleep a lot later than I do. When he wants to have sex isn’t when I want to have sex. I agreed with that point and said that it’s something that could be worked on, theoretically, but it would still take some time because I wasn’t going to be over him ‘cheating’ instantly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I said &amp;quot;cheating&amp;quot; and he replied that he didn’t think that what he did was ‘cheating’. They never had penetrative sex, so it wasn&amp;#39;t like he cheated on me.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Me:

I’m male, in my early 20s, financially independent but living with my parents due to family issues (I pay my share of the rent/utilities/expenses.) After realizing in high school that I’m not straight, beating myself up mentally for nearly seven years and emerging through a long period of self-loathing, I have come to accept my bisexuality. I know I want to be in a long-term, monogamous relationship in the future, with kids. Whether I end up with a man or a woman remains to be seen, and doesn’t matter to me honestly.

I’m out to a few close friends, and I’d be so happy if I could just come clean with my parents. Every now and then, my parents and I have conversations about homosexuality. I use these conversations to gauge where they stand on the issue, and to test the waters to possibly come out to them. Not that I'm trying to equate homosexuality and bisexuality, by the way, but I still think it's a fairly accurate measure of their stance.

My dad I know would take things in stride. My mom is the problem. I’ll explain below.

------------------------------------
Context:

Today, we had a family movie night. We saw “The Imitation Game.” During the movie, my mother, who was sitting next to me, kept expressing non-verbal sympathy for what happens to Turing; she had tears in her eyes at the end, and audibly gasped when he reveals that he’s being chemically castrated. As we were walking out, she told me it was disgraceful how he and other homosexuals were treated.

On the ride back home in the car, we began talking about homosexuality and whether it’s “right” or “wrong.” Our conversations on this topic always follow a predictable, frustrating pattern as far as my mom is concerned. She vacillates between “being gay isn’t wrong” and “being gay is unnatural;” she starts off very open-minded but as the conversation goes on you can hear her convincing herself that it’s not natural. These conversations always end up getting dropped, and it depresses me because I feel in the beginning that I can be open with her and eventually come out to her, only to have my hopes crushed.

This time, it started out the same way. She kept saying how sorry she felt for how Turing was treated, and expressed sympathy that his childhood companion had died. But then she kept asking herself, as she usually does, ""But it can't be natural, can it? It's not *really* right, right?"" 

This time, I pushed her. When she got to convincing herself again that being gay is unnatural, I asked her why. After getting a few noncommittal replies, I asked her if it was about procreation and children. She said yes, then abruptly brought up Neil Patrick Harris and David Burtka. She said that they had fathered children who were biologically theirs, but how are they going to field awkward questions from the kids? “What if they go to school and realize that their classmates have a mommy and a daddy? How are you going to respond to them?”

I replied that there are plenty of kids who grow up in unconventional parental situations—single parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles, miscellaneous guardians—who turn out fine, that economic and familial stability was more important to kids’ well-being than their parents’ orientations, and that most kids would happily accept that some families have a mommy and a daddy while others have two mommies or two daddies, etc.

*Then she said something that has, I’ll admit, haunted me for a long time*, and I hope I can get some advice from you all reading this on how to deal with it. She said, “How is it fair to knowingly deprive a child of a mother and a father, to knowingly bring it into this world and condemn it to a life where it faces internal confusion and external discrimination? How would the child feel knowing that its biological mother gave it up to be raised by two men?”

My response was: If the choice is between not bringing the child into the world at all and bringing it to be raised by two loving, stable, committed parents who want the child, then the latter choice is, to me, the obvious one, and the sex/orientation of the parents means nothing. The child will grow up loved. I don't see how this is ""condemning"" the child at all.

…But is that true?

I’m trying to put myself in such a child’s place. Despite having two loving dads, would I be sad knowing that my biological mom only birthed me to give me away? I have a hard time saying no. But the same thing applies to any kid that’s ever been adopted, and I don’t see people calling for adoption to be banned. *Right??*

My mom then brought up evolution. She said, “I don’t understand why homosexuality exists if it isn’t evolutionarily beneficial to humans. Every lock has a key, and the goal is to survive and make offspring; how can homosexuality exist in this context?”

I replied that natural selection by definition get rid of traits that are maladaptive, and the fact that homosexuality hasn’t been stamped out means that, at worst, it isn’t detrimental to humans’ long-term survival as a species, and at best, may have ancillary benefits that we’re not quite sure of yet. I said that I don’t think anyone really knows for sure why homosexuality exists, but it does, and it’s immutable, like skin color, and to treat someone cruelly because of it is just wrong.

Then she said that she doesn’t even fully buy that it’s natural. She brings up an anecdote that every gay gay she personally knows of has had an overbearing mother/absent father/doting sisters type situation. I replied that a) why the hell would anyone voluntarily CHOOSE to be discriminated so cruelly against, and b) there are probably plenty of gay guys out there who didn’t have any of these situations, but because I don’t know any specific examples, it sounded weak to me. Just for context: my dad wasn’t around for much of my childhood, but I don’t consider this for one second to be “what made me bi” or anything; however, I’m terrified that if I come out, my mom will beat herself up thinking it’s her “fault” or something.

...And that’s where we sort of dropped it. Like I said, it frustrates me so much, because I so very much want to be open with my mom, but she can’t bring herself to accept that homosexuality/bisexuality is natural. It also doesn't help that her point about ""is it fair to the child"" bothers me more than I'd like to admit.

I don't really have a clear question to ask you guys. I'm just hoping that some of you have been through the same discussions and have some insight to impart.

Thank you for reading if you got this far. I’m sorry if this was a bit too stream-of-consciousness; I just really needed to get this off my mind.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure if I’m asking for advice or just need someone to hear (see?) my thoughts, because there really isn’t anyone in my personal life I can turn to about this stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

But the same thing applies to any kid that’s ever been adopted, and I don’t see people calling for adoption to be banned. &lt;em&gt;Right??&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mom then brought up evolution. She said, “I don’t understand why homosexuality exists if it isn’t evolutionarily beneficial to humans. Every lock has a key, and the goal is to survive and make offspring; how can homosexuality exist in this context?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I replied that natural selection by definition get rid of traits that are maladaptive, and the fact that homosexuality hasn’t been stamped out means that, at worst, it isn’t detrimental to humans’ long-term survival as a species, and at best, may have ancillary benefits that we’re not quite sure of yet. I said that I don’t think anyone really knows for sure why homosexuality exists, but it does, and it’s immutable, like skin color, and to treat someone cruelly because of it is just wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then she said that she doesn’t even fully buy that it’s natural. She brings up an anecdote that every gay gay she personally knows of has had an overbearing mother/absent father/doting sisters type situation. I replied that a) why the hell would anyone voluntarily CHOOSE to be discriminated so cruelly against, and b) there are probably plenty of gay guys out there who didn’t have any of these situations, but because I don’t know any specific examples, it sounded weak to me. Just for context: my dad wasn’t around for much of my childhood, but I don’t consider this for one second to be “what made me bi” or anything; however, I’m terrified that if I come out, my mom will beat herself up thinking it’s her “fault” or something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...And that’s where we sort of dropped it. Like I said, it frustrates me so much, because I so very much want to be open with my mom, but she can’t bring herself to accept that homosexuality/bisexuality is natural. It also doesn&amp;#39;t help that her point about &amp;quot;is it fair to the child&amp;quot; bothers me more than I&amp;#39;d like to admit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t really have a clear question to ask you guys. I&amp;#39;m just hoping that some of you have been through the same discussions and have some insight to impart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading if you got this far. I’m sorry if this was a bit too stream-of-consciousness; I just really needed to get this off my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
