Alright, first off I have to say that I'm sorry for posting this admittedly juvenile stuff. And believe me, it does get juvenile. I'm not expecting anyone to read this, but if you do, thanks for making it to the end. I'll try to write a TL;DR at the end, but it's annoyingly multi-faceted that it probably won't capture the issue fully.

So:

I have two friends, I'll call Kate, and the other I'll call Tom. We're all 19, all took a gap year, all went to high school together. I've known Kate for about 7 years and have been on and off again friends, and I've known Tom for 5 years and have pretty much been best friends the whole time. I do things with Tom regularly, but only do things with Kate when with Tom (though we're all friends in our own right). I don't want to sound like I'm exaggerating or romanticising, but Tom and I were basically like an old married couple (no kind of attraction there, it's not that kind of story) and were similar people... though he swung more in Kate's direction and so became better friends with her. 

Since we finished Year 12 (final year of HS), we've been... bored. And apparently some of us handle that differently to others. Kate and Tom took to driving around town looking for entertainment... and in a town as relatively small as ours and at dinner time onwards, there's not much to do. I don't like this pastime. It's a waste of fuel, it's a waste of time and since we can't all go in the same car, we can't all socialise together as was the entire point of driving aimlessly around town. Since those two live closer together and enjoy the same kind of... light-hearted, silly joking, things revolve around them and I resort to following along. Which is obviously tedious. So I decline this activity more and more, because I find it to be wasteful and it makes me feel like the third wheel, basically. It's a bit important to the story here that I'm extremely socially inept, I have a massive fear of abandonment and I have a shitload of insecurities (a lot of them specifically to do with friends). Call it overly sensitive if you want, but being led around like this, feeling like a secondary friend, an optional extra, and feeling like the butt of a joke trips up on some of my insecurities. 

So since I bow out of this... pastime, they try to engage me in other ways. Namely, they drop by my house to give me random shit as 'presents'. They call me and nag for me to come out. They do stuff to my car while I'm at work. I'm trying to keep it neutral, but honestly, it's childish. I still indulge them _sometimes_ (and this is condensed for the sake of the story, but these feelings kinda grew over the course of months). Feeling like I'm secondary to their primary relationship creates a kinda positive feedback loop. I feel left out, so I stay quiet more often and I acquiesce more often, which in turn makes me feel yet more secondary. So with Kate and Tom more actively socialising by far, the feeling that I was being replaced took a toll on me. I basically I felt like I'd lost the closest friend I could relate to in favour of another incompatible half-friend. 

Anyway... serious problems begin to develop from here. First and foremost, I start to develop pretty heavy depression. Suicide ideation and whatnot. I prefer to stay in even more, I feel tired all the time, my sleeping patterns are absolutely, positively fucked and I'm irritable and difficult to get along with in general. I start to think that a holiday would be good for me. Tom had been thinking the same thing, so we book a trip to Bali. The trip was about 8 months in advance, so we had plenty of time to plan.

About 2 months out from the Bali trip, we decide, fuck it, let's go on another holiday soon. Work had been tiring me out and I'd been getting much worse. I hadn't told either of them anything about my mental state, at this point. So we go on a cruise about a week after we make that decision. The cruise was three nights... and for some reason, Tom barely, barely spoke to me the whole time. The cruise had been his idea, I'd never gone on one before. So I felt out of my depth (heh) and weirded out that my best friend just suddenly stopped talking to me when we were going to be spending the next three days together (relatively). So we spend most of the cruise apart. I end up just reading on the upper deck or watching movies in the cabin (which he disagreed with, since it was a waste of money to just be laying about). I go to some shows and stuff (half of which I didn't really like) because I felt bad about being so inactive. I also sleep a lot, since again, sleeping patterns. 

So the cruise was pretty much ruined IMO. He literally talked to his brother on the phone more than he talked to me. Everything he said was short, terse and uncaring (""_I'm_ going to do this. Bye""). When we went to dinner, he'd just text his brother the entire time. I spent the whole time worrying about what I'd done to upset him (again, insecure about friendships) and angry about feeling as such. It was frustrating. The two hour car ride home was completely, completely silent. 

So three days after that... he texts me and cancels the Bali trip. The one I'd been building up for months, and the one I was now looking forward to to salvage my gap year in terms of a break. When I ask him why, he blows me off, says it's because he wants to go with family instead and basically says that it's all in my head when I bring up the silent cruise. Fucking weird. Anyway. We barely spoke for a month after that. I was extremely confused, extremely worried, extremely pissed and extremely depressed. We eventually start talking again, but only because I text him to ask for my money back. Friendship quietens down further at this point. We see each other maybe one a fortnight instead of once every couple of days, I text less often. 

So fast forward a while... he goes on the Bali holiday, I try to forgive him and barely mention it. At this time, my gap year is in it's last quarter and I'm looking into accommodation for 2015. I end up deciding that Kate and I will move in together into a sharehouse type deal. We go along with this for a while, kinda planning, buying some things. Nothing too bad. We then get into a massive argument about some details of the house (she argued that everything we bought was 'public property', I argued that we were all responsible for the things we bought, we were both stubborn, she invited another person to live with us, things got tense, I felt like I was getting the blame for things, etc). This was on the same day that I went to my GP to get a referral for mental health care. It was a tense, tense day for me because I have extreme difficulty opening up about this stuff. I got mad and emotional. So, long story short, I backed out and applied for on campus. I eventually let it go. Water under the bridge. 

I try rebuilding my relationship with Kate at this point. My attempts at socialising are pretty one-sided: she replies in short messages, always late, never suggests to do anything with me, always blows off plans and even fucking moves to a different city without saying a word. 


Somewhere in here I tell Tom I've been having some problems, and tell him I'm going to my doctor for depression. He expresses sympathy, tells me he's there if I want to talk, and it's not spoken of or considered again. I should clarify that my mental issues aren't rooted in this friendship bullshit... they're based around my self-worth and whatnot. The friendship issues just further diminish my self worth because I don't feel like I'm worthy of being a friend, and so contribute to my diminishing mental health. 

Anyway... so Tom gets back from his holiday... and immediately goes on a spontaneous trip to another state with Kate. They send me Snapchats and call me from the car to inform me of this in a completely patronising manner. So at this point, I decide to cut contact. I'm sick of the games, sick of the silly senses of humour, sick of being the butt of jokes and the subject of sport, sick of being jerked around when I _try_ to be an active friend, sick of worrying what _I'm_ doing wrong and sick of being made out to be the bad guy. Maybe it's just my messed up brain, but I feel like no matter what I do, I'm always considered secondary. So I block their snapchats, I respond with one word answer and I focus on getting myself together. To limited success. This goes on for... a month or two.

Anyway, tonight they decide to have it out with me. Ambush me after work, and try to 'socialise' with me (which involved talking to each other about all the shit they do together while I stand there awkwardly and want to be somewhere else). So I leave, and then they start arguing with me on Facebook. Funnily enough, the conversation started with ""we're just wondering what's up with you"". I lay out how I feel (I'd actually done this somewhat before re the stupid outings, but got nowhere). And then they get defensive, have a go at me, tell me that I have to compromise, tell me that I can't expect people to do what I want them to (I specifically said that I dropped out of the friendship because it was easier than forcing a change). They come out of the blue with:

*""Look ____ we have put up with years of you judging, ridiculing and belittling us yet you can't try to work anything out when its us making you uncomfortable? Doesn't seem fair""
*
At this point they have argued every point of my explanation (everything except for the depression stuff, which I haven't brought up yet). They tell me they understand ""a tiny, tiny bit but blah blah blah"". So, in short, they make no effort to understand where I'm coming from and take no responsibility for how they act and how it affects me. Now I know I can be difficult to get along with. I'm no saint... but this devolves into an argument that puts _me_ on the defensive when I was asked how _I felt_ in the first place. Jesus. 

Throughout the conversation, they express exasperation and frustration (""*omfg*"", ""*this is a joke*"", *""for the love of god*"") whereas I kept a cool head. I eventually snap, tell them that my depression is a big reason I have no patience for them (not quite true, they're annoying enough in their own right) and needed space. This is met with a so-so response (Tom's now forgotten that I previously told him), then the conversation turns to that. Everyone expresses sympathy, says they're there, and all that crap. But honestly, as emotional as I got in the depression segment of the conversation, I'm angrier about the rest of it. Not only have I put up with months of subtle, thoughtless crap from them, but they completely deny responsibility and turn the issue back to me. It's a recurring theme with Kate... I'm being made out to be the bad guy in all this. When I cut ties, I just wanted to be left alone. I needed space, I didn't need them contributing to my negative mental outlook. And moreover, I was just sick and tired of their antics. But apparently that's a slight on them. So...

Fuck. I don't know what to think, and I don't know where this leaves me. On one hand, they have pissed me off so much for the past 8 months. Especially Tom and his holiday bullshit that really hurt me. On the other hand, they were good about the depression stuff. I'm angry about the whole conversation as a whole. I'm angry about having to defend myself, I'm angry about having to 'come out' with my depression as a way of defending myself when every other thought is being systematically invalidated. 

If anyone made it this far... thoughts? (Fuuuuuck this is long).

Disclaimers: I'm aware of my own problems and I'm aware of how stupid this is, so if you want to have a go at me for them, please have an ulterior point.

* after using tinder, I talked to a few guys, and I didn't feel anything towards them, and I felt so shallow because of it...

Is there something wrong with me?  I mean... every time I get ghosted, or rejected, or rejected then ghosted, it feels like it's because of something I did or because of some flaw in me as a person... and it's making me really depressed.

So basically, I get horny with men. Sure, I get a hard-on with women, too, especially if they're older than me, like 35~ but if it came to naked young women to naked young men, I'd go with the latter. However, when it comes to dating, I really feel better interacting with women. I just find their company so warm. I'm more attracted to girls this way.

Felt this since I was in high school. Fast forward a decade, I'm now 25, and I'm still unsure. Tried dating men (quite a few hehe. Nope, no sexual contact with those men I dated) but it didn't feel good. I felt awkward - not because of any external pressure mind you, it just felt weird and off and unnatural for me. (I do have a lot of guy mates, no problem whatsoever interacting with them) Women, though, I had a blast with the dates I've had with them (apart from a few. they can be really picky and outright irrational), from the movies, to the long chats, to the kisses in front of the door (gawrsh, the kisses, loved them)... but when it came to sex, that fiery spark - yeah sure, still there but - was somehow diminished, quite heavily.

Over the past couple of months I've been combing the web for studies, sources and articles on LGBT phenomena for a new reddit project, but I need your help!


My project is focused on education and information, it will be a sub which focuses on the study of LGBTQI phenomena on a scientific, biological, neurological, psychological or sociological level, broken down into the relevant categories, and hopefully if all goes to plan it will grow to become the single best one-stop-shop for such education and information in the world! It's not like there is currently much competition! I like to dream big and am fully committed to this project since I just lost my job and have nothing to do. 


I believe every person, LGBTQI or otherwise, deserves access to quality, unbiased information on LGBTQI phenomena and things like HIV from an their perspective. I believe governments and schools around the world are drastically failing the people with this. I believe until people have a real education and understanding of LGBTQI people, true equality will always be a pipe dream. I believe this is the next step for the community and is massively over due.


I believe in empowerment through education. I believe the studies and sources scattered around the internet need to be collectivised into a one-stop-shop to provide a coherent consensus and curriculum for LGBTQI or non-LGBTQI persons to access and gain the education denied to them in schools, libraries and elsewhere. I believe the format of reddit subreddits are perfectly suited for collectivising and organising the material. 

I am asking everyone in the community to come together and share any studies, sources, articles and any other resources you can think of which have helped you personally, elevated your understanding in some way or otherwise stuck in your mind. 



I'm hoping everyone can come together and chip in their piece, and together we can build the biggest and best database of LGBTQI information in the world! Which everyone can benefit from and enjoy. 


 In doing so I want to provide a trapdoor for those who live in repressive regimes in Asia, Africa, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, Russia, South America  and elsewhere to get access to the quality education and information they are entitled to and deserve. 

I want to deliver the smoking gun to myths, ignorance and prejudice in the form of an easily accessible database of facts and legitimate studies and sources which can also be used as a quick and easy resource for references in debates. I want this to be a community project which belongs to the community.


The sub will be dedicated to strict quality control. I want it to have a reputation for being unbiased, no-nonsense, politically neutral and trust worthy when it comes to accessing quality, valid studies, sources and articles from legitimate bodies and websites. 

Subsequently, I am also looking for expert users to mod this sub; people who study genetics, biology, neuroscience, evolutionary psychology, and similar relevant fields. 


I am looking for homosexual, bisexual, transgender, gender queer, asexual and intersex users who are experts in their chosen field in order to ensure strict quality control and have one or two of each mod the sub respectively, and I need the mods to have the expertise to be able to comb through everything we have collected and flag the dodgy or outdated material to ensure strict quality control. 

You don't need to be an expert or student of such STEM fields; people who are learned in psychology, sociology, psychiatry and counselling as well as political activism are also needed. Sexual health experts are also wanted. If you think you know your stuff about anything like this please don't hesitate to apply. Students are welcome, you don't need to be fully qualified. 

I simply do not have the expertise or the qualifications to ensure quality control myself, and I know there are a few users here who know their stuff about such things. Without expert users to ensure quality material my sub simply won't work. 


If you would like to mod this sub and feel you have the expertise to do it well, please PM me or email with a few paragraphs about yourself and I will contact you once the sub is up and running. 


I want everything. Give me everything. Don't worry if you're not sure if it's trust worthy or legitimate because we can sort that out later. Just give me everything! 

You can share them here or if you can email them to me at LGBTeducationproject@outlook.com 


Once the sub is up and running and the mods chosen, the mods will then comb through the material and remove anything that isn't sufficiently valid. 

Once mods have cross referenced and the material archived into the relevant category, the sub will then be open to the public to read and share. 



Once the basic foundation has been laid, the sub will then be dedicated to hosting new studies or sources as they are released. I want it to be *the* go to place to find the latest developments in study of all LGBTQI phenomena. 


My vision is of a digital library of quality, informative and interesting material people can browse through for hours on end. My vision is a one stop shop for a quality education on LGBTQI phenomena which will undermine oppressive regimes all around the world. My vision is whenever someone comes out, the first thing people think of is ""you have to check out this sub!"". 

I also intend to spend money on stickers to advertise the project all around the world and send them at no cost to anyone who wants to spread the word, especially in oppressive countries. 


My vision is a sub which catapults education and understanding of all LGBTQI phenomena and will last, hosting new studies and sources as they are released. Please help me make my vision a reality. I can't do it without your help! 


There will also be a section for asylum seekers and kids sent to conversion camps or conversion therapy, shelter contact details for kids who have been kicked out and other things like that. Like I said everyone is a share holder and this is a community project and everyone's input and ideas is welcome and needed! 


Please suggest names for the sub also! Any other suggestions for how the sub will work and what it could feature are also very welcome. I believe people want to learn about LGBT but don't have an easy and convenient way to access that information; I hope my sub is the bridge that provides that access. 

Please note I will also cross post this to other LGBTQI subs. 

email: LGBTeducationproject@outlook.com   

You have the rest of February to submit material here or via email and apply for modship before we begin. If you would like to get involved in any way, please do as all are welcome and the more the merrier!

There are lots of little details but the basic plot is that they both love each other but the military recruit is focused so hard on presenting a hyper masculine front that he refuses to acknowledge his feelings. It all comes to a head when he tries to impress a bunch of bullies who enjoy harassing prostitutes by telling them he can get one to give it up for free. He goes to his friend and manipulates him into have sex with him by telling him he loves him. A lot more stuff happens but the story focuses on the guilt and betrayal felt by the two boys.

He left on vacation a few days back and is coming back Saturday night. I know he's a fan of cookies and red licorice so would it be out-of-line to leave those on his doorstep with a belated-birthday note for when he gets home? Or is it too early to be doing something like that?

I'm really sorry for asking basically the same thing again, I just need to take this off my chest because I have no one else to talk about this.

I knew beforehand at what time he was leaving today, so I pretended to be working near the exit door just to say goodbye to him. The moment I've been waiting for came and in a matter of seconds he was like ""Goodbye, take care!"" then I asked ""are you leaving?"" which he replied ""Yes"" and kept on walking. I know I shouldn't have asked a ""yes/no"" question but I thought my plan was going to work since I talked to him earlier and he knew I was going to be around, so why don't stop and talk a little? 

I'm so incredibly frustrated right now, I waited since last saturday for today and my plan didn't work out, I thought he'd stop and talk but I have a feeling he's a little shy. I don't want to annoy him by asking questions all the time I have to go to his area, but at the same time I want him to notice me, to know that I'm there and that I want to know him. When we talked last time (It wasn't that much, maybe less than 2 minutes because I can't stay away from my area for much time) he asked a few question, so, I feel like he's interested in knowing me (even if it's as a friend...)

It's been a while since I felt like this, since I felt nervous just for having someone I like near, since I felt like I can't take someone out of my head and I'm really serious about wanting to know him, even if he's not gay in the end, I just want to take the risk.



On a side note: Are there any songs dealing with this kind of stuff? like wanting to know someone or having a crush with someone and not knowing what to do?    ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, as a few of you know, I have a crush with one of my coworkers. I&amp;#39;m really sorry for asking basically the same thing again, I just need to take this off my chest because I have no one else to talk about this. I&amp;#39;m not out yet but I&amp;#39;m willing to come out for this guy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew beforehand at what time he was leaving today, so I pretended to be working near the exit door just to say goodbye to him. The moment I&amp;#39;ve been waiting for came and in a matter of seconds he was like &amp;quot;Goodbye, take care!&amp;quot; then I asked &amp;quot;are you leaving?&amp;quot; which he replied &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; and kept on walking. I know I shouldn&amp;#39;t have asked a &amp;quot;yes/no&amp;quot; question but I thought my plan was going to work since I talked to him earlier and he knew I was going to be around, so why don&amp;#39;t stop and talk a little? &lt;/p&gt;

They do enjoy sex but rather stick to oral and masturbation, even if mutual.

I've always thought I was just afraid of it and that someday I'd find someone I'd be comfortable with to engage in penetrative sex, but now I don't feel so lonely on this. I used to think I was the weird one and that I was pretty much alone feeling like this (I know, stupid now in hindsight) but it was very liberating to read about it somewhere on the internet and see it on the teli, knowing that perhaps I do fit in somewhere and that it is somewhat a normal occurrence.

I've also read there is a lot of prejudice towards gay men that behave like this, I hope you guys won't be too judgemental. 

Anyway, please share your experiences, what you think about this and so on. It might be good for other people to see that they are not weird to behave like this and I am certainly curious to hear about you guys, whether you are a "" side"" too or if you're a top/bottom/versatile.

Thanks.
