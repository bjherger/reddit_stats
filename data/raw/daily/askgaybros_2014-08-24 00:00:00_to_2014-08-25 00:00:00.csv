It really threw me for a loop and made me want to reassess what I want, what I was doing, etc.

So I took a year off and was celibate. I also moved to make more money.

Now I truly feel like my body wants and needs sex, but I can't shake my hesitation away even for a bit. I used the apps again and even went on a few platonic dates with guys from OK Cupid, but I still couldn't find anyone I was actually attracted or interested in both mentally and physically.

I'll be moving back to my original city where my friends are so maybe I'll be in a better mood; but as of today, it's just one of those nights where I just want guiltless NSA sex.

But I can barely get out a ""hey"" or ""sup"" on grindr.

Not sure if it's because using those avenues brought me someone who was very attractive and great in bed, but consistently had drama because of his drug use.

I'm not sure why I have hesitation. I just turned 26 and I feel like I should be fucking guys blindly, but I can't even look at an attractive man in the face and say hello.

I would be honest and say that I don't really even talk to guys in public because I don't feel comfortable being out in this city. Most of my friends in my older city are gay and I miss that, I miss having some wingmen and a life. I'll be patient and hold on, but I was just wondering

He was so cute and funny that we've kept dating, and we might even be boyfriends.  (I'm hesitant to have the ""let's stay exclusive"" talk with him until I figure out if I'm interested in the long term, but I'd still feel like I was cheating if I hooked up with anyone else.)

I'm a pretty average guy, and I was never in a frat.  He was the president of his though, and even though he's out of undergrad, I feel like he still talks about it *all the time*.  Many of his stories are about drunken shenanigans and the things they had to do during hazing and stuff.  I haven't met many of his friends yet, but apparently he always hangs out with his frat bros from school now.

He's great most of the time, but I hate when he slips into frat mode.  Frat mode usually comes out when he drinks.  To me, it comes off as immature.  He'll start wanting to do shots the more he drinks.  Everything is always ""let's pregame!"" or ""We should chug a beer before we leave.""  Like, why would I want to chug a beer?  The time I was most mortified was when we were at a bar and apparently there was a beer funnel and he yells, ""DUDE we should do the BEER FUNNEL!"" and next thing you know, he's helping these random female undergrads funnel beer with the bartender.  I'm all for fun, but funneling Bud Light at a dive bar is too much for me.

He also has a bunch of fratty things.  He dresses like he's straight out of a J. Crew catalog, he only wears Sperry's, half the time he's wearing a backwards hat, everything is ""America!"", etc.  He even has a goddamn picture of Ronald Reagan on his wall.  Now, I'm absolutely not petty enough that I care what he wears, but it bothers me that he could be *so handsome* if he just dressed more nicely.  

Finally, I feel like he sees everything through a ""frat lens.""  One of my friends met us for ""drinks"" (she doesn't drink, so she sticks to Seltzer water), and he made the comment, ""She seems so nice, it's a shame she doesn't just drink like a normal person.""  Then when I said that she doesn't drink because alcoholism runs in her family and maybe his drinking habits were what wasn't normal, he took it as a huge compliment that he drank more than the normal person.  I'm not sure if this is related to being in a frat or not, but he also doesn't seem to respect anything to do with art or creativity or scholarly efforts.  My sister spoke at a panel recently, and I explained to him she was talking about issues related to privilege, race, gender, etc. (She's a professor.)  He didn't know what privilege was, and when I explained what it was, he said ""That's so awesome that I'm, like, the most privileged!""  Like the concept completely evaded him - he just thought it was ""cool"" to be privileged.  Seriously? 

He's 24, so he's still young.  Does this ""phase"" generally go away, or will he be a ""frat star"" forever?  He seems really down to trying new experiences, but it's getting old.  I have tons of fun with him, but I keep finding new ""frat things"" about him.  We had lunch today, and he started singing along to Wagon Wheel.  It's not a big deal, but it's like with each passing day, I notice another thing.

I'm also 24.  Should I just stop seeing him?  I feel bad doing so over something so irrelevant.  I know there's never going to be the ""perfect"" guy for me, and he is really nice and sweet, so I just don't want to throw away a decent and attractive guy over such petty details.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I met a really hot guy on Grindr, and I tried to initiate a hook up, but he told me we&amp;#39;d have to meet for drinks first.  He was so cute and funny that we&amp;#39;ve kept dating, and we might even be boyfriends.  (I&amp;#39;m hesitant to have the &amp;quot;let&amp;#39;s stay exclusive&amp;quot; talk with him until I figure out if I&amp;#39;m interested in the long term, but I&amp;#39;d still feel like I was cheating if I hooked up with anyone else.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a pretty average guy, and I was never in a frat.  He was the president of his though, and even though he&amp;#39;s out of undergrad, I feel like he still talks about it &lt;em&gt;all the time&lt;/em&gt;.  Many of his stories are about drunken shenanigans and the things they had to do during hazing and stuff.  I haven&amp;#39;t met many of his friends yet, but apparently he always hangs out with his frat bros from school now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s great most of the time, but I hate when he slips into frat mode.  Frat mode usually comes out when he drinks.  To me, it comes off as immature.  He&amp;#39;ll start wanting to do shots the more he drinks.  Everything is always &amp;quot;let&amp;#39;s pregame!&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;We should chug a beer before we leave.&amp;quot;  Like, why would I want to chug a beer?

Just need to get this off my chest and talk about it.

Wall of text warning, I guess.

Okay, so this is essentially what happened. Myself, my partner and three of our good friends went for a night on the town to celebrate my partners good exam results. I could see at a very early stage of the night that he was going to be extremely drunk, and I thought, well so what, I'll stay sensible and look after him, he is celebrating after all. So the night goes on and he gets kind of rough with his horseplay in the club, to the point where one of our friends politely excuses himself and says he's off early to get food.

Shortly after, me and a friend of mine were talking in the smoking area when my boyfriend stumbled out, and knocked into a guy who was standing close to us. The man he bumped into politely asked if he could be more careful, and that's when I saw the warning signs because my boyfriend went all quiet and had this angry look on his face then started shouting and pushing the man.

Cue me and my friend to swoop in and trail him off the guy and out into the main club to calm him down. I'm a lot bigger than my SO (I'm 6""4, hes 5""8), but he was going crazy and giving even myself and my friend trouble removing him from the smoking area. As we were trying to move him away he threw a few punches to my face, so I thought ""Fuck this."" and tried to leave the club to get our friend who'd left to buy food, to see if he could talk some sense into him. As I was leaving my boyfriend shouted a few threats at me that if I told our friend (we'll call him Paul) I'd be in trouble etc. I shrugged it off and went to get Paul.

A few minutes later, I'm outside talking to Paul, and looking pretty visibly upset I guess, and my boyfriend walks over with a big smile on his face asking me whats wrong. So I told him I didn't feel like speaking to him now, I was upset and would speak to him when we were both sober, and he wouldn't take that for an answer. So I told him the entire story and his answer was, ""Oh, sorry, I guess"". This is where I started to get angry, he thought that was the matter closed and sorted and we'd be dandy.

I walked away, jumped in a cab and went him and I ignored phone calls from him while I was there and eventually my phone died. When I got home I charged it and I received about 10 messages saying that I was blowing this out of proportion and I was going to use it as an excuse to leave him so I could sleep with other guys? 

So at this point, I just went to sleep. I've woken up this morning with a clearer head and though ""Hey, maybe it was an accident and he was just swinging his arms when we carted him off"", trying to rationalize it, but my friend who was helping me remove him from the fight assured me that it looked like it was on purpose.

He's texting me this morning like nothings wrong, so either he thinks we really did sort it out last night or he doesn't remember. 

We've been together a year and a half, and this is the first time anything like this has happened, maybe it was a one off thing, or maybe this is a red flag for the future. It has definitely been one of the happiest years of my life, so I don't want to just break it off without thinking about it first. I'm not really sure bros. Anyone have any advice for dealing with this?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throwaway here.&lt;/p&gt;
