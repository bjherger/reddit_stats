I'm 18 and have been raised in a religious family most of my life but in the last two years have become an atheist (this will be important in a bit). In the past 6-8 months I've been sort of realizing that I have interest in men. But because of me being raised to think homosexuality is wrong I feel like it's getting in the way. It feels like something is telling me it's all wrong when I want to enjoy something. There is a guy I'm talking with who is really great and we have a lot of the same interests but I'm unable to enjoy myself, even though I really want to enjoy everything about him. We are taking things slowly and have agreed that I would take the next step when comfortable with everything.  
So my questions are...

1)  has this sort of thing happened to any of you?

2) should I be worried?

3) how should I move on from here?

Relatively new to Grindr or any of these GPS/hookup apps.

I somewhat recently got out of a relationship and am tired of the idea of serious dating for the time being. Part of me wants to have more fleeting connections for a while and enjoy just having fun.

But I've run into a problem. I'm getting a good amount of attention on apps like Grindr, but I'm afraid to pull the trigger. I'm not sure why. I think the idea of objectifying someone/being objectified without much else feels intimidating. It feels, I don't know, less safe than a relationship. Which is ironic because my last relationship was anything but. 

Are there reasons to put up boundaries when you go on Grindr hookups? Or should I just go all out? How do I know what's the ""right"" way to go about exploring all of this?

Thanks in advance!

I'm definitely straight-acting 100% and not out to any family or friends as bi.  I live with a number of roommates in a house, whom I had only fist met before moving in with them about two weeks beforehand, so I'm obviously not out to any of them either and I plan on keeping it that way. 

Here's the story. 
We threw a party and a number of my roommates friends from their hometown were here visiting. One guy from out of town came over, it was my first time meeting him and he turned 21 that day. We hung out for a good part of the night, and were both pretty drunk. He was also on a dose of acid and I had taken some molly. Once the party started dying down, we were trying to play Golden Tee (yes, the old school golf game you see in bars, we have one in our house) but couldn't figure out how to turn it on, so I asked if he wanted to play GTA5 instead. We went in my room and played for a while, I can't remember quite how long. While we were chilling, smoking, and playing I was getting some very indirect gay vibes from him, even though as far as I knew, he was straight. He also didn't seem interested in the party or whatever else was going on outside my room. I even went out a couple of times to check things out and he stayed. After we kept playing awhile, my drunk horniness was definitely on full blast, and I started getting kinda touchy with him. (Nothing too crazy, he was in a chair and I was sitting on the floor, so I would lean my head over and rest on his leg/the chair for a min, I might have rested my hand on him for a split second longer than usual when grabbing the control or ipad) After awhile I couldn't hear anyone else talking outside my room, and I asked if he wanted to go to sleep. I wasn't entirely sure if he was planning on crashing at my house even (he was staying the weekend somewhere else) but I offered that he could stay in my room, and even though I didn't have an extra pillow, he stayed. So I turned the lights out, and it wasn't more than 10 minutes that they were out and I decided to move in a little closer to him. I was on my stomach and he was laying on his back. My hand brushed up against his thigh and I left it there.  After a little while, he moved his leg closer to me so that more of my arm was touching it. After a little longer one of us moved even closer cause I could tell my hand was even closer to him, and kind of under his leg, like close to his gooch I guess. I don't think he was asleep because his breathing wasn't rhythmic and it actually sounded like he laughed a few times. So then I just went for it and started feeling his crotch through his jeans, I could tell he was hard. I started putting my mouth on his cock, sucking through the jeans, and then started to undo his belt. He hadn't said a word at all. I undid his jeans, unzipped his pants, put my hand in and grabbed his cock out. It was pitch black and his pants were still almost completely on, so I couldn't see his face, his cock or anything. I started sucking for what couldn't be more than 20 seconds, and then my stupid self started getting a little more touchy. I put my hand up his shirt and started feeling on his abs as I made out with his dick. It was at this point that he said, ""relax dude,"" the first words he said since I turned the lights out. He didn't sound groggy like he had just woke up at that moment or anything, and since we had just went to ""sleep"" I have to assume that me unbuckling his pants and pulling his dick out would have woken him up. When he said ""relax"" i had no clue if he was referring to my hand going up his shirt or to the whole situation in general, so I asked (with my mouth still right next to his cock), ""should I keep going"" or something like that. I honestly can't remember if he replied or not, but I don't think he did because I'm pretty sure I asked twice. With that I rolled over, didn't even put his cock back in his pants or anything, and went back to sleep. He stayed the rest of the night in my room when he could have easily went in my roommates room (his friend from home) or the living room which was unoccupied. He left in the morning without saying anything (I know it was morning because I woke up when he left.) 

Half of me is disappointed and kinda pissed because if I would have kept going it could have potentially been really hot. Part of me thinks it was probably the right thing to stop at that moment considering he had never explicitly told me he wanted it and we were both pretty fucked up. What's your opinions about this? What would you have done if you were me? 

Also, I'm kind of thinking I want to add him on Facebook. He goes to a college about 2 hours away from me, and I think the only time I might see or talk to him again would be if he comes down for another weekend to visit my roommate. The catch is, as I said before, I can't have anyone, especially my roommates know that this happened. Even though I barely know him I can't really see him telling anyone, especially my roommate. I don't really want anything to come out of me adding him on Facebook, and I definitely don't think I would initiate a conversation, but I don't know. If he comes down again it could be either really fucking awkward, really normal (if he doesn't remember?), or really hot if we somehow potentially hooked up again. I think that depends on if I add him on Facebook and what happens if I do. What do you guys think? Is it worth any potential sexual encounter with him? What should I say about it to him, if anything?

**tl;dr met a guy at my party, thought I was getting gay signals, went to bed, ended up moving in closer to him and eventually sucking him off until he told me to ""relax"" and then stopped because I wasn't sure what he meant or if he wanted me to keep going.**","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m 22 and a senior in college. I&amp;#39;m definitely straight-acting 100% and not out to any family or friends as bi.  I live with a number of roommates in a house, whom I had only fist met before moving in with them about two weeks beforehand, so I&amp;#39;m obviously not out to any of them either and I plan on keeping it that way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the story. 
We threw a party and a number of my roommates friends from their hometown were here visiting. One guy from out of town came over, it was my first time meeting him and he turned 21 that day. We hung out for a good part of the night, and were both pretty drunk. He was also on a dose of acid and I had taken some molly. Once the party started dying down, we were trying to play Golden Tee (yes, the old school golf game you see in bars, we have one in our house) but couldn&amp;#39;t figure out how to turn it on, so I asked if he wanted to play GTA5 instead. We went in my room and played for a while, I can&amp;#39;t remember quite how long. While we were chilling, smoking, and playing I was getting some very indirect gay vibes from him, even though as far as I knew, he was straight. He also didn&amp;#39;t seem interested in the party or whatever else was going on outside my room. I even went out a couple of times to check things out and he stayed. After we kept playing awhile, my drunk horniness was definitely on full blast, and I started getting kinda touchy with him. (Nothing too crazy, he was in a chair and I was sitting on the floor, so I would lean my head over and rest on his leg/the chair for a min, I might have rested my hand on him for a split second longer than usual when grabbing the control or ipad) After awhile I couldn&amp;#39;t hear anyone else talking outside my room, and I asked if he wanted to go to sleep. I wasn&amp;#39;t entirely sure if he was planning on crashing at my house even (he was staying the weekend somewhere else) but I offered that he could stay in my room, and even though I didn&amp;#39;t have an extra pillow, he stayed. So I turned the lights out, and it wasn&amp;#39;t more than 10 minutes that they were out and I decided to move in a little closer to him. I was on my stomach and he was laying on his back. My hand brushed up against his thigh and I left it there.  After a little while, he moved his leg closer to me so that more of my arm was touching it. After a little longer one of us moved even closer cause I could tell my hand was even closer to him, and kind of under his leg, like close to his gooch I guess. I don&amp;#39;t think he was asleep because his breathing wasn&amp;#39;t rhythmic and it actually sounded like he laughed a few times. So then I just went for it and started feeling his crotch through his jeans, I could tell he was hard. I started putting my mouth on his cock, sucking through the jeans, and then started to undo his belt. He hadn&amp;#39;t said a word at all. I undid his jeans, unzipped his pants, put my hand in and grabbed his cock out. It was pitch black and his pants were still almost completely on, so I couldn&amp;#39;t see his face, his cock or anything. I started sucking for what couldn&amp;#39;t be more than 20 seconds, and then my stupid self started getting a little more touchy. I put my hand up his shirt and started feeling on his abs as I made out with his dick. It was at this point that he said, &amp;quot;relax dude,&amp;quot; the first words he said since I turned the lights out. He didn&amp;#39;t sound groggy like he had just woke up at that moment or anything, and since we had just went to &amp;quot;sleep&amp;quot; I have to assume that me unbuckling his pants and pulling his dick out would have woken him up. When he said &amp;quot;relax&amp;quot; i had no clue if he was referring to my hand going up his shirt or to the whole situation in general, so I asked (with my mouth still right next to his cock), &amp;quot;should I keep going&amp;quot; or something like that.

I apologize in advance as this is going to be a wall of text and I don't even know where to start. 

So I'm 23, and I have a friend who is the same age that I've known since about 3rd grade (about 8 or 9ish years old.)  So we're obviously pretty close.  Lives very close in my hometown and our parents know each other because we were such good friends back in the day.  After high school, we went to separate colleges, but we see each other on breaks and when we are both visiting our hometown. We still talk occasionally.  All of this being said, while we got along, we were always very different from each other. We hung out with different groups of friends for the most part. You get the picture.

For example, I'm a liberal atheist and he's a very conservative Christian. His family is very Christian and very conservative. He is so Christian, he possibly wants to be some sort of minister, even went to a Christian college for it. Nothing wrong with this, just giving you some slight background information. 

So around the time we were 14 or 15, we started messing around with each other. It started off just watching porn together, then slowly progressed to at about 20 (once we didn't see each other as much since we were off to college) we were having anal sex. Even today, the few times we still see each other, we usually still end up having sex. 

I have no emotional connection to him. So I'm not in love or infatuated by any means.  It's just a friend thing I guess. In college, I've recently discovered myself and accept that I'm now gay. And it's been kind of hard to see this friend solely because I think we just see each other these days, not for company, but just to end up having sex... We never make out or anything, it's never passionate, just basic sex.

I wouldn't normally be upset about that, but my friend acts very awkward about it.  I have not told him I'm gay yet.  Yes, we are fucking and I feel I can't tell him I'm gay.  It's very awkward because he still says things like ""Has Bob (a mutual friend from high school) come out of the closet yet? haha"" and ""My future wife is gonna love that I can sometimes go two times in a row"" and stuff like that. Like it doesn't even trigger in his mind that what we're doing (and have been doing for a long time) is very gay. I'm the only person he has ever had sex with as far as I know. He has had 1 girlfriend his whole life, only lasted about 1 month in high school.  When we do hang out and go to the bar or out to eat, I never see him look at attractive women or anything.

Am I just being weird about all this and thinking too deep into it? Or perhaps he actually is gay and is repressing his thoughts? 

Any advice or similar experiences would be great. Thanks in advance for all the advice bros! This is one of the best subreddits ever.

I wasn&amp;#39;t really sure what i&amp;#39;d get of it but i wanted to be in some sort of contact with any gay guys around me since i know none. 
Well I got some messages... mostly from older guys (24-28), some very attractive, and they seem interested in one thing only... In one hand I feel I&amp;#39;m more than ready and anxious to finally be with a man and I feel i won&amp;#39;t ever get the opportunity to do so if not like this. On the other I&amp;#39;m not exactly comfortable with the idea of being so intimate with a stranger; I&amp;#39;m a romantic guy and I&amp;#39;d like for it to be a loving experience.
So, should I wait for someone who probably won&amp;#39;t come for years, if ever, or should i go for a hook up hottie?&lt;/p&gt;

I'm in the following situation:
Met an guy on an app, chatted for about 3 months, just really nice genuine chatting. (No meet up  because we live in different countries.)
After these three months of chatting we met up (I happened to be in his city for different reasons), just for a drink but I think we both  felt something , so we met up again that weekend. It felt very good just to spend time together. 

After that we started to text daily, decided to go on holiday together eventually.

We booked a weekend trip together. I had really no expectations before that, he was just a nice person that I wanted to spend some more time with.

On that weekend it was the first time we got closer, as in kissing and cuddling. I loved that we took it slow and it all seemed like a mutual good process.

A month after that I went to his place for about 4,5 days which were so lovely and it really felt like this was something serious for both of us.

That's a bit of background story that isn't that relevant - **here's the important part**

Because I felt like we we're getting serious I asked him if he would still go on these apps, just out of interest. He told me he only went on the one app to read through our old messages. ok good. No big deal.

Anyways, I feel like i kind of ""checked"" on him, because I wanted to make sure what we had was something monogamous and because we hadn't really talked about that stuff I did feel a bit insecure.  So what I did there maybe wasn't too good. Wanting to know what he was up to.

Our next meeting he was visiting me, we had a long talk about our relationship (which it was at this point) so he assured me he's not seeing any other people, and doesn't go on apps anymore (even he still had them on his phone) Ok, I want to believe him, if he says so. I just want him to be honest, he says he is blah blah.

The weekend after that I go on the app to cancel my account details and see he was on my profile a few days ago, I check his profile and see he was logged in this morning. Big shock for me, when I confront him he says it's just for reading old messages. But the app deletes it after 20 day, I know that.  Then he said he was on there because he got a message and just wanted to read it. Ok I want to believe him whatever.

Because I saw another app on his phone, and I now have a feeling in my gut I go check that other app. And oh wonder guess who was logged in this morning.

Ok, he's on an app. What's important to me is honesty about that stuff. So I text him and ask him if he went on any other apps recently which he denies. SO much hurt, why would he lie... I just don't get why.

At the end, because I told him I saw him on another app, he admitted still being on that one for chatting to two people he's gotten used to chatting to. He told me he deleted the apps now.

Now he's kind of blaming me for having insecurity issues and I' just so hurt, not because of the chatting to other people (might be true that he did not wanted to tell me because of my reaction) but just the constant lying about that for months is so hurtful to me.

I liked what we had so much, couldn't really believe he would do something like that.

I don't know if I should give this another chance or not? Problem is I have a flight booked for his birthday in a few weeks.

I think now from writing all this down I kind of know that there is no point in continuing this is there?! I'm so sad and feel so numb.

Anyways. Thanks so much if you actually read this. I know I'm surely not the first one to experience that but I just don't know what to feel, what to think, what to do.
