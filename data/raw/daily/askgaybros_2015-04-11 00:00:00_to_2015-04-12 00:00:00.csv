I have a great time with him, and I really like him. Yesterday, though, we got into an argument and I somewhat ended things. He says that I'm the first person in a while he feels this kind of connection with, and I kind of feel the same.

He's a bit too overwhelming sometimes, I feel. He has an issue with gay bars and feels like I should tell him if I'm going to one with friends. He also says that, in a long-term relationship, he'd have a problem with his boyfriend going to gay bars. He feels that people go there only to have sex. I explained that my friends go to hangout, and I'll join them on occasion. I also belong to a gay organization, and he feels like he comes second to that, even though we've spent almost every weekend together.

I get what he's saying, but I feel like it's coming too fast. We're only a month in. Granted, he did not tell me that I could not go, just that he'd like me to tell him, since he's been cheated on in the past. He says that I value going to gay bars (which I don't go to very often) more than him. He says that, in relationships, people make concessions to each other and have to give up certain things, which I honestly didn't know how to take: follow my rules or just I'd eventually hope to come first in your life (fine with the latter, not the former). I honestly don't care about gay bars, but I don't want to feel like I have to live by rules and expectations, or that it will become an issue that I can't see my friends.

He can be a bit abrasive, it seems, too. When he's angry, he's the kind who will just shut down and say ""fine"" or throw things back at me.

Are these red flags? Should I just say okay, I'll tell you if I go out? Or can I expect things to only go down hill? Are these the signs of a possessive, controlling relationship? Or did I fuck up what could have been a good thing? Perhaps he's correct in what he's saying, but just communicates it very assuredly and emphatically?

Maybe he just knows what he wants and expects, and is just communicating it right from the get go. I just don't want to find myself six months down the road realizing I've made a mistake by ignoring red flags.

I like him, but I'm just afraid that because I like, I'm not seeing certain red flags early on. I'm not that experienced at relationships, so I don't know what to look for.

EDIT: What I'm not sure of is that he did make it clear early on where he is and how he feels. He hasn't told me to not go. He's come with me to some of the gay events, and he's had fun. My going tomorrow wasn't an issue. The issue this weekend came because I wanted to go to two events back to back and he just wanted to spend time alone. Concerning the gay bar, he's expressed from the beginning that he's had issues in the past, and he just wants to know to ease his mind.

Now, I know that no porn studio should be held responsible for individual choices, especially in light of the fact that (theoretically) the people consuming porn are all adults. Plus, the purpose of porn is to jack off -- not to learn responsible social behavior. 

However, I do think that many guys derive some of their turn-ons from porn and that if they weren't always watching bareback sex, it wouldn't have as much of an allure.

Would gay guys be better off if bareback films didn't exist or if bareback scenes were at least depicted responsibly? I think so.

Been dating this guy I know from school for about a month now. He was the one who admitted his feelings for me, and I had previously expressed interest in him, so naturally, we decided to spend some time together. I graduated in December, but he's still got one more year of school left. We get along great, and our relationship is what i would describe as intimate. The only hangup i have about him is his lack of communication. I'm a big texting person, and sometimes when i send him messages, it's for the sake of initiating conversation. He almost never responds, and when he does, it's never with too much detail. He and I set up dates through text, but beyond that, there's almost no communication between us in between dates. He doesn't try to engage me in conversation, and sometimes it's kind of worrying on my part because it makes me wonder if the relationship is going well. 

This is my first time in a relationship, so naturally, I don't have a good idea how to get to know him in his off hours. He's a student, constantly studying and involved in so many university clubs that it makes my head spin. Most of the time, calling him is not an option. 

I guess what my question is would you say this is a problem, or am I getting too hung up on texting being an effective form of communication? I don't know how to feel about it. On the one hand he and I are very intimate when we are together, but I can't help but feel coldness when we're away. I don't know if I'm engaging him enough or if I should give him his space. Any suggestions/help is greatly appreciated.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey Bros,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess what my question is would you say this is a problem, or am I getting too hung up on texting being an effective form of communication? I don&amp;#39;t know how to feel about it. On the one hand he and I are very intimate when we are together, but I can&amp;#39;t help but feel coldness when we&amp;#39;re away. I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;m engaging him enough or if I should give him his space. Any suggestions/help is greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

Thanks for all your help last time. Thought I would ask you for further help. To get the back story on me and Kevin, please see the original post here: http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/2t0w03/in_love_with_my_frat_bro_should_i_tell_him/

So I decided not to tell Kevin, my younger newly out frat bro, that I have really strong feelings for him. The reason for this is mostly because I am 6 years older and feel he sees me as a mentor and nothing more. 

The new problem arouse because as we were talking and i came up with the idea for Kevin to be completely out on a trip he was taking to florida. (We live in NM and he doesn't really know any one there to worry about ""outing"" himself too.) so he downloaded Grindr, tinder and talked with a bunch of guys. One the the guys he met there, Chris, really clicked with Kevin. The stories he shared made it sound like they had a great week together while Kevin was visiting. 

Now back home in New Mexico, Kevin and I are still close as ever. The difference is now him and Chris are starting a long distance relationship. It's progressed really quick in my opinion. (They spend a little less than a week together and now talk by phone for 3 weeks and are already saying the L-word) But I'm not one to judge. I am one to be jealous though. Kevin tells me all the time about the sweet things that him and Chris share. How they are planning trips to see each other and trying to make living 3000 miles apart work. In really happy for him. But I'm so jealous.

 I've kept it all quite and just tell him how happy I am that he found someone special because he is an amazing guy that deserves the best. The incredibly tough part is that Kevin keeps thanking me. I was the one to pressure him and told him to just be open about who he is while away in Florida. He keeps telling me that I am the reason he met Chris. That I am the reason he is happy, the happiest he has ever been. I tell him he doesn't have to thank me, I'm sure he thinks I'm being modest but in actuality it breaks my heart every time I hear that I he is so happy because of me while not being with me.  

I know this sounds petty, mostly I'm just venting. But do you Bros think I should just keep doing what I'm doing: be happy for him while hiding my sadness? Should I try to avoid him and put distance between us to try and avoid hurting myself more? I could always be blunt and say that I'm happy for him but don't want to hear about it. But then I feel like I'm robbing him of what I should be doing as a friend if that's what I truly want to be to him. Thanks for listening and any advice you have to share.

Is it stupid if to be sort of a prerequisite in who you date? I'm curious. 

I'm one of those guys who considers intelligence, wit and personality the most important parts in judging a guy as a perspective boyf. His taste in things like movies, music and TV are a good proxy to judge those things on, and I kind of consider having some overlap pretty important to the future of a relationship. 

I can and have had fun dating streaks with all sorts of boys as long as they're exciting, but eventually I start to think ""Going out with him and kissing is fun ...but what are we going to do when it gets to the point when we're hanging out at my place on a tuesday night trying to find something to agree on on Netflix?"" Sometimes a guy will make me watch a painfully stupid comedy movie, and he'll laugh hysterically at it, and it kind of turns me off. I turned down a date with a fitness model because he wanted to see a Transformers movies. Other times when I pick the movie or event we're going to I can sense that they're so board and not getting it and it makes me feel bad. 

I should add that my taste is pretty wide ranging, and it's not that I don't like low brow stuff either. I just think that if my taste and a potential boys' taste were a venn diagram there should be a nice but obviously not total overlap. In practice I'm sort of like, ""Ok, he got my 30 Rock reference, and an LCD Soundsystem song came on his iPod in the car ...I think I can work with this."" 

I have friends who disagree that this is important. I asked one if a boy liking the music he likes is important. He said, ""No, that's why they invented headphones. His values and credit score are much more important to me than what he watches on tv."" 

But I don't know. LTRs are a big deal. I want someone who watches my favorite shows with me and introduces me to new ones I might like. I don't want to argue over who gets to control the radio in the car. I want to go on Sunday night dates to the art house cinema and talk about it afterwards. And honestly I wonder how much a guy who doesn't like the same things as me would get along with my friends. 

It's just hard to find for me. I know those guys are out there, but I have a hard time finding one that also wants to date me it seems. Maybe it's my city. Maybe its just me, but lots of other types of boys seem to like me. 

Maybe it's shallow, but I don't know. SO many boys are like ""I only date boys with beards,"" or ""I want a daddy"" or this or that. Honestly I'd be open to a 50-year-old black bear daddy bottom or a hairless Hawaiian twink if he liked a lot of the same things as I do. But am I going about it all wrong?

In practice I&amp;#39;m sort of like, &amp;quot;Ok, he got my 30 Rock reference, and an LCD Soundsystem song came on his iPod in the car ...I think I can work with this.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have friends who disagree that this is important. I asked one if a boy liking the music he likes is important. He said, &amp;quot;No, that&amp;#39;s why they invented headphones. His values and credit score are much more important to me than what he watches on tv.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I don&amp;#39;t know. LTRs are a big deal. I want someone who watches my favorite shows with me and introduces me to new ones I might like. I don&amp;#39;t want to argue over who gets to control the radio in the car. I want to go on Sunday night dates to the art house cinema and talk about it afterwards. And honestly I wonder how much a guy who doesn&amp;#39;t like the same things as me would get along with my friends. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just hard to find for me. I know those guys are out there, but I have a hard time finding one that also wants to date me it seems. Maybe it&amp;#39;s my city. Maybe its just me, but lots of other types of boys seem to like me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&amp;#39;s shallow, but I don&amp;#39;t know. SO many boys are like &amp;quot;I only date boys with beards,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;I want a daddy&amp;quot; or this or that. Honestly I&amp;#39;d be open to a 50-year-old black bear daddy bottom or a hairless Hawaiian twink if he liked a lot of the same things as I do. But am I going about it all wrong? Cuz shit ain&amp;#39;t really working for me. &lt;/p&gt;

My issue tho, if he asks how I found out I feel embarrassed saying browsing through instagram. Also the guy who had the account they are super close and best friends.

Where to begin? Alright, so I'm 21 and living in the U.S. About 3 1/2 years ago I met my ex online and it was like a switch went off in my head. I fell extremely hard for him, and lucky for me he fell hard for me too. Fast forward 6 months later and he flies from the UK to the US for 2 weeks. It all happened so fast, but it was easily the best time of my life. He was my first everything, and was so understanding, patient, and overall just perfect. We connected on ways that he and I never experienced before in our lives. We were so perfect together that people often commented that it was fate that brought us together. Corny, but go figure...

Fast forward 3 months later, and after our separation, things began to crumble. I didn't have to time to keep up with conversation that often and I began drifting away from him. A month later (on easter) he ended up doing something that he knew would upset me (in retrospect it wasn't that bad) and I irrationally flipped out. I ended up calling him a bunch of bad names and broke up with him out of anger. A few days pass and I knew I had made a mistake. I asked to get back with him hundreds of times afterwards but apparently he just ""didn't feel the same"" (and I didn't blame him. I was kind of an ass). I ended up becoming extremely depressed and even ended up attempting suicide. When my parents found out, they encouraged me to seek help from a therapist and I was put on antidepressants of which I am still on. I'm stable now, so no need to worry.

After an initial year of crying, heartbreak, and total depression I was able to sort of ""move on"", and began becoming really social and made quite a lot of friends. Things seemed to have clicked in my head, and I accepted that things weren't meant to be.

Well, 2 years has passed since then and just the other day I was on Facebook and ended up seeing his profile on my ""suggested friends"" feed. One glance and I panicked. I froze, and in that moment everything kind of came rushing back to me. Now for the past week he's pretty much all I can think of and how much I fucked things up.

I feel like no matter how much I try, I compare everyone to him. I haven't had a single romantic experience since January 2012 and it's beginning to make me feel undesirable. The void in my life seems impossible to close, and on days like today I can't even leave my room. My parents try to get me to go out and ""live life"", but those things are so out of my comfort zone that I'm stuck in this vicious cycle of depression, hopelessness, loneliness, and regret.

How can I learn to get over him? The thought of him being with someone else absolutely tears me apart even though I cut contact 3 years ago. I feel like nothing will change in 5, 10, 20 years from now, and I'll still be in the same place, thinking about where he is, my regrets, and all the what-ifs.

I'm a single gay dude in the city. Lately, I've been seeing this one dude, let's call him Paul, for about 2 months. While we haven't made anything official, I do genuinely like him. Further, he's been the first guy I've liked since I broke up with my last ex.

About two hours ago, my ex of 4 years called out of the blue that he's returned to the city and wanted to grab dinner to catch up. Some background, Sean and I broke up because he returned to Ireland to help out his sick parents and take care of his younger brother. He asked me to come with him, but I don't said ""no"" because I don't like going to places where I don't have job security (the thought of depending on others makes me queasy).

I know that if I were to meet up with him, all those emotions I worked so hard to squash when he left will reemerge. Further, while I have no obligations to tell Paul about our dinner, I still feel like I'm cheating on him. 

Here's my question: do I move on and not see Sean, prevent those welled up emotions from bursting, and give Paul a chance. Or, should I risk going to dinner and not tell Paul, with the chance, no, probability that I'll end up relapsing and falling for Sean again?
