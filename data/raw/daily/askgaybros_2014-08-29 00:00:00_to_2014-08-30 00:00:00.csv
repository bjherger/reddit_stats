I've been thinking about making a post here for a while, but I wasn't entirely certain about the story I would tell or the question I would ask. Let me just preface my story with a few details. I'm going to be very honest, so sorry if it sounds offensive.


I'm 25, and I guess you could say I'm bi. I've sucked some dicks before but the last time was two years ago and I've slept with more women since (not loads, I'm no casanova, but it hasn't happened with any guys). I'm attracted to guys and watching gay porn arouses me, a lot, and I watch more than I do straight porn. That last guy I was with, we didn't fuck. It was some sucking and rimming. He was an amazing kisser, he smelt great, and I truly regret it went south and we didn't fuck. I enjoyed it immensely. Actually, of the other 5 guys before him over the course of three or so years, we never actually had full sex. I think partly I was scared to, and partly I was too wasted in the act so it simply didn't occur.


Now, here's the story, a brief one because I don't know how to form paragraphs on reddit...so here we go.
I was seeing a girl recently but wasn't that into her and felt the sex was ungenerous. I didn't like her enough and when she wanted to grow a bit more serious I flaked and it broke off. I was glad, and also a bit mad. The girl clearly had some problems; scars all over the arms, weird emotional flippancy. I felt mad because I thought shit, is some damaged goods girl the best I can manage to get? I'm not bad looking, really, but I don't do as well as I might, I guess because of some confidence issues or general weirdness that I'm trying so hard to rectify.
Anyway, after this I went to a gay meetup.com thing, and thought, hell, I'll go the other way and see if anything cuter bites my worm. It was a meal, and I met some pleasant guys there, but I wasn't attracted to any of them and would happily just have made friends. One guy liked me, I could tell, and we went for drinks a few times but I just wasn't attracted. He was a lovely guy and I wanted to just be his friend. Alas, he stopped texting me and started ignoring me, I guess after realising I wasn't into him. This disappointed me and made me feel irritated over gay people. Also at the aforementioned meal some of them were talking quite brazenly about multiple fucks and trash like that. And it repulsed me, the way they behaved. So shortly after these basic non events, I don't really feel like I want to be a part of that scene.


BUT I'm definitely very attracted to guys - though there are many who I know are straight who I want but could never have. Then there are other guys I find beautiful and would love to have a sexual experience with and a relationship, but maybe they're 'out of my league' even if they are gay. With a guy I would want the relationship aspect as well, I may add.


A few weeks after this dinner, I went to a gay bar. A guy invited me who was working at the bar; an absolutely gorgeous boy from Belarus. Stupidly, I thought he liked me so I gladly went. Sitting at the bar alone, I got hit on about 5 times. Now I haven't been in a gay bar for about 5 years at this point, and I didn't feel attracted to any of the guys who hit on me. It gave me that uncomfortable, grossed out feeling again. At quitting time, this guy got off, met his boyfriend and was gone. I was shocked and very disappointed. Then I did the requisite get-hammered and malign the fact that boys I want aren't available and probably too good for me. Truthfully, I felt stupid as fuck.


So, in the present moment I feel as if the gay thing is pointless to me because like I've said, I don't just want any guy. I generally can't sleep with just anyone, and especially if it was a guy. It'd have to be someone perfect. But I feel I'm too shitty looking to have those standards and it isn't impossible for me to fuck women and enjoy it.
As a final caveat; I was with another girl between this 10 week one and the gay bar. It was another 10 week thing (I guess I'm a failure) and initially I was up front and told her I was bi. BIG MISTAKE. The whole time she seemed to hold that against me and I'm quite certain that's why she eventually ditched me.
I now don't feel that I should tell the next woman who likes me; I love women, I love fucking them. But a part of me wants guys incredibly badly. Though why go through the hassle when I can be with women? Which I'm fine with too. Also I'm completely masculine, nobody would realise type, so am I just hassling myself by carrying around this bi label? I think I'm just going to go with women.
I'm keen to hear your opinions though, thanks if you read this.


TLDR: Disillusioned by gays and think the ones I truly want aren't available to someone like me.

I'm pretty stressed right now and need some advice. I know that this isn't ideal, but I've been with a married man for the past year and a half. He's a gay closeted person and we're able to provide each other with comfort. His wife and kids know that he's gay, but decide to 'look the other way' and ignore it. He's been a great person to me and has helped to see life in a more positive light. He has two sons that I'm friends with; one of which is the same age as me and I see him as a brother now because of how well we get along so well. I have a lot of respect for the entire family and have never wanted to harm the integrity of their family. 


His wife knows that he's gay. They don't really have a good relationship with each other and there's a lot of tension between the two because she doesn't like the fact that he's attracted to men. I also know that they don't have a good sex life because of what he's told me. She's always paranoid that he's having sex with numerous men and constantly accuses him of being with many of the males that he works with. I know his wife personally as we've worked together in the past, and from what he's told me, she knows that he's attracted to men of my size/stature/ethnicity/etc. She's accused him of being with me numerous times and he always denies it. Yesterday I texted him “Hey how are you doing?” and then I sent another text saying “I miss you a lot”. He responded back saying that his wife read the texts and once again accused him of being with me. The fact that she had access to him phone is uncommon and has never happened before, so I was definitely surprised to read his response and was only able to reply back with the question of if she outed me, which would be devastating to me seeing as this news would probably relay to many of my friends that I work with for one of my jobs. 


He told me that he denied it.  I only sent that text because I'm essentially alone and have no family living nearby, and that he's the closest thing that I have to a father/family. Afterwards, I was only able to respond with saying that he should try to keep his head up high and not get too stressed. This happened last night. Since this morning, I've been able to text him and he's acting like nothing happened. I know that I'm just supposed to act like it's no big deal, but for some reason I feel pretty stressed out about the entire situation. I don't really have anyone to talk to about this because I'm not out yet and I can't really come out of the closet because of the fact that it would make my boyfriend feel threatened, which is something that he feels adamant about me not doing because he doesn't want anyone to make the connection between my homosexuality and our friendship.

I've always battled with confusion about my sexuality and all that good stuff which I'm sure many of you fine gentlemen have also experienced. After years of internal sexual discord throughout my adolescence, I've finally come to terms with my orientation during the last year or so, and I've never felt more mentally at ease. That's right: confidence, excitement and basically all of that overwhelming relief that ensues once you fully come out to yourself. 

The only problem is my family does not know (that is to say I've never formally declared my homosexuality, but I've never had a girlfriend or anything so perhaps they are subconsciously aware of it on some level). I know my siblings will support me, my father as well, but I'm not certain as to how my mother will react (she has a tendency to react VERY strongly to things which upset her). I suppose you could say she's the one whom I'm most apprehensive to tell. I'm just wondering on how I should approach this. Earlier I always envisioned telling my parents while they are both simultaneously present, but now I'm beginning to consider telling them individually, which leads to me to worry that whoever I tell second (in this case most likely my mother) will feel hurt that I chose to come out to my father first. In addition to this fact, my siblings and I don't all live under the same roof, so I'm not sure if I should tell them each personally, or sort of just tell my parents and let the word spread on its own. 

So what do you guys think? Have any of you come out individually to your family members or was it more of an announcement in the presence of multiple people? What should I do? How should I even go about coming out once I've decided?

TLDR: Am gay, unsure of whether or not to come out to parents (and siblings) at same time or individually. Also unsure of what exactly the best way to come out would be.
