I'm a 20 year old male and I happen to be homosexual. I have no problem with that *per se* but a lot of the aspects of being gay in today's world really rub me the wrong way. I'm a conservative person by nature and I have what you would call ""traditional values"" about certain things. I'm really quite a prude, and a large part of being gay has to do with sex and it bothers me. It isn't that I don't like, I do. And I'm not a virgin unfortunately. However the topic generally makes me uncomfortable, I'm one of those people who will change the channel if there is a make- out scene or will change the station on the car radio if the song gets too..nasty (first word that came to mind).
This is giving me real problems when dating, it's not that I have an immature fear of sex, it's that I think that there is a time and place for it (in the bedroom and let's not speak about it). For instance, I met a guy through a mutual friend and we went out to eat at a diner. He seemed nice enough at first but it bothered me when he referred to me as ""hot"" like it really grossed me out to think that we just met each other and he is looking at me as a sex object instead of a good guy who can offer someone a good and stable future. Why can't I be ""handsome"" or ""really nice""? Those generally flattering things whereas hot means ""I want to sleep with you.""
I brushed that off and didn't say anything and we started having a conversation about our lives and what we do etc. and while I was telling him about my job and traveling, he threw in a couple of jokes with sexual innuendo and although I was too polite to say anything I did look at him funny because it was odd, I'm looking for someone to spent my life with not some snarky pervert to crack jokes about sausage with. 
I got really set off when I told him about what I'm studying (neuroscience) and he said ""well, that doesn't sound very sexy."" I had had enough and basically told him that it doesn't *have* to be sexy because it's interesting and important to me, and to most normal people. He then proceeded to apologize and say ""Ok, I'll change the subject - so are you a top or a bottom?"" And I almost vomited and basically threw down $15 on the table for my meal and left. He texted me to tell me *how rude I was*.

This has been a common occurrence, not to the extreme of me walking out but me being disgusted with how loosely most Gay men my age throw around sexual words/concepts/actions so flippantly and then are confused when I'm offended. Straight people are guilty too obviously, but not to that extent because if a straight man asked a woman (who wasn't a tramp) about her preferred sexual acts over a 1st date, he would get slapped.

I'm afraid I am not going to find anyone because unfortunately by definition I will only be dating other gay men, and gay men are the sexually open, liberal (I'm talking values-wise, not politics) people on earth and I'm a prude with 1950's values.

I wasn't raised this way, actually the opposite I was raised in a. progressive"" non-prudish, liberal household and as I came of age I developed more conservative ways, maybe as a reaction to my surroundings. I don't know, I'm not complaining I like who I am but it makes things very difficult. While most gay men my age were on Grindr I was finding religion. It's not that I hate being gay or hate sex, I just have a sense of propriety that most people my age (regardless of sexual preference) do not have.

I'm not asking a question here, but I'm a solitary person and while I don't mind not having anyone close enough to me to share things with, sometimes it's difficult to not have peers to offer you feedback. That's why I'm ranting here, so that you guys can offer me feedback.

Enjoy your Thanksgiving guys (if you're in the US). I am glad to be spending today resting alone because I have. I work or school.

Jay and I met in college out of coincidence we were taking same classes often. After we ran into each other often what started off as class talk evolved into buddy buddy talks. He came out to me first after a few month of knowing each other and I came out to him almost a year later. The friendship was all good and dandy. We got really close and I got feelings for him, and like I had suspected I got thrown into the zone. But hey atleast I said what I had to say. We took a break after that to break the emtional awkwardness and the friendship continued and actually got deeper, which had its pros and cons. Pros was that we officially labeled ourselves as each others BFFs and what not. We went clubbing, went to a bathhouse, went to events and I wingmaned for him( which til this day he has not done for me which is only a small issue). Cons was that the emtional roller coaster, especially when he got drunk, started which was not so present before. Which was hard considering I had been shot down, I felt like my emotions were being played with a lot in return. I never mention this because he would always come back with BS saying he never said this or that. But I held through because were close, and we had dealed with BS in the past and got through it. Mainly ego BS since we are both certified assholes. 

And I guess the real ticking time bomb for me after all this for me trying to seperate friendship from past and constantly reemerging emotion was when he had a bit of a scare after he barebacked with some guy and he got sort of maniacal and started asking life end questions of ""do you think me an you could have worked out?"" ""Do you wonder if we could have built something together""? while infuriating internally, I answered no, and quickly moved off that topic because it's useless answering truthfully. And we are here now, he is in a 2 month relationship and I already see signs of me being pushed off. And I met the guy, guy is truly POS one of those snobbish people which is another reason I'm getting disconnected with Jay. I am not going to deal with his daily emotional shit, and I mean everyday because he has to call me everyday, about his issues. Never a positive

( Might I just mention he has this thing for always on being in dating mode, it's like his life has no meaning if he wasn't looking for someone.)

Which he tries to push on me when I say I'm not looking for that shit right now because I want to enjoy being single in my 20's  for a bit so I can do shit on my time. But apart from this after thinking back, I always put more into this friendship than he did. And he stupidly acknowledges it unintentionally sometimes because he thinks I'm not listening. But the low down is he is becoming an unnecessary weight in my life. Why should I struggle in my life to deal with him if he's not going to reciprocate the weight I put in.

After reading this what's your take on the over all situation? Drop or no drop?

Realistically, I'm not making any plans and I hate melodrama, really, and there's no way for me to confess this that doesn't feel like I'm being melodramatic, but in high school, my mother said to me if you're having thoughts like that, you have to say something. Well, I'm having those thoughts. I can't stop them, they're just coming up all by themselves. I'm depressed. Not like 'sad', like the symptoms of depression. I'm tired, I feel pointless, and nothing that I usually enjoy seems enjoyable to me. No motivation. No appetite. I feel more sick to my stomach than hungry.

I'm 29, I only came out like 3 years ago because I'm a worthless sack of shit who's afraid of his own shadow, apparently. There's the melodrama again. I'll be 30 in a couple months. Kind of pathetic, I know.

I'm running a business photographing weddings. I've been gritting my teeth for years, watching people get married. But recently, I'm not doing a very good job of it anymore and my work is slipping. I'm starting to resent my clients. It's not like they did anything to me. Most of them are great. But I still resent them.

I've been working really closely with a colleague for years. I developed a strong crush on him, in spite of him being straight. Since then, the heat of that crush has mostly subsided, but my feelings linger, emblematic of my self-pity. Especially if I see a little skin. I have so many people close to me, who I've invested in and cared about for so long, but none of them are capable of investing in me enough to plan life together.

I don't like thinking about having sex with guys--unless its pure fantasy, like porn or something. I'm upset by the idea of being 'penetrated' in some way. These people I'm already close to seem to be the only ones my mind can settle the idea of actually having sex with. Which, is obviously not possible, or even healthy for me, if it were possible.

I slowly tried to work myself up to having public profiles on things like OkCupid and Grindr. I forced myself to be outgoing and to meet as many people as I could. I tried flirting, and even fooling around a little bit. It upset me. After almost a year of that, I'm feeling like I just don't fit in anywhere. Sex is a big deal, it seems. Where 'chastity' was perhaps a virtue when I was dating women, it seems more like a notch against me now.

I don't want a dick, I want a best friend.

I just want to say fuck everything. I know this is all a perspective issue. I know altogether too much about how the brain works, and I keep wanting to just work it out in my mind. But pangs just hit me in the gut anyway, sometimes almost nonstop, sometimes just randomly when I seem to be otherwise alright. If it's a matter of having a bad perspective, how am I suppose to make the *right* perspective *mine*? How do I feel it?!

You know, I know it's a bad attitude, and a lot of gay people are rightly offended by the notion--but--I just want to be straight again. No, not that I ever was straight, but it felt like I was. I still don't 'feel' gay. Ugh. I guess I haven't let go of that fantasy life I spent so long building in my mind.

What's wrong with me? What the *fuck* is my problem?

I don't know what's his problem but this wasn't the first time. He made a Jewish joke when we were at Oktoberfest, and he called his AC repairman a negro.

I like getting attention and praise online. Hell, that's why certain subreddits exist (/r/gaybrosgonewild or the mild version). But at the same time I can't help but feel a bit vain using them to post pictures just for likes or with insinuating poses. Also, I am at the same tame envious and slightly disdainful (""how shallow of them"") of all the likes and interaction people get.

I'm also a medical student and in a few years I'll be a licensed doctor working in my countries health system. While steps can be taken to maintain privacy, I can't help but feel uneasy posting even a slightly sexualized photo or even favouriting sexual photos. After all, future patients and colleagues would be able to access them quite easily.

So, TL;DR version: **I really like the validation from posting photos online on social networks and getting likes, especially if there's a slight sexual overtone.

I was confused for a long and didn&amp;#39;t help that my family is pretty conservative (surprise surprise), but I realized what my sexual identity was about two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have zero interest in dating nor having sex. All I want is to form friendships with other gay men. I have plenty of straight friends who are completely accepting of me, but none of them really know the daily struggle of living in an environment where you have to be closeted lest you get berated, or worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do any of you know of any good resources for looking for genuine friendship? Or better yet, if you live in this region would you be willing to hang out with a giant nerdy gay dude who is into Final Fantasy and MTG? &lt;/p&gt;

I'm in my mid 20's and recognized that I'm bi last year. But I was in a great relationship  so it's all been cool. 

Now that I'm single, I want to meet dudes as well and see how that goes. Hell, I even have a few matched on Tinder :-)

Although, I have a few concerns 

1) I'm still in the closet. This is something I plan on dealing with asap. I'm sure this is a case by case thing for all dudes so I guess I just want to get some insight.

2)I don't know how to be like ""Hey, I'm new here"".

3) I want to be upfront about this being my first time but, don't want anyone to feel like an experiment.

What are your thoughts on these? How did you guys do it?

Thank god I'm around the NYC area but I admittedly don't have many LGBT friends yet. So I'm kinda nervous about just going into a scene and a landscape I don't know much about. I'm hoping to meet people via Tinder / Grinder / reddit and hopefully branch out from there.

Edit: Just wanted to thank you all for your insight. The gist of it is that I need to figure out what I want, communicate that :-)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just got out of a 4 year LTR with a girl a few months ago.

This shocked me, I just assumed that anyone who was homophobic was automatically repulsed by us, is this not the case?


Also interestingly a lot of banks seem to support diversity in them but I thoughts they were some of the most republican bastards ever.

I need to ask you, how do I flirt?  
Let me explain: I've liked guys, I like guys, and I probably will still like them in the future, but I never had the guts, or, I should say, the *technique* to approach them correctly. I have to say that I'm terribly shy, that has often stopped me from flirting with guys.  
Now, I want to ask you for a guideline: there's this guy at my university. He often studies in our library. He's very cute, and I would like to know more about him, but we don't know one another. How should I act? What is the correct way to flirt?  
Or, even better, what do you do when you want to flirt? What would you do in my situation?
Thanks everyone for your time :)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone!&lt;br/&gt;
