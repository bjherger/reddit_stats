""To me, this sounds stupid and childish.

I am not the person that when asked for advice to be able to give any actual advice that have any actual meaning. I would just spit out some general BS just to get out of the situation.

I know that I have no real reason to be judged but I also know that there are a lot of people out there that have views and act in ways that are not right in any means.



I am a fairly big workaholic; I am passionate about everything that I do in my job, plus I have very long work days and  a lot of work days in a week. No matter what I do on my own and if I get instructed to accomplish something, I put out a product that I am proud with putting my name on and claim as my work. Since I hold my work in very high regard, I want my peers and superiors to view me by my product quality, work ethic, and customer appreciation. I view the work place as exactly that; a place where work is to be done and personal lives and other qualities of a person have no place. But at my workplace and at a majority of other jobs, there is some free time for when coworkers talk about their personal lives. Many see this time as just a way to relax and have a little escape from the work day. People take these breaks and talk about anything they want within their little cliques, but since everyone is human, they gossip and something that is unfavorable my spread around the job site and make its way to some senior leader.

Because I am very hesitant to say anything with any sort of substance unless it pertains to some product that I have made and knowledge that I have that pertains to the job directly, people view me as cold, distant, and unemotional.



I have been at the same workplace for a couple of years now, and every peer around me has been acknowledged and awarded/promoted for sub-optimal work just because they share some of their personal life. I can’t comprehend this because I have a very compartmentalized view of everything and this is even more reason to hold back on my feelings and personal life because I am afraid of the unknown events that will occur  if I let loose anything. The unknown scares the shit out of me because I don’t take any risks what so ever. I always collect as much information as possible before I do anything.

I'm aware that this is not a dating site. However, since I've been looking for a boyfriend for a very long time now, and have exhausted all other avenues I would like to give this message board a try.

I'm a twenty-four year old gay Indian guy living in the UK. I've never had a boyfriend. Until one month ago I was even a virgin. The reason why I'm mentioning this is that I'd rather be upfront from the start to avoid any more disappointments. I've had a lot of disappointments in the past with guys.

I would describe myself as quite physically attractive. My only flaw is a bald spot at the back of my head. My height is 5'6. I'm skinny and tan. I could pass for a straight guy and am looking for someone similar, no fem guys please.

My personality has been described as nothing short of amazing. I'm charming, hard-working, and have a great sense of humour. I'm introverted, and therefore can come across as rude to some people. Yet the vast majority of people understand. 

I have a steady job and income, even though I have not achieved my career goals yet. I'm also at university. Academics are an area of my life in which I'm quite successful. My research is award-winning, and has been lauded with praise. 

My interests are photography, fashion, movies, and music.

I still live with family but am hoping to move out quite soon, even though doing so would mean quite a financial struggle for me. I haven't come out to them yet, and don't think I could, since in our culture gays are not accepted.

I'm top but lately have been considering bottoming as well. I'm a very curious person after all ;). Since some guys have an issue with this I think it would be better right now if I told you straight up that I'm circumcised.

That's all about me. What I'm looking for is a physically attractive guy, since physical attraction is very important to me. Apart from physically, you also need to be very emotionally available. I'd want someone warm and loving who can read my moods, and is understanding and accepting of my needs. Ideally, you would be around my own age.

Thanks for reading all of this. I'd be very happy for people to get in touch with me.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m aware that this is not a dating site. However, since I&amp;#39;ve been looking for a boyfriend for a very long time now, and have exhausted all other avenues I would like to give this message board a try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a twenty-four year old gay Indian guy living in the UK. I&amp;#39;ve never had a boyfriend. Until one month ago I was even a virgin. The reason why I&amp;#39;m mentioning this is that I&amp;#39;d rather be upfront from the start to avoid any more disappointments. I&amp;#39;ve had a lot of disappointments in the past with guys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would describe myself as quite physically attractive. My only flaw is a bald spot at the back of my head. My height is 5&amp;#39;6. I&amp;#39;m skinny and tan. I could pass for a straight guy and am looking for someone similar, no fem guys please.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My personality has been described as nothing short of amazing. I&amp;#39;m charming, hard-working, and have a great sense of humour. I&amp;#39;m introverted, and therefore can come across as rude to some people. Yet the vast majority of people understand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a steady job and income, even though I have not achieved my career goals yet. I&amp;#39;m also at university. Academics are an area of my life in which I&amp;#39;m quite successful. My research is award-winning, and has been lauded with praise. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My interests are photography, fashion, movies, and music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still live with family but am hoping to move out quite soon, even though doing so would mean quite a financial struggle for me. I haven&amp;#39;t come out to them yet, and don&amp;#39;t think I could, since in our culture gays are not accepted.&lt;/p&gt;

So I'm closeted and have had a crush on this guy since high school. He's really hot. Thick black hair, tall, handsome face, goofy-funny, not self obsessed or douchey at all, etc. He's also straight, unfortunately. He was like ""the hot guy"" when I was in school. I was in marching band with him, but never really talked much to him because I was always *super* awkward around him. I would never know what to say and would just get really nervous and really shy which sometimes comes off as snobby. I always am shy around good looking guys. I'm pretty sure he picked up on it and thinks I'm a little weird.  I was really awkward in high school, but have since grown into my looks and become...slightly more confident I guess. 

ANYWAY. He moved away for college and I only occasionally thought about him. 

Fast forward a couple years. I was at the gym to renew my membership this evening and to my surprise, caught a glimpse of him working out and *sigh* OH. MY. GOD. Boy's been *hitt'n* that gym. He looks like an extra for the movie 300. Now he's super handsome, charming, **AND** jacked. My stomach flipped. Pretty sure he saw me, but I pretended not to see him and causally left.

I'm probably going to see him more, because he obviously uses the gym a lot and I'm starting to get back in shape.

I don't know whether to try to talk to him, I don't know if there would be a point to that. Even if I did manage to not be super awkward and start some sort of a casual gym friendship or something I probably only would be thinking about jumping on him. I could just keep avoiding eye contact and never talk to him, I could manage that. That doesn't seem healthy though. I don't want to not use the gym just because he uses it, that seems stupid.

What's the most reasonable thing to do in this situation?

I am currently subletting an apartment with two other people.  There are four rooms, three of which are occupied.  

Room A - a super loud, antisocial middle aged man, who is possible having an affair with an older woman.  He's very shady, and leaves around 5:30 AM every morning with no bag. 

Room B - Laura, a student on a co-op job.  She comes home around 6:30, and every evening at 8:30 she makes popcorn.  I NEVER hear her, and sometimes she doesn't come home for days at a time.  

Room C- sadly unoccupied. The unoccupied room was taken at first, but when the girl arrived to move in she backed out right away leaving the owner to eat the cost.  The reason she didn't want to move in? Cigarette smell from Room A (beside the front door)

Room D- sexy gay guy (me).

In January I mentioned to the owner that someone was smoking (we all knew who).  It was Room A, and the landlord had a talk with him.  His Excuse was ""i'm just lazy, I know I could use the balcony.  I will try"" 

Tonight he had a guy in his 50's come over the check out the room.  He said he had to be gone by Friday, and wanted this done quickly.  He pays $380/mth with the lease ending April 30.  He offered this guy $300/mth and said cash.  Asked for $100 deposit.  The possible new tenant called the landlord and then backed out immediately.  I don't think you can sublet a room if you are the subletter?   The current guy, I call him Black Thunder because he's black and SUPER loud.  I am down the hall and listening to his conversation with doors closed.  He is saying he is going to "" fuck Betty over and have the cheques bounce"".  Betty is the girl who owns his room, and who showed me the apartment.  I don't personally know her, but I can contact her.  I have her number. 

He is intending to take cash for the room, then leave and have his cheques bounce.  He gets paid, Betty doesn't get paid and the new potential roommate pays money to the wrong person.  Black Thunder also said on the phone he was going to empty his account, so money can't be drawn from it.

Again, I don't know Betty and have no allegiance to her - but I don't want to see her screwed over.  This guy's presense already made one roommate back out leaving the owner to pay the room herself

The quickest synopsis I can give is that my boyfriend doesn't want to have sex with me anymore. He still masturbates though and, as a result, I feel fucking awful. 

Here's the longer story. He and I met over a year ago. When we weren't living together and we saw each other twice a month the sex was fantastic. Fast forward 9 months later and we moved in together. Everything was great for the first few months. Then I said something stupid during sex (as a joke) and he got the impression I didn't like having sex with him. Thus, we stopped having sex. Two weeks later I found out he had been exchanging dirty pictures with someone else. When I confronted him he swore he hadn't cheated on me (and I am pretty sure he didn't) and that he needed a sexual release since he thought I wasn't interested in sex. I apologize and explained I said something stupid and that I really do like the sex. Many tears were exchanged and we got past it. I really do believe that he never cheated on me.

However, a month later is when problems started. He just completed stopped wanting sex with me. I brought up the issue three or four times and each time he swears it's not me; he just says that his sex drive disappeared. I said okay and, while it sucked, I would deal with it until he (hopefully) got it back. The problem is that I often find out that he masturbates while I'm away. For example, I was gone the past weekend and every night he jerked off. This makes me feel unbelievably awful. I could understand if he simply didn't have a sex drive but now it feels as though he simply doesn't want to have sex with me. I've asked him that directly before and every time he swears it's not true. This, combined with everything else about our relationship (that I don't feel like typing and hope that you'll just trust me), makes me think he really does want me to remain his boyfriend. I can't live feeling awful every other week though. I feel like absolute shit because my own boyfriend doesn't want to have sex with me (and instead wants to have it with other people).

I told him two weeks ago that I could hold out until August because that's when we're going to move to a new states and he's going to get a new job that he doesn't hate. The reason I said that is because I figured his current job was killing his sex drive. But knowing about his solo activities makes me doubt this and so I don't think it'll get any better after August. If you guys don't have some words of wisdom for me then maybe I just won't bother waiting until August and I'll end things now. I really can't handle the pain in my stomach anymore every time I think about this. 

And if my boyfriend reads this: I'm really sorry for posting all of this online but I don't know what else to do. We've talked about this and nothing comes of it except tears. I really do love you and want our relationship to last because absolutely EVERYTHING else about it is perfect.

I've never had a boyfriend. Until one month ago I was even a virgin.

I don't have many friends either, but I do have some. I struggle with feeling lonely, especially on public holidays. My friends don't support me enough on days like Christmas and Valentine's Day. I live with family who don't even know I'm gay because gays are not accepted in our culture.

For example, on Christmas Day I felt so lonely that I texted several friends. Most of them didn't even reply. Some only replied a few days later when I didn't even feel lonely anymore. A few did reply immediately. I was happy about that, and tried to make plans with them for another day. Their responses weren't enthusiastic, and no plans ever materialised. So, I got annoyed and stopped texting them.

New Year's Eve and New Year's Day were even worse for me. I kept waiting for friends to invite me to New Year's Eve parties or for anything really. None ever did. Therefore I was forced to spend New Year's Eve and New Year's Day with family. On New Year's Day I decided to punish my friends by texting them before lunch, wishing them ""A Happy New Year to you too"". My plan was to wake up anyone who still had a hangover, and I'm sure a lot of them would have been that hungover. I'm really upset that my friends aren't more supportive. Who needs enemies with friends like that?

On Valentine's Day, again, my friends failed to support me, even though they should have realised that since I'm single I'd be very lonely and depressed. Therefore I sent them some angry texts to punish them. I hope that's finally taught them to be better friends.

Are there any other singles on here with unsupportive friends?

All our lodgings are booked, as is the car, so let's road trip away woop!

Here's our itinerary:
New Orleans - March 5-9 (Acadiana is in here too since he's francophone and interested in French Louisiana)
Houston - March 9-10 (basically just to sleep Monday night)
San Antonio - March 10-11 (Tuesday night)
Austin - March 11-13 (Wednesday &amp; Thursday night)
New Orleans - March 13-14 (Friday night)

I know it's a lot of driving, but I generally like driving on American highways and checking out all the small communities along the way. I also know it's the start of SXSW in Austin, so if there are any gay events going on, info would be awesome!

So, I have dated women my entire life and find them incredibly sexy. However, a number of years ago i found myself horny and alone. Enter craigslist. The sneaking around. Fake email accounts. Making up what i was doing. Having girlfriends but not feeling myself. People asking if i was gay because of how i look and dress

I always received head or was rimmed. Eventually i topped a guy. The entire time i was doing this, years mind you, I was straight to the world. Girlfriends etc. Constant guilt, shame, concerns about my masculinity. I would watch gay porn and jerk off, only to feel disgusted afterwards. I got into shemale porn after a while but it was always guys getting topped. 

Eventually i decided i wanted to try bottoming because i live being rimmed. Tried it and loved it. Tried bottoming with ts/tg. Went to a few gay bars. Never really felt like i fit in there. 

It is on my mind a lot. However,  because of my job and roommate situation, i still am very secretive about this. I kind of saw a younger guy when i moved recently but he was pushy and not really my style. Closest thing to dating. I have taken to grindr amd tinder but am worried about going on dates in public.

I find certain men attractive and yet have never been sexually attracted to a man. Maybe it is the overwhelming heterosexual culture or the way i was raised. I don't know. I want to try dating. I have never kissed a man. I have never really had the intimacy like i have with a woman. Maybe because I'm scared or nervous i wont won't measure up. Or i am worried about what people will think. 

Is this a regular occurrence?  I guess i just wanted to get that off my chest. Not really sure what else to say or do right now.

**Disclaimer 2:** Though some might read this cynically and think, ‘Well, gee, what’s the point, then?’, it’s important to note that this is *not* meant to be a negative message.  On the contrary, my only hope is to realign people’s expectations with reality in order to minimize bad experiences with gay dating and hook-ups, particularly on gay apps and in gay bar settings.  Please try to look at that underlying positive message and use it to create better experiences for yourself!

##Out of Your League: Why Shooting for the Stars Can Bring You Down

The gay world (and online dating in general) is quickly changing with the ever-increasing prevalence of apps.  Apps are quite unusual in the sense that now, more than ever, we have a lot of access to a lot of different guys at the tap of a finger.  With little effort, we can scroll through pictures of guys, send messages, get to know each other, and set up dates or rendezvouses.  Never before has it been so easy for gay men to meet.

There are a lot of hot guys on many of these apps.  And, of course, the natural response to seeing a hot guy is to want to message them.  In our age of fighting against social norms, one common theme among many individuals is the idea that “leagues” don’t exist.  The notion of someone being “out of your league” (or, the “class” of individuals who you have a chance with) has been around for a while.  Humans tend to lump each other into dichotomous categories, and “leagues” are no different.  Of course, we want to naturally fight against created notions like leagues.  Everything, from romantic comedies to Taylor Swift songs, tend to root for the ~~girl~~ boy in the bleachers to end up with the quarterback instead of the cheerleader.  As a society, we tend to hate the idea of “leagues” and hope that people will look to the inside, past outward appearances and stereotypes.

This is sure as hell predominant among my friends.  I hear things like “Oh, I don’t have a chance with this guy, but I’m going to message him anyway,” and “God, he’s so hot, I have to message him!” all the time.  They want to believe that, despite their intuition, they have a legitimate shot with this incredibly hot guy, and if he doesn’t respond, he’s at fault for missing out.  This view is also very prevalent on this sub.  For example, take some of the highest rated comments on questions in recent months that asked about “leagues”:

&gt;People really need to let this ""Out of my league"" crap go. There's no such thing. What people look like is completely separate from what that person may be attracted to. They literally have not a single thing to do with each other.

|

&gt;I've said it before and I'll say it again: there's no such things as ""leagues,"" there's just people who will give you a chance, and people who won't.

|

&gt;No such thing as being above or below someone's ""league"". Everyone is different and has different strengths, interests, characteristics, etc.


.


This fits with the rosy view that we are all individuals, have good attributes to offer, and deserve to be given a chance.  It’s nice to think like this – and it *does* make sense, because I think we can all agree that it’s true, to an extent.  There is much more to a person than pure aesthetics, and to reduce someone to just how good they look means you’ll be missing on tons of great qualities from great guys.  However, as nice as this sentiment seems on the surface, it’s problematic for a number of reasons:

###Problem 1
It completely misses the mark on how people *actually* operate.  Do you deserve to be given a chance to showcase who you are, regardless of your looks?  Yes, absolutely!  Are you going to get it?  Most likely not, unfortunately.  At the end of the day, this boils down to a supply-and-demand problem.  By the law of averages, there are **way** more average-looking guys than regulation hotties.  Yet, who do you think are getting the majority of messages?  The hotties, of course.  It’s like the 1% of Gay World.  My friend was telling me a story where five of them were grindr’ing at an airport and had a friendly contest to see who would get the most messages from guys in a short amount of time.  The winner had five times the amount of guys message him in the timeframe as the second place person (25 messages vs. 5 messages).  Many of you probably have had similar experiences – it baffles you that you barely can get any dates, while your friend is (potentially literally) swimming in dick, or vice-versa.  

That hot guy does not have time to respond to all 25 of those messages.  And since that hot guy is getting probably getting mad dick, he has even *less* time or need to respond to all of those messages.  You know what that leads to?  Probably about 22 or 23 guys who get either ignored, blocked, or a curt “no thanks” reply.  Which leads me to the next problem:

###Problem 2
This is DESTROYING our self-esteem.  I know what you’re thinking, ‘But, dude, I’m not expecting a response back.  I know these guys aren’t going to be into me!  But it’s worth a shot right?  You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take. ~~-Wayne Gretzky~~  -Michael Scott’

This is flawed thinking.  When ~~Wayne~~ Michael Scott said that, he wasn’t saying, “Fuck it, shoot it as soon as you get the puck, wherever you are!”  He was talking about *good* shots.  Any coach will probably be much angrier at an absolutely terrible shot than a missed opportunity where you still have possession of the ball.  However, one bad shot in a while happens – people get excited and go for it.  What gets the coach the *maddest* is when a player consistently takes horrible shots he has no chance of making.

This is gay app life to a tee.  If you’re messaging a ton of hot guys and you’re not getting responses, you’re doing something wrong.  You might argue that you are aware of your slim chances and want to try it anyway, and that it can’t hurt, right?  Again, this is flawed thinking.  No matter how used to it you get, rejection still hurts.  You might convince yourself that it’s no big deal and it was “worth a shot,” but if you’re messaging guys out of your league day in and day out, it becomes a tiny little parasite to your self-esteem, and slowly eats away at you.  All of us, no matter how experienced, how good-looking, how confident, etc., have a hard time with rejection, even subconsciously.  We condition ourselves to think we’re okay with it, but deep down, it bothers all of us.  The “why am I not good enough?” feeling, however brief, hurts.  And it’s always still there, even if we’re so used to mass messaging on Grindr that we feel numb to it.  It’s still cutting away at our self-esteem, except constant rejection has completely desensitized us to it.  Which brings us to my last problem:

###Problem 3
The lie that “there are no such things as leagues” tricks us into playing out of our league, so we end up missing connections with guys who *can* and *would* be a good match.  Let’s go back to my first anecdote, where the one guy got 25 messages and the other guy only got 5.  I guarantee you that some of those guys who were rejected by the first guy would be a *really* good match for the second guy.  However, the majority of the time, I bet neither of them ever message each other.  Guys tend to have the mentality of “Oh, I’ll message the *really hot* guys and then wait for other guys to message me.”  I see and hear this all the time.  This doesn’t work if everyone is doing it, and many of us are.  Guys who are less likely to flake and more likely to be willing enter a relationship are the guys who are on “our level.”  Except many gay guys play some sort of chicken game with each other and wait for the other guy to message him first.  It’s ridiculous.

What’s the takeaway?  Be honest with yourself and the kind of guy you have a *realistic shot* of actually snagging.  Think of an app like a gay bar or other social setting where you are meeting others face-to-face.  You have limited time and energy to spend.  If you’re at a bar, are you going to hit on the gorgeous guy who you deep down know is not going to go home with you, because there are way better-looking guys than you there?  Or, are you going to chat up the less-hot-but-still-cute guy at the bar who’s more on your level?  Chances are, the second guy is a hell of a lot more likely to be willing to take the time to sit, talk, and get to know the *real you*.  That’s the time to showcase your good traits and qualities.  Because the hot guy that’s out of your league doesn’t have the time or energy to see them, and even if you are technically a “perfect fit,” you’re never going to know, because he has limited time and, as harsh as this sounds, you’re not at the top of his list of prospects.  

I think the results from this can be very therapeutic to gay guys.  Guess how good getting a lot of responses to the messages you send feels…you’re right, great!  When we stop throwing Hail Marys to the top guys and instead throw consistent, respectable completions, we’re much more likely to score.  And that increased response percentage rate feels *damn good*.  It also helps each other.  Instead of boosting a handful of guys’ egos, we can spread the love and reach a much more realistic distribution of messages.  By conditioning ourselves to stay within “our league,” all of the guys who aren’t in the top percentiles of hotness end up winning – and finding someone great in the process.

It also can be a means to help improve ourselves.  Forcing yourself to stay “in your league” can be an eye-opening experience.  For some, being honest with oneself might even come as a shock.  Really?  I’m not as great as I thought I was?  No, you’re not.  Sorry.  That’s why you’re getting shit luck on things like Grindr.  And as sucky as that feeling might be, it’s better in the long run.  That way, you’re in a much better position to find something good and worthwhile, instead of chasing your tail in the delusion hope of getting a super-hot guy.  Some people might not be happy with their new-found “league,” and the good thing about leagues is that they’re not static!  Things like diet, exercise, wardrobe changes, haircuts, skincare regimens, and even little fixes like posture improvement and teeth whitening can and do make one more desirable to other men.  So if you don’t like where you stack up, then go and do something about it!  Get your ass off reddit and to the gym or the dentist or whatever.  If you can’t afford it, then do pushups in your room or shoplift Crest Whitening Strips or whatever.  There’s always something you can do to make yourself better.  But you need to be real with yourself and honest about your “league” of potential matches first.

I guess that wasn’t a question as much as an essay.  I felt like it needed to be said, more so to my friends (who this was mainly written for), but also to all of you.  I’d appreciate any comments or thoughts or things that should be added!

Stay awesome, all of you.  No matter what “league” you’re in, there’s an awesome guy out there for you – you just need to keep yourself sane and happy while you work on finding him.
","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer 1:&lt;/strong&gt;  In this post, I am going to make some sweeping generalizations.  I, by no means, mean to imply that what I’m saying here applies for &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; guys in &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; circumstances.  However, I am fairly convinced that the following messages will be generally applicable to most circumstances, based on not only my experiences, but the experiences of friends and fellow redditors.  Please take it to heart, but don’t accept it as always true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Though some might read this cynically and think, ‘Well, gee, what’s the point, then?’, it’s important to note that this is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; meant to be a negative message.  On the contrary, my only hope is to realign people’s expectations with reality in order to minimize bad experiences with gay dating and hook-ups, particularly on gay apps and in gay bar settings.  Please try to look at that underlying positive message and use it to create better experiences for yourself!&lt;/p&gt;

Do you know what people im speaking of? They are the people that go around knocking on doors preaching and handing out Watchtower stuff.

I feel stuck. My parents are baptized JWs lol they have been baptized for over 25 years. I grew up as a JW but thankfully never got baptized. 

My parents know that I dont believe in their GOD. I respect their beliefs but I dont feel that their faith is for me. I would rather be dammed forever even if Jehovah is real :P what type of God makes people change who they are. I did not choose to be gay.

Anyways! I am 20 lol but my parents keep insisting that I have a bible study with one of the close family friends in the Kingdom Hall (church) that we go to. I've been having the study for about 3 years now even though I knew all about the religion before the study even started because I was raised in it. 

My parents both know that im gay. They have known for 6 years.

Idk what to do. Theres not really any talking that could help I think.  My parents just say me and my feelings are wrong. They get upset if I say that I dont want to study anymore or go to any of the meetings anymore.

I feel alone. I dont have any non JW friends.

What to do in this situation? The bible study and meetings are only making me feel upset and sad. I wish my parents would at least try to see why I may feel uncomfortable being involved in this religion. 

This is not easy. I think I am going to lose all of my friends when I get out of this town someday.

I got meeting tonight. Im dreading it.

I will respect my parent's rules as long as I live in their house. I will even attend the meetings without saying anything negative. I just mainly want to stop having weekly bible studies. How do I manage to do this?

I adore my mom and daddy. I look up to them. I dont believe in their faith though.

Sorry for venting. I dont have anyone to really talk to about any of this. I try to with my mother but she always ends up shouting and getting sad.

The religion is tough. Me writing this post could even be considered ""poison and sinful lies"" to the elders that run the Kingdom Hall that I attend. Your not supposed to even read anything against the religion because they say ""Jehovah is the only truth"". I know some people have harder lives than myself but this is so tricky to be apart of. Theres many more examples of the faith being tough to break out of.

Im just ranting now lol sorry!!!! 

I hope I've said enough. I feel I may be missing something.

Just a little disclaimer first as I know I'm not the best person to say eloquently what I mean: I will try and get my feelings and worries out about this situation without offending anyone. This whole thing is about my brother- I want him to be safe and do things in a way he's not going to regret in the future!

So, this is something our dad told me today- my brother is apparently dating a man in his mid-thirties, and because my dad obviously not that crazy/comfortable with talking about this kind of thing, he has just shied away from it. All that has been going through my mind since is- who the hell is this guy?! I feel like he's taking advantage of my young, naive brother (and he is naive); I am worried what they are doing together- is my brother being pressured into doing things he doesn't want to do? Does my brother even KNOW what he wants yet? He is surely just figuring gay life out for himself!

What makes it worse is when I've spoken to my friends before about the lgbt community (esp. at parades etc.) all I've heard is how much everything is about sex; not whether you like someone or not, but ""are you a giver or receiver"". What makes me panic even more is what one lesbian friend told me about gay males giving each other HIV/AIDS on purpose because it then means you're ""actually"" gay! (EDIT I feel stupid for believing this, I have been told this doesn't happen, sorry guys!)

I take an interest in my brother's life (I am his big sister after all), and I know if I approach him directly about being safe etc. he will just shut off and not talk to me properly because he will think I am berating him for the sake of it. I have sent him a text already saying ""Hey! Didn't know you were seeing someone at the mo ;D all going well?"", to which he replied he is seeing three guys at once??!!

I want him to be safe and know all the dangers that come with dating older guys but I also want the 30-something sicko to stop cradle-robbing my little brother!! In my mind, if this guy loves my brother so much (not that it's been said he does), he would understand that his family are going to be apprehensive (understatement) about them dating, and would have tried to meet us/contact us in some way so we know he's not just some paedophile! My brother has told me he's been seeing guys for about a year now (not sure if that's different ones, all three he's dating now or whatever else) and all through high school he didn't have boyfriends/girlfriends

I'm looking for advice on how to handle this situation because my dad is not doing anything about it (I am 21 and when I was my bro's age and out/about with boyfriends (that had to meet my parents first) I had a curfew of 9pm, my dad EXTREMELY strictly enforced this, and now he's telling me that my brother can go out til all hours with some middle-aged bloke he's never met before! It's like he's given up caring!!) Please, if you guys have been through anything similar I'd like to hear what you did about it; I can't think about anything else today!!

**EDIT**: He's just text me about his situation with these three guys but it sounds like something he's either read a definition of online, or someone has brainwashed this thought into him- *""I'm a relationship anarchist; which means that I'm not mono, poly etc. All I have are friends who I happen to have any combo of platonic, sexual and/or romantic relationships with""*

This might or might not be something you all have heard before, so bear with me since I'm still wondering.


To give you guys some background: I'm 20, living in the Southern US, in college, and recently out to friends / general public (like... 3-4 months), and never been on a date much less sexy time with another guy.


Basically, here's how it is: Whether through societal conditioning, how I view life and love, or both, I can't go through with any sort of NSA casual sex meetup.


All other parts of my life are in order. I'm excelling in my major, have had multiple job offers, have no debt, great friends, etc. Everything is in order... except a relationship, which is something I'd really like to have. But, more importantly, I'd like a relationship with someone I feel attracted to, not just another good friend (I have those). And, just like many other gaybros here, I fall victim to basically only falling for straight guys (to which I must convince myself not to act on anything and feel increasingly sad about it). 


 I want all the lovey dovey feelings, exploring sexuality, being good friends and helping and supporting each other. In short, I think I want the high school relationship I never had (with a guy). Now, I'm going into this like a high school relationship... but at the same time, I think that's what I want...? This seems to be difficult.


So... of course I start looking on apps, dating websites, etc. trying to find someone who peaks my interest.  The pool is very small for me down here. The result: If I feel attracted to them, they're not interested or looking for NSA. If I'm not attracted to them, they're looking for a relationship. Bad luck, or recurring theme? (or am I just ugly? rofl)


I find it very difficult to find people I'm attracted to on apps/websites. I'm attracted to the idea of a loving relationship (very childish it seems) and most gay porn doesn't do it for me ( no, straight porn definitely doesn't do it).


The only person I've ever hit it off with and felt like things were going somewhere is 500 miles away and it's not going to work any time soon.


So here's my discussion question: When should I throw out the idea of starting a relationship through dating and start looking at casual sex as the beginning of a relationship? For me, my mind tells me casual sex doesn't feel like the start of the strong monogamous I'm looking for and I don't have any urges to try it.


Add on the fact I'm going into all of this with 0 experience and the internet as my guide... things are quite difficult for me. I might be 20, but sometimes I feel some horrible mixture between 35 and 13. 


Any advice/help/comments are appreciated.

&lt;p&gt;I find it very difficult to find people I&amp;#39;m attracted to on apps/websites. I&amp;#39;m attracted to the idea of a loving relationship (very childish it seems) and most gay porn doesn&amp;#39;t do it for me ( no, straight porn definitely doesn&amp;#39;t do it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only person I&amp;#39;ve ever hit it off with and felt like things were going somewhere is 500 miles away and it&amp;#39;s not going to work any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;#39;s my discussion question: When should I throw out the idea of starting a relationship through dating and start looking at casual sex as the beginning of a relationship? For me, my mind tells me casual sex doesn&amp;#39;t feel like the start of the strong monogamous I&amp;#39;m looking for and I don&amp;#39;t have any urges to try it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add on the fact I&amp;#39;m going into all of this with 0 experience and the internet as my guide... things are quite difficult for me. I might be 20, but sometimes I feel some horrible mixture between 35 and 13. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any advice/help/comments are appreciated. &lt;/p&gt;
