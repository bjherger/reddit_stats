I was wondering if people had advice for how to act when you see a guy that you ordinarily wouldn't interact with, i.e., a stranger at a place like a coffeeshop, a bar, or even just walking down the street.

My experience with this has been mixed:

* Strike up conversation with guy at coffeeshop, we exchange contact information, meet for dinner, kiss goodbye, and then he never responds to my texts afterwards.

* Briefly speak to guy at coffeeshop, asks him out to drinks, exchange numbers, then via text he says in retrospect he's not really into me.

* Guy I talked to at a bar, we danced for a bit, I asked for his number, and he gave me a fake number. 

* Guy I run into at coffeeshop regularly, I ask for his number, he says email's better for him [!], so I give him my email and then he never writes.

* Similar experiences abound

Thinking back over my past hookups/relationships most are split between having met through hookup apps or having already ""organically"" (i.e., we already were friends/acquaintances, a friend of a friend introduced us, or whatever)

I've only hooked up with three otherwise total strangers whom I had to go out of my way to introduce myself to. And I honestly have no clue how to replicate those; everything just sort of fell together after I started talking to them.

But like, all the time I see cute guys all the time at coffeeshops, or at bars, or just sitting on a bench at the park, or just walking about. And like, I have no clue how to approach people without seeming creepy.

There have been times where, like, I'm walking one way down the street, he's walking the other way, we lock eyes, and just continue on our merry ways cause I'm too chickenshit to stop him. I see guys doing work at the coffeeshop I'm at, and I think, well, he's probably here to do work, not to fend off advances from guys. And the times when I do try, well, see the bullet points above.

So, I dunno, should I just accept that there are certain areas where you shouldn't/can't pick up guys? Do any of you have experience/advice for this?

He was cute, scruffy, eyes of ice, very nice smile. My gaydar was on yellow alert until I found out he had a girlfriend. Despite his GF, he was always hanging around traditional ""fag hags"" in the class (overweight but affectionate women). Also, his girlfriend was Asian-American, which makes me think he might be a little gay/bi (at least by reflecting on my own ""interest"" in women—only Asian women ""turned me on"" in HS).

Fast forward to Jan 2015, and we are now working on a project together in a small group. A few weeks ago, he and his GF of 2-ish years broke up. He hasn't offered a whole lot of information on it, but I know it was mutual. He has been acting considerably more kind and even affectionate toward me. We sometimes lock eyes—and call me crazy—but I think it is sometimes an enamored glance. One time, he insisted on sitting on my at-capacity 3-person couch—next to me of course.

I am definitely attracted to this guy. And I can't help but feel he might be interested in me. At the same time, it could be that he's just friendly and clueless. I want to find out if he has similar feelings, but I'm not sure how to go about it. Should I just be blunt and ask if he's bi? Should I ask if he's ever been with a guy? How and when do I bring this up? Is it even appropriate? How will it change the relationship if I do ask him?

It's been a lot of fun! However I've run into a problem and I could use some advice from some dating pros.

I met this guy and I really like him. We went on a few really casual dates, never heard from him for awhile, figured he wasn't interested and I halfheartedly moved on. But in the process, despite the fact that I had wanted to just date one guy at a time, my friends told me that was a bit old fashioned and I should put myself out there so I did.

So I found someone else and spent a lot of time with him. I really enjoy his company and they way that he makes me feel. He's a stand up guy and holds a lot of my same values. We have a lot of the interests and I've grown to care about him a lot. The only thing is, I'm not as physically attracted to him as I am to the first guy I dated and I find myself questioning if I could love him. With the first guy, it felt so right... I just don't know.

Turns out the first guy I dated was just really busy with work and stressful things and wants to keep seeing me. His friends say that he really likes me a lot and I believe them, he's just a bit flaky.

My friends are saying that I should date both. I'm not really comfortable with that and I've already hinted to the second guy that I would like to be exclusive and he agrees (before it was clear the other guy was still interested). And I really like him. I have a lot in common with him. But my friends keep saying its better to date guys that are different than you. They say I'm going to get bored if I date someone too much like myself. I'm wondering if they are right.

I really like the second guy I met. But I'm more attracted to the first. But I hardly have anything in common with the first. I'm just confused and I feel like I'm already messing things up

I feel like if I'm lucky enough to have found a guy I care about, that I like spending time with, that is super kind, and that I have a lot in common with, I should stick with it for awhile and see where it goes, even if I'm not physically that attracted to him as I am to someone else who wants to date me, but is a huge flake.

&lt;p&gt;Turns out the first guy I dated was just really busy with work and stressful things and wants to keep seeing me. His friends say that he really likes me a lot and I believe them, he&amp;#39;s just a bit flaky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friends are saying that I should date both. I&amp;#39;m not really comfortable with that and I&amp;#39;ve already hinted to the second guy that I would like to be exclusive and he agrees (before it was clear the other guy was still interested). And I really like him. I have a lot in common with him. But my friends keep saying its better to date guys that are different than you. They say I&amp;#39;m going to get bored if I date someone too much like myself. I&amp;#39;m wondering if they are right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really like the second guy I met. But I&amp;#39;m more attracted to the first. But I hardly have anything in common with the first. I&amp;#39;m just confused and I feel like I&amp;#39;m already messing things up&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like if I&amp;#39;m lucky enough to have found a guy I care about, that I like spending time with, that is super kind, and that I have a lot in common with, I should stick with it for awhile and see where it goes, even if I&amp;#39;m not physically that attracted to him as I am to someone else who wants to date me, but is a huge flake. But my friends disagree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thoughts? help!&lt;/p&gt;
