Besides I am pretty sure my brother would kill me if he found out I am posting here.

My brother came out to the family recently (Sadly I found out myself and feel I took away his choice to tell me.) My family as a whole is very supportive of him and we love him just the same. I go through multiple diversity trainings for my on campus jobs, been friends with gay guys since Junior Year of HS and a few of my fraternity brothers are gay so someone’s sexuality is not the defining identity in my eyes.

I went to college last year and therefore was not with my brother at school, where we would normally eat lunch together or just hang out. I have always been protective of him and leaving for college was hard because I felt I couldn’t be there for him like I was before. I know people are not as accepting as my family and I just wish I was there for him. 

He talked to someone in confidence and they started telling other kids at school. It just boils my blood to know kids could do something so fucked up; and I hate not having the power to do something about it. I know if I was there I could have helped him avoid this (I hate the chick and knew she was a two faced bitch.) What I am asking is what advice do you have? How can I still be there for my brother without making it all about his Gay Identity? How can I be a positive influence when I am normally not home. 

I would ask my friends but it is not my place to share to them that he is gay until he is ready to be open about it, so I am coming to reddit for help instead!

I feel really bad, he probably thinks I'm not into him but I did tell him I've been having a lot of *problems* lately and damn I REALLY do want him bad (which I also told him, many times).

This has happened my last couple of sexual encounters too, one was with a really hot older guy and the other was a threesome but I found it extremely difficult to get hard during both.

I'm not on meds and I don't feel any anxiety when I'm doing any of these activities with guys so I don't understand why it's happening, I've had plenty of sexual encounters in the past and I've been able to get hard for them.

The only thing that I think can account for it is the depression I've had this year, it's been a rough year and it's been going really downhill for me. I have noticed it's taken a toll on my sex drive but never have I noticed problems getting erect until recently, it's one thing after another. :/

I'm gay. I guess I accepted it about 8 months. 

I met my ex-girlfriend in kindergarten. We dated from highschool until about 8 months ago. 

She's always been my best friend. Still is. We just refrain from talking about anything to do with relationships and sex right now until we are both content about it. She's OK with being friends and understands. 

I love her to pieces. I wish so bad it could have worked. 

I met my best male friend while dating her. 

As I got to know him I started to crush on him. I still made my girlfriend #1 because I already had her and wanted her to work. But the reminder of what I wish I could have with a man ultimately made me realize I need to leave her. 

This dude has been amazing to me and I've tried to be amazing back. 

He's helped me shower when I'm drunk, picked me up when I was stranded, hung out with me as much as he could when I first broke up with my girlfriend, taken me to a gay bar before I knew anyone else, sat with me at our college lgbt club, hugged me when I'm crying. 

He's had girlfriends, and yes it makes me upset a bit, but I'm also incredibly happy for him. I always give advice to benefit him and try to help him find girlfriends. But I understand he's straight. Has never stopped how he acts and treats me. His girlfriends usually just call me his boyfriend and laugh about us. 

I talk to both these people daily and see them a few times a week. 

I read on the main page yesterday about a guy who walked in on his girlfriend crying because she found out her ex was getting married. 

Everyone was pretty harsh about how she's kind of an ass for it and he might want to leave her. 

It made me scared I am too when I meet someone to be romantic with. 

I'd want to feel they are #1 or I wont be happy. But it'll be hard to find someone with these friends in my life. And I'll never want to give them up or love them less. I feel really guilty that this male friend of mine I find extremely attractive. Even if I found a partner I'd still want to talk to these people and have them the same in my life. 

I have other really close friends too but these two just are special. I tend to crush on any friend that I'm close with. I've just learnt to deal with it but always felt like I'm doing something shady by keeping said friends.
