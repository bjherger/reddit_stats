However I feel uncomfortable talking about anything gay related in a group setting.  I can talk about hot guys and other stuff when I'm with certain people, but even then I'm sometimes not comfortable.  I don't know why.

I've known I was gay since I was 15/16 and have accepted it internally.  But I still find myself struggling to come out, even though I am out. Over the last 3-4 years I've told my parents, siblings and friends. I've never had a bad response.

However, I feel uncomfortable if something gayish comes up. Most of my friends are guys who go out to the bars drinking and hooking up with girls.  A lot of the conversations we have as a group are about girls and what have you. So when something gay related comes up in conversation or on TV with them, I just kind of shut down.  I'm the only one who relates and I feel as though everyone is thinking about me or looking at me because I'm the only gay one in the friend group.

I live in a small town and I have no gay friends nor have I had any relationships or sexual experiences.  I'm a pretty well rounded individual, I think I'm quite looking, athletic, masculine (although that doesn't matter, just painting a picture), wealthy, and am pretty in touch with reality and my feelings, which is why I'm struggling to understand this.

I decided to ask for some advice/insight after my roommate told a mutual friend that I'm gay.  I've known him for 3 years and they just met.  I've never told him, but it's kind of easy to tell after knowing someone for 3 years.  He said that he's always assumed but has never known.  He than asked her if I was out and she said well I think if you asked him he would tell you.

It kind of bothered me that she was just non-nonchalantly telling people I was gay without asking me.  But then again, who cares and why should I?  I should be out and proud, I'm pretty well known around town and should be a role model for other gay people.  But alas, I feel this way and need help understanding why and how to overcome it.

Last wednesday Tony flew back home to Oregon, and that same night he told his wife everything. He told her that there's a guy he has been seeing since high school (me, but kept me anonymous) and that he was coming back to our college town to hang out / hook up with me monthly. He told her that he's pretty sure that his feelings for me are very real and that he's not sure he should continue the marriage. 

Guess what? **She didn't completely freak the fuck out.** She was actually.... very understanding [?] of the situation and suggested that he take some time to sort his feelings out. She also suggested that they do at least a few counseling sessions to work through it. They also agreed that if a split-up does occur to split any assets 50/50. Since they haven't been married long there really aren't many assets to deal with anyway, just a couple cars and a joint bank account. They are also both doing very well in their careers so money is not an issue here for anyone.

About the baby, they both agreed to be equally supportive and custodial of the child and to love him all the same no matter what. Their lawyer has also drawn up the details of all of this as a just in case, just to be sure that things are handled fairly if they do end up splitting up. 

**Please note that I am still WTF-ing over here.** My brain is all like [i.imgur.com/NADifHN.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/NADifHN.jpg).

Tony still maintains that he would like it if we could pursue something serious down the road with me and I am seriously considering leaving the door open for that. After analyzing my own feelings about everything, I think I could love Tony and I am beginning to be attracted to the idea of actually dating and getting to know him on a more personal level since we've grown up. We spent a lot of time together when we were younger but less as we got older, maybe we could still hit it off well. I'm just going to keep an open mind about it with no expectations and see where things go. We agreed to not have sex during this time, but to still be able to hang out otherwise.

The question is... am I being fair or am I being stupid?

About two years ago, I attended the local community college for some spare credits.  There, I met a straight guy who we will call J.  J is an extremely attractive, older (to me), former soldier that I had some classes with.  We became friendly and I learned about some of his issues which I helped him with for a bit.  Struggling with coming out, I confessed to him that I was attracted to him.  He reiterated that he was straight but admitted to some less-than-heterosexual behavior while in Afghanistan as well as his great enjoyment of agressive anal stimulation.  These sexual conversations became common for a while.

Flash forward two years to recent months.  We've remained friendly since then and comment/message on facebook, but largely fell out of touch.  When I recently turned 22, he messaged me saying that now that I was an adult he would take me out for a night of drinking.  He said that he'll take care of me and insisted that I sleep at his place so I won't need to drive home.  

Flattered and happy as I am that this tiny buff tattooed god would take me out for drinks and have me crash at his place, it seems strange to me that a guy I hadn't spoken to for quite some time would out of the blue call a guy he knows is attracted to him and invite him/me out like that.

TL;DR Straight stud soldier that knows I'm hot for him invited me out for drinks and to stay at his place afterward even though we haven't seen each other in nearly 2 years.

I'm terrible at reading situations so what should I expect?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, some background:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About two years ago, I attended the local community college for some spare credits.  There, I met a straight guy who we will call J.  J is an extremely attractive, older (to me), former soldier that I had some classes with.  We became friendly and I learned about some of his issues which I helped him with for a bit.  Struggling with coming out, I confessed to him that I was attracted to him.  He reiterated that he was straight but admitted to some less-than-heterosexual behavior while in Afghanistan as well as his great enjoyment of agressive anal stimulation.  These sexual conversations became common for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
