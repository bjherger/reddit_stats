So I'm seeing this guy I think is really awesome.  He is super fun, and I really have a great time whenever around him.  He loves to dance, is a young professional like me, and has an infectious positive spirit that is really attractive to me.

We met on Tinder. At first, we were just friends.  But over the past two months, we have developed some more...tension between us.   I've started to like him, and he has said he really likes me too.  However, he is very uneasy about kissing or even showing any affection, because he ""wants to know when it's right"" before doing it.

He says he just ""wants to be friends"" right now. He doesn't want to hurt me, or me to hurt him if we jump into ""Dating"" or a ""relationship"" too soon.   And I respected and was cool with that, even though I liked him. But in the same sentence, he really likes me, texts me everyday, and I'm like the only boy he talks to. 

And at the same time,...whenever we're alone together at the end of the night, he comes on to me hard.  Touching me all over, getting very sexual.  It was cool at first, because it showed that he was into me.  But after the second or third time, I feel kinda...dirty doing it.  It's weird to me not showing affection all day - no kissing, barely any touching - then suddenly going ""all the way"".  It's kinda unfulfilling, sexually.  I've realized I really do like those little bits of affection, like kissing, touching, positive words, those kinds of things.

I've talked to him about it, and he says he is trying to show more affection, and that his previous relationship is leaving him guarded.  He says he will come around, and he has always has this problem of showing affection and it has hurt him before.  He asks me to have patience with him.  It is also good to mention that he is originally from Liberia, which is a very homophobic country.  So I think he still secretly holds some shame about his identity, even though he is out to his parents and his family, and they accept him for it.

So what do you think?  And have you been in this type of situation before?  Should I give it up, or look for someone else, just being the next person to hurt him?  I would hate to give up on someone so cool...  And why the hell am I even worrying, if we're just friends?  It's all so confusing.

Thanks for listening bros.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey bros.  So I&amp;#39;m seeing this guy I think is really awesome.

Anyways, I had no idea what his name was because he initially told me his name, but I heard people call him a couple variations of a different name. The other night he came over to my place, and wanted to hang out with my roommates.  When we were walking outside to where they were hanging, he whispered in my ear what he wanted me to introduce him as, but said it wasnt his real name.

I thought that was really weird. He even messed up and introduced himself by his real name and corrected himself.  I later asked him why he wanted to go by the alias, and he said he ""didn't want people to know his real name"".  He wouldn't explain it further.

Any idea whats up with this?  He is definitely out of the closet completely, and I am almost positive he is not in a monogamous relationship and cheating on them, because he does not try to hide that we hang out a ton (He posts non-explicit snapchats of us hanging out on my/his bed on his story).

TLDR of the story if you don't want to read them:
I like this guy and he's 18 years older than me, we met a few times and had a great time together (movie, dinner, walks and so on) and I decided to ask him about where is this going.

So as I said there, I would meet him and talk about it, but I couldn't ask him. Well, we had a great time anyway. Then we keep messaging each other and while I know he's busy, he'll reply whenever he's got time and those are not short 'yes and no' reply but he likes to troll me and stuff over those texts. Every time we meet, we always had a great time. Our conversation just flows naturally (he did college in a major related to what I'm doing right now).

Part of the reason why I don't want to ask where are we going with this, is because I don't want to lose such a great friend. I think I am lucky to meet such a person and he cares about his family and he's sweet to his friends as well. (He's definitely a boyfriend material, trust me). 

What made me like this guy more is because I think I did all the things that should offend him (or maybe block me forever like some guys I've contacted). I confessed that I stalk him A LOT and he was just like ""stalker! I know that"" and brushed it off. I did dramas to him, like one day he said he was going with someone that night and I was like ""enjoy your date"" and I sent some sad or crying emojis and he was like ""Oh gosh, drama."" but then when I texted him the next day he was cool about it. Also one day he just read my text and I sent him walls of texts which finally ends with ""okay, enjoy your night"" - I'll be annoyed if someone does this to me - again, he just said ""What a drama queen"" and the next day we talked like it was nothing.

Today we met as he wants to test his new device that he bought just then. We tested that we had a great time (read: reaaaaly good as it was super fun, never did I see him that happy before). Then we had dinner, talked a bit, joking around, and went separate ways. When we went our own ways I felt just like I need to ask him about that. I asked him whether he wants to meet up again later as I want to ask something and he said yes. 

While waiting for him to finish, I had a walk to a place where we first met and talked. I remember the things we've done there and I was telling myself, whatever the answer will be tonight I have to man up and face it no matter how hard it will be. A little bit later, he texted me and we agreed to meet in a cafe.

-----
So I met him. I didn't ask the question straight away as I was nervous, but then I did.
I asked him, *""Are we just friends?""*
*""Yes""*
(Then I went into shock mode for a minute and I can't remember exactly what we were talking about that moment, a little bit later when I settled down we had another conversation.)

Me: *""I just want to make sure you know, so I would know my limits.""*

Him: *""It's okay, you don't have to have limit yourself with me.""*

Me: *""So I also want to know about what do you think of me...""*

Him: *""Well, I like the fact that you are a bit geeky and ner..""* (I cut him, oh and his type is someone who's a bit geeky)

Me: *""..maybe like, things I need to improve and stuff.""*

Him: *""No, no there's nothing that you need to improve, I mean, if you are dating someone you don't have to change or improve anything, he will like you as you are so you don't have to worry about changing.""*

Him: *""You know, there's this guy I met (there was a day when we met and he was with this guy and I thought he was just his friend) and the part I like about him is he is smart and doing his PhD now, and he's a bit geeky too, but I just feel like I don't want to meet him anymore as he's a bit touchy with me the first time we met.""*

Me: *""Oh, okay, I see.""*

-----
Then there are some lines I shouldn't say as it was very specific. I guess I should tell you bros that I'm not out yet (only a few of my friends know).

Him: *""Do you have any gay friends?""*

Me: *""Yes, I do.""*

Him: *""So let's say you have a guy that wants to be your boyfriend, but he's telling you that you need to come out to people, what would you do?""*

Me: *""Is it to my family? If yes, I'd tell him that I'll be out to them after I graduate and I am independent.""*

Him: *""Of course it's a gradual thing..""* (I cut him again :p)

Me: *""But if they are my close friends, of course I will if they're like my close friends and they ask.. But I feel like I shouldn't announce it to people.""*

Him: *""Of course, it's don't ask, don't tell policy, right?""*

Me: *""Yeah, well, maybe some might be shocked and some might agree.""*

Him: *""Maybe they would support you, who knows?""*

-----
After this we continued our conversation, but I noticed that he did some things that he NEVER did in front of me. He began to do this back-and-forth motion with his hand like he was nervous, he didn't even look me in the eye (I think we always do when we talk normally) and he was sitting putting his leg up another chair as we talked.

Me: *""Stop making that distracting motion.""*

We continued talking. Long story short, we got up as both of us were sleepy and he told me not to jump and anything like that and he picked the tab. It was a bit awkward even though we did talk normally along the way. I teased him a bit and we went separate ways.

Finally, I gave him a text saying *""Thanks for coming""* and a 'bye' emoji.
He read it, but he did not reply.

Then I went to the station, putting my earphone on like I always do, played a song and went on a train. Then I waited for another hour for my bus home, walking around, thinking about what just happened. I am surprised with myself that I didn't cry even though a mellow song was playing.

So that was my story bros, thank you for reading.
To be honest, I am glad I did the talk. I feel relieved now.

What do you bros think? Thanks for reading.

*sorry for my English tho.*

**TL,DR** : I like an older guy (he knows about this) and I asked him whether we're just friends and he said yes. We had some odd conversation afterwards and I noticed he seemed a bit nervous at that time. Then I said bye to him, oddly, I didn't feel sad nor did I cry at all.
","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Bros, so I posted &lt;a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/29gvlg/im_a_bit_unsure_about_this_guy_older_btw/""&gt;this story&lt;/a&gt; before and I am thankful because some of you gave me great feedbacks and inputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR of the story if you don&amp;#39;t want to read them:

Okay so first things first, this is a throwaway. Anyway this is a bit of a read, so bear with me: 

I'm a 19 year old closeted gay boy. I was born and raised in America but my parents emigrated from India in 1989, so culturally I'm a very confused amalgamation with a penchant for spicy food (think the folks at r/ABCDesis). 

Anyway, like any of us, I've been thinking about coming out. My problem is that culturally I've found a lot of Indians to be either homophobic or just plain ignorant. We're talking about my parents overt homophobia, some of my extended families ignorance, our family friends making derogatory comments about a lesbian couple at a restaurant, and even some of my dad's business associates saying ""No good Indian parents would let their child choose to be gay."" Now obviously this doesn't apply to everyone I know, but it does apply to most of them. 

So my question is to you, denizens of AskGaybros, who are from similar culturally conservative backgrounds. What is/are your experiences? What--if any--advice do you have for me? Thanks a bunch! 

Side note: I don't plan on coming out till I'm financially independent and I have told my sister, who is totally okay with it, but agrees that financial independence is the best time to do it.

I am a long rime lurker who just decided to get some advice on what I know is a common problem with gay dudes, so here it is:

I am a 21 year old gay dude who has a crush on his straight best friend who has a girlfriend. It has been two years since we've known each other from school and he knew that I was gay almost from day one. We have always spent a lot of time together since he is one of my only male friends and we have a lot of things in common, like our love for tv shows, sci-fi and weed.

The thing is that few months ago we were drunk and he told me he thought that he was gay because of all the things he has in common with me and other gay friends we have, which totally made my hopes go up, however it was just a comment he made and never really mentioned it again. He also has asked me a lot of questions regarding gay sex (which I admit I don't really have a lot of experience on).

As I mentioned before, he has a girlfriend, with whom he has a long distance relationship, and I've had a lot of opportunities to make advancements on him since we sleep together a lot, however: I am a fucking pussy and won't do anything. We sometimes end up sleeping really close to each other (which leaves me fucking horny whenever it happens!) but I'm too scared to make any advancements because of my fear rejection, not because of being rejected per se, but because it could hurt our friendship or, on the other hand, if he responds back I don't want him to be confused about his sexuality and have him not talk to me and cheat on his girlfriend (who I don't personally know). Also, telling him how I feel is not an option beacuse pussy.

This crush I got on him is something that is completely tearing me apart: I get depressed whenever he's not around, I try to read into every interaction we have (any text, anything he tells me, whenever he hugs me, etc.), I cannot think of anything else but him, and I have little interest on other people's lives but him. I have already tried to avoid him, I even spent the worst month of my life not talking to him at all to see if I could somehow forget him but it was awful for the reasons I listed above and just ran to see him again at the first oportunity.

Which brings me to a second problem: I did try to meet other people and used Grindr and Scruff for that but (and no offense to anyone who uses Grindr) I was left with the impression that every guy in there is pretty much what I hate about the gay community: they are shallow and only think about sex. Also, going to a gay bar is not an option since I do not enjoy the music (sorry, music is the most important thing for bar enjoyment imo). This is bad because those are the only ways that I can think about meeting new people on town to forget about him.

So gaybros, I guess I'm not seeking advice as much as I'm seeking to share my problem,  if you guys have any input on the situation it will be very welcome whatever it is. I am very self conscious about what I do, say or think so believe me when I tell you I have been analyzing the situation on my head forever, my emotions are the problem in this case.
I'm sorry if the post is not clear enough, my head is pretty much a mess, I haven't really talked about this to anyone but the people who will read this post and English is not my native language so sorry if the sentences do not make a lot of sense.

I now really want to hook up with a hot guy.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m pretty sure I&amp;#39;m bi, and I&amp;#39;ve never done anything sexual with a guy.  I&amp;#39;ve been having trouble sleeping recently and started taking melatonin.  It works well but has been giving me really vidid dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
