I'm a bisexual male with little dating experience when it comes to guys. But when I'm talking/chatting to a guy I never know how far I can go when it comes to flirting. Especially in public and because I'm attracted to ~~actual guys~~ more masculine guys (who act predominantly straight) and not the really queer type.

For instance: Right now I'm chatting with a guy of which his profile says:  ""Open minded"". So I don't know how to type? Should I use smiley's or an 'x' after messages or what?.

I don't expect you guys to give me a direct answer, but I was hoping you could help me finding out the answer.

There are two guys that I think about all the time, both of them are good friends and both know I'm not sure about my sexuality. One is a straight bro that I'm super into and I can't get over. I sort of came out to him just so he knows where to go if he ever wants to experiment... haha I know I have a problem. The other guy is actually gay and decently attractive but I'm just not interested in starting a relationship with him and he's made it very clear he wants to date me.

My question is really how do I get over my straight bro? I always wonder if he's bi too, but maybe that’s just me being hopeful. And for the gay one, we spent two nights making out but I've told him I feel like I’m leading him on since I know what his end game is and I know I won't want a relationship with him down the road (I told him I’m not looking for a relationship, didn’t want to be mean and say with him). I think my problem is I tend to get hopelessly attracted to my straight friends and can’t see myself being with someone that’s clearly openly gay.

Hot men in skimpy clothes everywhere, lots of gay couples, etc. Being away from everyone too I made it a requirement I hit up some gay bars there. The bars were awesome, but my first night was very depressing toward the end, because only one guy talked to me and I was not attracted to him at all (and he was older). The second night was more fun because I was leaving the next day so I basically said I wouldn't hook up or do anything with anyone anyway since I was leaving so it took off some of the pressure or expectations from me. Most people did not talk to me (although I didn't initiate either), but a creepy guy from paris was all touchy and sorta got the hint I didn't want to talk to him, but he would swing by every now and then and touch me again and whatever. **So, I guess, how do you all deal with people you don't have an interest in from talking to you at bars and clubs? I feel horrible just asking that because I would feel bad on the other end, but at the same time both of us are wasting out time. I don't want to just ignore them (unless I have to) because it feels so cruel, but when I'm smiling and answering their questions it seems to give them the impression I am interested.**

Oh and if you care about the rest of my second night at the bar, toward the end a guy talked to me and I let him since he was someone to talk to and wasn't unattractive or anything, but just not really my type. But we talked a bit and we made out, which was my first time ever making out with a guy (ugh fml), and then we got pretty touchy haha. Feeling a guy through his pants is like the best. I feel bad, though because I think my general horniness sort of started it and lead him on and then I went home afterward without him lol. I did tell him several times that I would be leaving soon because I had to get up early, but that didn't stop his begging haha. 

Oh well, I'm sure he found someone else...maybe. I'm happy for the experience and trying to not think too much about the fact that i wasn't 100% attracted to him (nor would I want to hook up with him) and that he was the only one again that talked to me aside from the other two I didn't care about. I'm just very shy and just smiling randomly feels weird, so I think I just come off as not interested to everyone, but idk.I have to work on that. I also think I'm really bad at reading signs because a guy on the first night asked me what time it was and mentioned how ""it's still early"" to me and I sort of didn't really continue engaging, but he wasn't bad and I didn't really realize until later when I saw him walking around alone a lot that he might have been actually wanting a conversation lol. And then there was another guy who was just standing alone next to me for like 5 minutes or so and then got up and left. I don't know if he was maybe waiting for me to express interest of if he was just hanging out there. 

Oh, and wtf, everyone in Miami smokes. I have to say that's pretty gross and I came home from the bar smelling of smoke.

All in all, at least entering a gay bar isn't this horrible mountain to climb anymore and I definitely need to get out there and meet people, so I'm going to start going to the gay bars here in cbus, which I think are actually pretty good. A big issue is driving since I live like 30 minutes away from where they are, but I guess I just can't rely on liquid courage.

Basically, I'm 19, gay, my parents don't know, and I'm now in a relationship with my first and only boyfriend of 4+ months. I've gone a little far away for college (same state, just a long drive), and I've been back for about two weeks. Since I don't have anything to do here in my hometown, I'll be going back to stay with my boyfriend. I was thinking it would be for the best if I came out before I do. I was planning to keep it a secret for a lot longer, perhaps until I'm 22. Unfortunately, I have to have oral surgery in a month or two, and I'm really uneasy about it. I'd like my boyfriend to be able to be there through that process; it would make the whole thing a lot easier on me with his support. Not to mention that I might accidentally come out under all the narcotics, and, since I won't remember a thing, I don't want that to be the way I come out to my parents.


Here's the problem: my mother insists that the surgery is done near home. She won't allow me to get the surgery done with any of the other very capable surgeons near where I'll be staying (one of my friends' mother works in dentistry and likely knows a good surgeon or two). I'm the only child, so she feels that there is absolutely no other way. That being said, if I don't tell her I'm gay and in a relationship, I'd have no real way of being able to see my boyfriend for however long this might take, not to mention I don't know how long she'll want to keep me in town before/after. I'd miss him very much, on top of having to hide him AND keep my nerves together over this surgery.

Coming out has always been a scary thought for me, but ever since my boyfriend told his family a few days ago, I've felt a little more confident about it. His family took it well, even his stepfather. I have a feeling my mother will be pretty supportive about it, as she's made some comments to that effect over the years. My dad, on the other hand, I'm not so sure about. I'm his only son, and he doesn't have any family left on his side, so I can't imagine he'd disown me. Coming out would just be so unbelievably awkward for both of us - he's one of those old-fashioned guys that have a mindset of twice their age. I've heard a lot of homophobic comments from him in the last few years, and on one occasion he teased me for taking an ally position on something in the news. He thinks homosexuality is quite simply unnatural. Both of my parents are Christian, although they aren't extremely radical and confrontational like most other Christians I've met. They know I'm an atheist, and they don't give me much BS for it, which is good. However, it seems to me that both of them have tried to deny/forget the whole atheist thing, and just wrote it off as a ""phase,"" like most parents think it's okay to do. I don't know if this would tie into what they might do if I come out. Every chance my dad gets, he asks me about girls. As a gay guy, this pisses me off every time. I know I need to cover myself up and not get upset, but still, it's always annoying. It makes me not want to talk to my dad so that I'm never approached with this question. I *always* blow the question off with some kind of roundabout answer, and I've done that for a very long while now; admittedly, I *still* did this before I even figured out that I was gay - I just knew girls weren't really my thing. For all I know, after all these years, they might think I'm asexual. This question has *always* annoyed me over the years, and I don't really think it's reasonable for him to be blind of that. Despite this, he takes an especially heteronormative and closed-minded stance that, I'm male, so therefore I must be in pursuit of a female. Period. That's how it works. He'll keep asking me regardless, which I suspect means he's in denial.

I'm not so worried that I'll be disowned or anything like that, I just don't want to be treated differently/weirdly. I can expect the awkward questions in the first few days, but this might come as a shock to them. I don't want there to be an awkward vibe every time I come home from college for a week or two here and there - I want to come out so that my (now distant) relationship with my parents is stronger, not weaker. Not only that, but because of my surgery, I'm going to need both of them to be comfortable with having my boyfriend at home. If I can't feel confident that they *won't* be all awkward about it when he's here, then I don't know how I'll be able compel myself to come out. Realistically, me coming out is centered mostly around being with my boyfriend for the surgery; I want that more than anything in the world right now. On the other hand, I also feel that I can't keep this a secret forever, and it would be a horrible mistake to do so. Something is telling me this is a prime time to get it over with, and I'd certainly regret missing this as a possible opportunity. It's just difficult having parents that are really overbearing - I haven't gotten into most of that here, but they really overdo the whole parenting thing. I'm an only child, and they drive me up a wall. At 19, they shouldn't be so overprotective, and shouldn't treat me like I'm 12. Being so overprotective makes them very unapproachable, as they always make a mountain out of an anthill, and blow everything I ever go to them with out of proportions to the point where I don't even like talking to them anymore. It's like picking up my cat that hates being smothered - eventually she'll try to wriggle free and go run and hide.

I haven't even considered the rest of my family into this, either. It's just a really weird thought.

I've already tried telling my mother quite a few times. I just can't make the words come out.
Any advice?

TL;DR - Gay, have boyfriend, overbearing parents don't know and think I am perpetually single, feel the need to come out, afraid of everything being suddenly awkward, don't want to feel weird coming home, need advice.

She won&amp;#39;t allow me to get the surgery done with any of the other very capable surgeons near where I&amp;#39;ll be staying (one of my friends&amp;#39; mother works in dentistry and likely knows a good surgeon or two). I&amp;#39;m the only child, so she feels that there is absolutely no other way. That being said, if I don&amp;#39;t tell her I&amp;#39;m gay and in a relationship, I&amp;#39;d have no real way of being able to see my boyfriend for however long this might take, not to mention I don&amp;#39;t know how long she&amp;#39;ll want to keep me in town before/after. I&amp;#39;d miss him very much, on top of having to hide him AND keep my nerves together over this surgery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming out has always been a scary thought for me, but ever since my boyfriend told his family a few days ago, I&amp;#39;ve felt a little more confident about it. His family took it well, even his stepfather. I have a feeling my mother will be pretty supportive about it, as she&amp;#39;s made some comments to that effect over the years. My dad, on the other hand, I&amp;#39;m not so sure about. I&amp;#39;m his only son, and he doesn&amp;#39;t have any family left on his side, so I can&amp;#39;t imagine he&amp;#39;d disown me. Coming out would just be so unbelievably awkward for both of us - he&amp;#39;s one of those old-fashioned guys that have a mindset of twice their age. I&amp;#39;ve heard a lot of homophobic comments from him in the last few years, and on one occasion he teased me for taking an ally position on something in the news. He thinks homosexuality is quite simply unnatural. Both of my parents are Christian, although they aren&amp;#39;t extremely radical and confrontational like most other Christians I&amp;#39;ve met. They know I&amp;#39;m an atheist, and they don&amp;#39;t give me much BS for it, which is good. However, it seems to me that both of them have tried to deny/forget the whole atheist thing, and just wrote it off as a &amp;quot;phase,&amp;quot; like most parents think it&amp;#39;s okay to do. I don&amp;#39;t know if this would tie into what they might do if I come out. Every chance my dad gets, he asks me about girls. As a gay guy, this pisses me off every time. I know I need to cover myself up and not get upset, but still, it&amp;#39;s always annoying. It makes me not want to talk to my dad so that I&amp;#39;m never approached with this question. I &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; blow the question off with some kind of roundabout answer, and I&amp;#39;ve done that for a very long while now; admittedly, I &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; did this before I even figured out that I was gay - I just knew girls weren&amp;#39;t really my thing. For all I know, after all these years, they might think I&amp;#39;m asexual. This question has &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; annoyed me over the years, and I don&amp;#39;t really think it&amp;#39;s reasonable for him to be blind of that. Despite this, he takes an especially heteronormative and closed-minded stance that, I&amp;#39;m male, so therefore I must be in pursuit of a female. Period. That&amp;#39;s how it works. He&amp;#39;ll keep asking me regardless, which I suspect means he&amp;#39;s in denial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not so worried that I&amp;#39;ll be disowned or anything like that, I just don&amp;#39;t want to be treated differently/weirdly. I can expect the awkward questions in the first few days, but this might come as a shock to them. I don&amp;#39;t want there to be an awkward vibe every time I come home from college for a week or two here and there - I want to come out so that my (now distant) relationship with my parents is stronger, not weaker. Not only that, but because of my surgery, I&amp;#39;m going to need both of them to be comfortable with having my boyfriend at home. If I can&amp;#39;t feel confident that they &lt;em&gt;won&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt; be all awkward about it when he&amp;#39;s here, then I don&amp;#39;t know how I&amp;#39;ll be able compel myself to come out. Realistically, me coming out is centered mostly around being with my boyfriend for the surgery; I want that more than anything in the world right now. On the other hand, I also feel that I can&amp;#39;t keep this a secret forever, and it would be a horrible mistake to do so. Something is telling me this is a prime time to get it over with, and I&amp;#39;d certainly regret missing this as a possible opportunity. It&amp;#39;s just difficult having parents that are really overbearing - I haven&amp;#39;t gotten into most of that here, but they really overdo the whole parenting thing. I&amp;#39;m an only child, and they drive me up a wall. At 19, they shouldn&amp;#39;t be so overprotective, and shouldn&amp;#39;t treat me like I&amp;#39;m 12. Being so overprotective makes them very unapproachable, as they always make a mountain out of an anthill, and blow everything I ever go to them with out of proportions to the point where I don&amp;#39;t even like talking to them anymore. It&amp;#39;s like picking up my cat that hates being smothered - eventually she&amp;#39;ll try to wriggle free and go run and hide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t even considered the rest of my family into this, either. It&amp;#39;s just a really weird thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve already tried telling my mother quite a few times. I just can&amp;#39;t make the words come out.
Any advice?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR - Gay, have boyfriend, overbearing parents don&amp;#39;t know and think I am perpetually single, feel the need to come out, afraid of everything being suddenly awkward, don&amp;#39;t want to feel weird coming home, need advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you all for your support.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm fully out, not ashamed of being gay, etc. I've gone on dates, I have friends I can hangout with (not as many as before), I've had various short term relationships, been working in corporate america for years, about to finish paying off my debts, make a lot of money, and at the end of the day I'm kind of confused as to what's next.

Personally, I'd love to have found at least a boyfriend, but that probably wouldn't change anything within myself because I kind of just don't want to be in corporate america anymore. I'd love to have a family and the like, but again it probably wouldn't change any aspect of my life. Recently, I'm being forced to work on something that isn't my expertise and I've fully acknowledged it to everyone. My coworker who has the skill set to take care of this task is leaving, so their trying to get me up to speed to his knowledge even though I truly suck at it. I'm being honest and recognize my strength isn't in this area. I know this is a growth opportunity, but at the end of the day I feel like just saying so what.

I feel like saying so what to everything. The thought of what happens when I pay my debt off and what I'm supposed to do afterwards is sort of blank. I don't see anything happening afterwards. I see myself in a cube till I'm old and being bitter about it. I really enjoyed a simpler life I once had where I only worked four days a week, but I'm truly not passionate of what I do. I like what I do and I truly see it to provide a means to an end in regards to my debt.

I've gotten myself out of the ghetto, into an office job, I have a car. I have all of these things and I realize they truly mean squat diddly. The sucky part is that I currently provide $200 a month to my mother. She doesn't need it, but she appreciates it (she doesn't work and is on disability). My siblings and I have taken care of paying for the family house. I don't have any responsibilities outside of that.

These thoughts piss me off because I feel like I should be more grateful about it and realize I am truly in no position to just not work until I'm old.

I have friends who have been playing life by ear and things work out. 

My true passions are 1) Traveling 2) Writing 3) Music. I'm not lazy about these things because I try to travel as much as I can, I'm writing a screenplay and a separate book, and I write music all the time. I'll be honest and say I'm am 100% lazy about everything else to this point. Finding a partner and work mainly. Nowadays, my time on the weekend's is spent outdoors, hiking, reading a book, and just being there in that moment. It's not happiness, but it's also not fear, anger, frustration, etc.

I'd definitely consult a psychologist before I decide anything, but I just needed to get this off my chest. I'm trying to find my happiness and right now, I have no clue what that is or would look like. I'm also starting to realize the corporate america McMansion dream isn't really for me, even thought deep down inside it's something I've been striving for.

On my way home I sent a simple text to him saying that I had a great time with him this weekend and that I
Hope he has a great day at work. He immediately responded.

I was wondering if any of you had some tips about properly stimulating the prostate consistently. I understand there are a lot of factors that go into this: penis shape (mine's pretty damn straight), position, what the bottom himself likes, but I'd like to hear any sort of advice you fellas have to offer!

I'm a completely vers guy, but have bottomed for most of the guys I've been with. I'm finally with someone who's as versatile as me, so I'd love to hit that right spot as well as possible as quickly as possible. Thanks!!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi guys,&lt;/p&gt;

It's actually really embarrassing it took me so long to realize it. I think I've been repressing my feelings for the last decade, because I desperately wanted a ""normal"" life. But now I understand that I really just want to be happy, even if that means being with a guy. I've always wanted to date, but it never seemed to work out with girls. It's actually kind of liberating now understanding why, and hoping in the future I can have a real relationship.

I was reading older posts here, and one comment that stood out to me was a poster giving advice to a dad of a gay son. He said something along the lines of ""it's better to come to terms with it at 13 than wait until you're older and still be an adult with the experience of a 13 year old"". And I realized that's me. It's frustrating, and I'm sure it's going to be difficult, and I'm really just looking for advice. Has anyone here been in a similar situation? 

I've hooked up with girls in the past, though I was never really into it (hmmm, I wonder why?). I have really have no idea where to start. I want to ""experience"" it first before telling any friends or family, which will be a whole other issue. Any thoughts? Thanks in advance!
