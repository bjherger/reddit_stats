Been following this subreddit for the past 10 or so months, but havent been bothered to create an account of my own, but now its time. Im struggling right now, and have seen how you guys have helped each other out in the past, including myself from reading it all. So this is a New to gaybros/coming out/letting of some steam post. I hope i dont break of the posting rules.

My question to you all are; How did you get through a really rough time in your life? Any advices for younger bro on how to make it through to the bright side?
I need some help to cope right now. Finished high school in june -14, and now i just feel lost and helpless. Been long distance dating (Sweden - UK) an amazing guy for 9 months now which is amazing but since i returned from the UK last time ive just been restless and anxious. Im stuck with a night time job in a field i dont really want, about to move into an apartment that is a quite expensive, in a city where i feel quite alone since almost all my classmates moved after school. Dont have time to work out, or meet the few people i know. All i want is to move over, or to travel/do something fun in my life.

I dont talk to my family anymore, since they're not really happy about me dating a guy, even though they met him before they knew we were dating, and really liked him. I told them a few days after he had left, and i was still visiting them. Nothing i had planned on doing, but i just felt like i couldnt keep it in anymore. I sat down at the table, and was like; ""There is something i have to tell you. Me and X are not just friends, we are actually dating since a few months back."" The reaction wasnt really positive, which i was prepared for but at least Im still welcome home - unless i have my BF with me. They have made it very clear that they are not supporting this in any way, and that they will not give me any money, or lend me any money to help me afford seeing him. Their main worry is that someone in church, or in the village will find out. What will they say, how will we be treated, what will your sisters friend say to her? Mom texts me sporadically, and sometimes tries to call. I try to avoid talking to them as much as possible though. Mom and my sister just cries, dad is trying to tell me how hes not happy about it in a really passively agressive way, and i know talking to them just makes me sad, annoyed, and feeling alone. Missed my sisters 18th birthday, and her getting her drivers licence. I feel shit about it!

I dont know what i want to do with my life, and i feel like im just wasting the years in my life when im meant to be young, happy, and do crazy stuff.

FIRST: I was in a relationship with a woman for about 7 years. I was never able to enjoy oral sex, or handjobs. I always attributed it as a preference, but I would really hope to enjoy it. So my question is. Any bros out there had a similar experience? I hope its the fact that I just didn't get the right type of stimulation since it was a woman. Though I was able to have regular intercourse.

Second: Is this whole top/bottom submissive/dominant thing like super important? In my head I think I'm more attracted to just enjoying a sharing a sexual experience equally. Is that a problem for most guys or is there a sufficient base of people that feel this way. I just don't want to find a hard time with this whole defined roles thing.

So here's the story: In about a month, just like every other college senior out there right now, I'll be graduating with my Bachelor's degree. I'm way behind the 8-ball in terms of the job search and I have perhaps the most unclear idea of what I want from my life post-graduation. 

I know that eventually I want to go to Graduate school so originally I was planning on taking a gap year to figure that out and work. The more that I personally reflect though, I realize that for me the gap year is more of a chance to see if I can find a full-time job that I like enough so that I can either put grad school off for a couple more years until I get on my own two feet or decide that I can make a satisfying living without going to grad school. 

Either way, I know that I want to use this period of my life which is so unplanned and available to get away, get out there, and find myself. I've lived in the center of the Midwest for nearly my entire life and if I'm being honest, my heart yearns to live somewhere where I feel unconstrained. I really hope to use my search for a job as a stepping stone to finding that place. 

So I've got a couple of questions for you guys: First of all, what are your guys' best tips when searching for a full-time, entry level position and secondly, where are some of the most gay-friendly, stimulating places that I should be including in my job search? Seriously, I'm not even sure what tools or sites to start using when looking for a job so even the most basic, baby's-first-step advice is appreciate. :)

Or ask some advice I suppose. 

I'm just not interested in sex. I'm 23 years old, I've had many sexual partners and tried many *many* different things. I've tried topping and bottoming, neither of which are fun for me at all. I like sucking dick alright but I've never been able to cum from receiving oral sex. I've tried almost every kinky fetish you can think of and still, I just... don't like sex that much. It's more of a chore than a pleasure. I'd rather jerk off 1000% of the time, and even that only happens occasionally. I *know* that I'm gay, because, well, I've always known that. I find men very attractive, and get sexually aroused by them, but when it comes to doing the sex I'd rather do almost anything else. I've dated two men and my lack of sexual drive was a huge turnoff to both of them, they both accused me of cheating on them since I'd never really care to have sex, and I'd try to explain that I just don't care about sex only to be met with ""at your age? please!"" (they were both in their thirties) and it just always seems to create a problem.

I am (or at least I feel) very ready to just settle down with someone. That's all I want, is to just be able to come home after working 8-10 hour days and relax with my best friend and our dog, maybe cuddle up to a movie and have dinner, then go to bed and cuddle and that's it. And it just really bums me out because (especially in the gay community) sex is such a major thing, and I feel like I'm the only person who is like this. It's made me very depressed this past year and brought me to the brink of doing something stupid a couple times, but thankfully I have a great group of friends who have always been there to help and support me. It's just really really hard, going to sleep every night and just wanting someone to lay with and talk to, it makes me cry a lot because I just feel like it's going to always be this way.

I was on register and we kept giving each other the whole ""I think you're cute"" look. I built up the courage and asked him if I could sit while I was on my break. We talked and exchanged numbers. So...he asked me out and we hung out. Getting to know each other. Funny enough, we brought up interests and other stuff. Music, shows, etc. He was kinda a quintessential gay type from where I'm from (Miami). Talking about how much he loves ""Queen Bey""'s music and mentioned he watches Drag Race. But I saw other qualities I liked. He liked gaming and was pretty active. So when I pretty much admitted I don't care for pop music and was more interested in following college football than some drag show he seemed a bit annoyed. ""Oh you're one of 'those gays'. You're pretty much not really even gay"". I felt a bit shocked. So because I don't go clubbing and don't really care about pop culture I'm somehow ""less gay""? It really turned me off. :/

anyone have a similar experience? ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So a couple of days ago I met a guy while I was working. I was on register and we kept giving each other the whole &amp;quot;I think you&amp;#39;re cute&amp;quot; look. I built up the courage and asked him if I could sit while I was on my break. We talked and exchanged numbers. So...he asked me out and we hung out. Getting to know each other. Funny enough, we brought up interests and other stuff. Music, shows, etc. He was kinda a quintessential gay type from where I&amp;#39;m from (Miami). Talking about how much he loves &amp;quot;Queen Bey&amp;quot;&amp;#39;s music and mentioned he watches Drag Race. But I saw other qualities I liked. He liked gaming and was pretty active. So when I pretty much admitted I don&amp;#39;t care for pop music and was more interested in following college football than some drag show he seemed a bit annoyed. &amp;quot;Oh you&amp;#39;re one of &amp;#39;those gays&amp;#39;.

I try my best to stick to logic - still of course I am an emotional person. Also, it takes me a while to listen to my instincts, yet somehow, they manage to guide me, for better or worse. Like many, I've made mistakes.

Anyway, I wanted to give an update on my relationship (note that I've posted twice, [one under this account](http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/2zbshf/am_i_a_younger_version_of_a_sugar_daddy/) and [another under my 'other' account](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2y87kp/am_i_28_m_being_coldhearted_and_harsh_with/) - I don't know if it's normal to have 2 accounts?). 

So my partner finally did manage to line up a couple of small-time gigs that are getting him some money - he is working rather hard, almost 6 days a week and up to 12 hours! So that's great. He is happy and energetic but also a bit tired because he wants to work in his field (he cannot until he gets work authorization). We agreed once he makes up to a $1,000, he can start contributing financially. He is being quite well paid. Which is great news, really.

I found a job and will start soon. I am taking a pay cut for work that I've done in my previous position but I really cannot complain. I'm just happy and grateful that I will work soon!

I don't want to be one of those people who are never content and never happy (and maybe I am becoming one of those people). But I just am not feeling it. I don't feel that things on a personal level have improved between us. Although I feel I've become a lot calmer and more chill. It's worth mentioning that now I am doing all house duties - and it made me realize two things:

A) That this is really easy. I've done so much today so far and can do far more!

B) I feel like he is purposefully not doing anything and creating more mess for me to clean up. I could be paranoid but I am beginning to sense a bit of vengefulness. This could all be in my head and maybe I need to change my perception?


I feel generally that things have improved, which is great. I feel more relieved, more at peace, more calm, etc. Hence I will not take any action and instead will just observe. I want to sort reach a level where I am a bystander in my own relationship and become totally objective. To just take it one day at a time...

My guy (cannot call him my boyfriend yet I guess.) and I, we are both 20 yrs old,  have known each other for a month now. We met at PlanetRomeo (which is REALLY weird I know..I gave one last chance to that ""hooker"" site...and a miracle happened), and he is everything I have ever wanted, looks, personality...really everything. We had many meetings, romantic dinner, walks, picnic, museum, movie night, sleepover (without any sexy time), sleepover (with sexy time) and so on. I think we are over the get-to-know phase but of course I don't think we need to ""declare"" or ""officiate"" our relationships, we just click so well...we both know that. We are alike in a lot of things, but in one thing we are VERY different. I am very fast in attaching to people, developing feelings, he on the other hand is not, and he has hard time talking about feelings. He is more of a physical type..at least that is what he shows himself to be, I have doubts about that cause he seems to be an emotional person as well, just, as I have mentioned, he is still a bit afraid of showing them I guess.

Anyway, my problem is that in my whole gay life, my relationships never worked because of one thing. I was never into the naked time. I always felt it...porn-ish. I did no feel intimate when we were naked. I like sweet things, small things, kisses, even petting. but nakedness...I have tried almost everything, never had anal sex tho because I was...I guess I still am...afraid of it a little bit and looking for the right person.

So this evening I went out on a date with a guy that I'd met on tinder. We'd been talking for about a week and had planned to go out this Saturday but the other day he text me saying that he double booked and wanted to reschedule so we decided on this evening. Met him at the restaurant at the time we agreed on and he greeted me with a hug. We then got seated at our table and ordered our drinks and our food, and proceeded to get to know one another. When the bill came he offered to pay for the entire meal, I then tried to offer to pay but he wouldn't let me but then it tuned out that he was short a couple pounds so I paid for the rest. 

Then we left the restaurant and he said something about needing to get home so I offered to drive him home. (at this point I assumed he wasn't into me as he was wanting to go so soon) 

So we pull up outside his place and say our goodbyes and then out of nowhere he full on kisses me and we're not talking a pack on the cheek. This took me completely by surprise as I was sure he wasn't into me. He then said that he'd love to go out again and he'd speak to me sometime soon. 

I guess this entire evening has left me feeling confused as he seemed like the perfect gentleman but the whole thing was over within less than 2 hours. Is this normal for a first date?

1. I tend to lose my erection whenever I put a condom on. Or I can only keep it for like a minute or two before I get soft again. I've tried different condoms. I've tried masturbating with condoms, but I'm just having trouble getting used to it. I think part of it is that I tend to be pretty sensitive and get off pretty easily to slight touches. But when I put a condom on, I don't feel anything. (I'm very average, so I don't think it's a size issue.) Probably just due to what I'm used to feeling. Would a cock ring help?

2. I have trouble getting it in. I'm sure I'll get better with experience, and the guy I'm seeing now is great at communicating which is fucking awesome. But just in the moment, I feel like I can't enjoy myself because I'm just so focused on the mechanics of it. Trying to stay hard. I feel awkward, like I can't really take control or get into it.

I'm 23, and have been out for less than a year. I finally gathered the confidence to try OKC a few months ago. Went on a few dates that didn't go anywhere. Struggled to find anyone I was that into and was just about ready to give up for a while, when suddenly ""G"" likes me. 

He's super handsome and more importantly seems like a great match personality-wise so I like him back and start a conversation. We hit it off, chat over the weekend, and start texting daily. We go on a drunken/stoned whirlwind of a date the following weekend and have a great time (from what we can each remember lol). The texting continues and gets quite flirty, and we go on another date the following Thursday (last night). We smoke but stay much more sober this time, and still make good conversation and have a really enjoyable night. We've had nothing but a couple of warm hugs at this point, but I like this guy a lot--really the first time I've felt this way about anyone. G also tipsily admitted over text that he had a crush on me a couple nights ago, which totally made me smile. I responded honestly, telling him the same.

Here's the rub: At dinner last night G casually mentioned a couple exes, Grindr, Scruff, gay bars, etc. Which are obviously totally cool, normal conversation topics. He didn't ask me anything about that stuff directly so all I really said is I never went the app route and only tried OKC. Otherwise I kinda clammed up, and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since. I've never hooked up, never been to a gay bar, never had a relationship (other than an extremely awkward two weeks with a female friend years ago), and haven't even done so much as hold a guy's hand, at 23 years old. Whereas G clearly has been out a lot longer and has had a lot more experience, being only a year older. Which if anything, makes me even more attracted to him--his confidence and the idea that he knows what he's doing and could kinda show me the ropes, if he's up for that.

We've made plans to hang out again, and I'd really appreciate my gaybros' take: when and how should I bring up the fact that even though I initiated things, I actually have NO idea what I'm doing?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL;DR the title.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m 23, and have been out for less than a year. I finally gathered the confidence to try OKC a few months ago. Went on a few dates that didn&amp;#39;t go anywhere. Struggled to find anyone I was that into and was just about ready to give up for a while, when suddenly &amp;quot;G&amp;quot; likes me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s super handsome and more importantly seems like a great match personality-wise so I like him back and start a conversation. We hit it off, chat over the weekend, and start texting daily. We go on a drunken/stoned whirlwind of a date the following weekend and have a great time (from what we can each remember lol). The texting continues and gets quite flirty, and we go on another date the following Thursday (last night). We smoke but stay much more sober this time, and still make good conversation and have a really enjoyable night.

Thanks so much for all of the suggestions and different viewpoints. We've talked it through a little bit more. 

In his opinion everything comes back to me - I'm constantly down and depressed and it's making him frustrated and unhappy leading to the violence. 

We are clearly not both giving it 100% but at this point I may be the only one trying or willing to get help and accept blame. 

I can empathise and being with some one like me with mental health issues and a physical disability (deaf) can be a struggle. 

Still going to give it my best shot. 

Has anyone got any tips for bringing up difficult topics ofconversation? ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Update to the previous

My concerns thickens, because what I am in fact ALWAYS interested in is having sexual encounters. I'm on Grindr constantly trying to find hook ups. Lots of guys have asked to go on a date. My mind just kinda says, ""waste of time"".
I seem to never want to let myself invest in people because I feel like somehow I'll end up getting hurt (I'm a very sensitive guy). 

I've always been one to want instant gratification. I really dislike that about myself. While I'm a very amicable and caring person face to face, friendships have never been my strong point. While I'm upbeat and friendly I'm also very sarcastic and have dry humor. People often think I'm a bitch. I have over 1,000 Facebook friends and hang out with none of them.

I never had a true super ""slutty period"" in life. I've always fooled around with guys, but never aggressively went seeking it like I'm doing now.
