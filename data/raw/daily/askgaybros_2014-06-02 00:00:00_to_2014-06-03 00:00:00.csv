It can be subtle where I am aware that I am myself, but with a slightly different personality... Or it can be extreme like mirroring someone else (for example, Barack Obama) and taking on his mannerisms and personality. I even start to think in their voice. I would imagine myself as being someone else and I start to act like someone else. I feel like that someone else, but I can spontaneously become aware of my real identity.

I've been reading about maladaptive daydreaming and related anxiety coping mechanisms, but I don't feel like it was any help. I don't hate myself, I don't have any undealt-with trauma (in fact that suggestion nearly made me believe that I was a victim of sexual abuse) or use it to escape anything. I am a very chill person despite having several types of anxiety (mostly OCD), but for whatever reason I tend to fantasize a lot and sometimes even fantasize to extremes. I could fantasize an entire day. I admit that I do neglect my social life, but I am very busy with my projects and I have plenty of things to keep me preoccupied. It's summer and I have free time and there's a lot I want to do and learn. I guess I could be using it as a substitute to having conversations with other people, but it can be difficult to find people who share the same interests and way of thinking. I have a friend who I connect with when he does acid. I love our experiences together and I fantasize about him sexually but that's nothing unusual right? He is bisexual and it feels like we've already explored each other sexually without having had sex. I've had plenty of orgasms without being physical stimulated, thanks to him. He knows this and think it's amazing, at least when he's on acid or stoned. As I typed this message, I imagined myself as several different people.

I have schizoaffective, but I don't think this is necessarily an extension of that, I think this is something that I've been doing forever, since I was a child.

I am trying to understand it because I want to live in the real world and not get lost in fantasy again. I do enjoy daydreaming and it is the source of all my work. The visuals and movies especially.

Anyway, a little info.

I'm 16, living in Alabama.

Probably for the past 3 years, I've been having homosexual thoughts. Not really big ones though, until recently. I'm at least 80% sure that this isn't a phase. I'm fine with whichever way I end up, but if I am gay, I need some help. 

Obviously, due to living in the Bible Belt, religion is a major problem. I'm atheist, which most of my friends know, and I'm pretty sure my parents have figured it out already. I plan on going to College out of state, so as long as I could survive another two years properly, I'd be fine. But if I realize I am gay before that, how should I deal with that issue?

Second, I have a girlfriend right now. I've been getting pretty distant from her lately, and I don't know how to end it between us should I figure out that I am gay.

Lastly, I just don't know how to properly explain it to people, I don't feel prepared for questions that they might ask, and I'm just scared. I'm fine with being gay if I am, I'm just worried about people who aren't fine with it.

Thank you.

I've been sexually active for a few years now but I haven't really had a lot of sex and the sex that I have had has mostly been oral. I have very low self esteem when it comes to my body. The problem isn't that I lack muscle, or that I'm fat, but that I have a condition called Pectus Excavatum. Essentially it's when there's a dip in your chest so that when your laying down, you can use it as a bowl. Below is the google image search for it.

https://www.google.com/search?q=pectus+excavatum&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cuqLU4r0OaiksQS5jIDICg&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1536&amp;bih=755#imgdii=_

My case isn't that bad, but it does come with some rib flare that's pretty noticeable. I've never had anyone reject me for it before, but people comment on my ribs sometimes and it's really affecting my self confidence. Surgery isn't an option so I really just have to learn to live with it. 

Pectus Excavatum is actually a pretty common condition among men. If you go to a crowded locker room, you will almost certainly be able to find someone who has it.

I just wanted to ask any gay bros with the condition how it affected their sex and love life and how they compensated for it in any way. If anyone else has anything to say about their opinions on it, I'd like to hear it.

My boyfriend and I became long distance about two weeks ago. Sex has been amazing, but fairly 'vanilla.' Neither one of us is crazy about anal, so it's been a lot of handjobs, oral, making out. He's into bondage and ""making me moan,"" so the most extreme thing we've done, he's tied me up and edged me/post-orgasm tortured me.

So, being long distance, in an attempt to keep things hot, we've been talking about kinks a lot. He's told me he'd love to tickle me. He's told me he likes armpits. I've told him I like armpits and feet.. but I'm holding a lot back. Most of my kinks are tied to smell. Bad smells. Yeah, I like looking at and touching feet, but I really get off on having them pressed up against my face, covering my nose. Playing with his armpits myself would be okay, but having him hold my head in a headlock into his pits would be better. And then things get really really.... bad. I really like asses, and would love to have him sit on my face. Make me smell his ass. .....I also have an interest in farts. I've never tried it... But I've found it in porn, and I'm so turned on by the thought of being pinned down and farted on.

That's an extreme example, but it's representative of my relationship with all kinks. Just really dark and... dirty. Not just let me have your feet, but force me to take your feet... I'm telling him about half of my kinks, and I feel like I'm only being honest about half of the half of my kinks I'm telling him about. I feel so... disgusting. Sex between us has been really nice, and loving, and AMAZING, but all of my kinks are fucked up. And I don't ever want him to think the sex we've been having is inadequate to me, because my desires are so gross/intense in comparison. I also don't want him to think of me as the guy that just wants to be sat on/farted on/smothered by his feet. 

I feel disgusting and don't want him to think I'm disgusting. But I miss him, and am feeling bad for telling him half-truths/lying to him..

I started talking to this guy, from Reddit actually, and things are going really well. he lives pretty far away, but I can travel and it doesn't bother me at all. I can stay faithful and I don't have jealousy issues. 

Anyway, I haven't told him that I am going through a divorce. I haven't told anyone but my sister. I also have two kids.

For that matter, are kids a deal breaker? 

Just so everything is clear, my (soon to be ex) wife knows that I am talking to him and is really supportive of me moving on and finding someone else. She has always known that I prefer men. I'm not crazy nervous about telling him, but this isn't something I really want anyone else to be a part of. Even though it's amicable, I am still extremely torn up about losing the ""partner"" part of a marriage.

Throwaway for obvious reasons ... and even then, I'm still a little concerned about the amount of detail I have to go into, but I'm really in need of help/advice so hopefully one (or many) of you is/are willing to help!

I'm a guy who's been out to his family and friends for a number of years now. Since coming out however, I've developed very serious anxiety around dating and relationships. When I am single, or in a stable relationship, you wouldn't know I ever suffer from anxiety--and to be honest, most of the world has not a clue I struggle with it--but when I start dating someone I deal with very serious anxiety that leaves me tired, unable/willing to communicate, and unable to concentrate among other things. In previous relationships (there have been a few, of varying durations) I've ridden the wave of anxiety (sometimes more successfully than others) along with some professional help, and lots of understanding and support from my family and very close friends. Each of these situations has been overcome in my eyes and I've returned back on track with everything in a matter of a month or two. When relationships come to an end for me I don't tend to get anxious ... there's a sense of finality (whether I'm the do-er, or not) and I am hurt and sad, but tend to follow a much more ""normal"" path in terms of dealing with a break-up.

After a couple of years single (with dates here and there), I've recently begun to seriously see someone again (it's a few weeks in here), and honestly he's super awesome (and ""super awesome"" does not do him justice ... but I've got to draw the line somewhere). While I'm sure a bit of this is my anxiety talking I do feel that as I get older I get a better idea of who I'm looking for, and to have found someone after narrowing down what I'm looking for a bit more is very exciting. Over the past few years I found myself losing interest in a lot of guys for one reason or another, but this dude is really the shit.

Fluffy stuff aside, the anxiety I've had to deal with here has been nothing short of absolutely debilitating. I've lost a noticeable amount of weight, and a number of my friendships have taken the back-burner (while others have been set to full-throttle, out of necessity). I'm starting to think negatively about the majority of things in my life and all-in-all I'm finding it very difficult to get out of this hole. When I've dealt with this previously it's always been a mixture of family support, short-term medication, and time that have helped get me through it. This time (for a number of reasons) I think the anxiety will last a bit longer and I'm starting to think (after having this occur multiple times) that it's high time I started taking seriously the option of medication. Most medications for anxiety, however, lead to serious intimacy issues (low/no libido, inability to remain erect, inability to orgasm) ... and these issues obviously would pose major hurdles to a budding relationship. A doctor the other day told me there were some that didn't have these side effects. If such is the case, then sign me up!

Anyways, at this point I'm reaching out because I want to know if anyone else has dealt with similar situations, or knows the stories of friends/family members who have. I find it hard to sympathize with individuals who have GAD over other issues in life (school, etc.) because I've talked myself into thinking that anxiety over relationships, where there is another person very intimately involved, is different. I also find it difficult to sympathize with straight people in these situations because there's a whole added LGBT layer that brings in so many nuances it's hard to describe. Anyhow, any tips/suggestions.

TL;DR: Has you or anyone you know every dealt with major (cliniclally-recognized) anxiety in relationships? If so, what have your/their experiences been and what have been the solutions? Much appreciated guys. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey Guys,&lt;/p&gt;

While I&amp;#39;m sure a bit of this is my anxiety talking I do feel that as I get older I get a better idea of who I&amp;#39;m looking for, and to have found someone after narrowing down what I&amp;#39;m looking for a bit more is very exciting. Over the past few years I found myself losing interest in a lot of guys for one reason or another, but this dude is really the shit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fluffy stuff aside, the anxiety I&amp;#39;ve had to deal with here has been nothing short of absolutely debilitating. I&amp;#39;ve lost a noticeable amount of weight, and a number of my friendships have taken the back-burner (while others have been set to full-throttle, out of necessity). I&amp;#39;m starting to think negatively about the majority of things in my life and all-in-all I&amp;#39;m finding it very difficult to get out of this hole. When I&amp;#39;ve dealt with this previously it&amp;#39;s always been a mixture of family support, short-term medication, and time that have helped get me through it. This time (for a number of reasons) I think the anxiety will last a bit longer and I&amp;#39;m starting to think (after having this occur multiple times) that it&amp;#39;s high time I started taking seriously the option of medication. Most medications for anxiety, however, lead to serious intimacy issues (low/no libido, inability to remain erect, inability to orgasm) ... and these issues obviously would pose major hurdles to a budding relationship. A doctor the other day told me there were some that didn&amp;#39;t have these side effects. If such is the case, then sign me up!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, at this point I&amp;#39;m reaching out because I want to know if anyone else has dealt with similar situations, or knows the stories of friends/family members who have. I find it hard to sympathize with individuals who have GAD over other issues in life (school, etc.) because I&amp;#39;ve talked myself into thinking that anxiety over relationships, where there is another person very intimately involved, is different. I also find it difficult to sympathize with straight people in these situations because there&amp;#39;s a whole added LGBT layer that brings in so many nuances it&amp;#39;s hard to describe. Anyhow, any tips/suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Has you or anyone you know every dealt with major (cliniclally-recognized) anxiety in relationships? If so, what have your/their experiences been and what have been the solutions? Much appreciated guys. &lt;/p&gt;

He was really cute, very much my type, (the whole twink thing is hot to me, it's everything I will never be) so I started talking to him. 

He claimed to be 19, pretty young for me, but it isn't like we were discussing a relationship. After a few replies, he asked for my # and I gave it to him. 

A few texts in I was getting a very immature vibe from him, he was doing a lot of bragging about drugs etc that most adults just don't do. Then he sent me another pic, in which he looked significantly younger than his profile.

I asked again his age, and he answered with ""I'm legal, that's all that matters"". After some nagging he finally admitted to being 16.

I tried to explain how dangerous a situation he could put himself in, he opened up about a lot of molestation and drug use as well as parental issues. I feel bad for the kid, he's young, gay and alone in a very conservative rural area. I know what that's like. 

He keeps calling. I've told him it makes me uncomfortable when he's blatantly sexual, which is often. He doesn't understand why and keeps reminding me he's legal. But when he's not talking in a sexual manner he seems so vulnerable and I really think he's hurting, desperately crying out for attention. 

I'm very concerned about the path he's on. I acted out in a similar way and know where it got me. I feel like contacting his family, but I'm concerned they could turn on me and see me as a predator, especially if they get defensive. Yeah, legally it's ok, but what parent would agree? I wouldn't, I know that. 

I don't know whether I should continue to try to be an adult figure in this kids life, if I should talk to parents, or if I should just cut all contact. He doesn't look 16, and yeah, he's legal, but he's a kid, and he's trying to grow up too fast. 

Is it possible to be a mentor type without people jumping to assumptions? Or am I putting myself in a bad situation no matter what? Would you try to be there for him or cut bait and forget it? 

This kid is headed to trouble. I just hate so much to see him ruin his life so young. I don't understand where the parents are.

BACKGROUND STORY (Copy and paste from my last post)

""I've been friendly with this guy for a while. Contact was pretty mutual, but we never really hung out in person too often due to our age difference (me being a few years older). Always snapchatting me selfies and usually being the only one to always respond to my snapchat stories. Randomly texting about random things. He made me feel good about myself, and I was developing feelings down the road. Problem was (and usually the case in general) is that he's to my knowledge straight.

I have drunk texted him in the past a few times. During those instances, he would either ignore me or find it funny. I even sent a &lt;3 symbol a couple of those times and he would say stuff like ""funny' or ""you wish."" He doesn't really drink much so he wouldn't be one to reciprocate in that manner.

Then this was when I fucked it up...a few weeks ago, I was out with friends and got drunk again. I texted him and he told me he couldn't talk. I said to him ""ok ;) &lt;3,"" then he texted back right away saying ""stop.""

The next day I apologized for pissing him off; all he said was ""lol we're cool"" and changed the subject. I've gotten the message now that I can no longer try to pursue him; I figured if he was remotely interested in me, let alone guys, he would've tried to flirt with me back. I feel like crap for putting the friendship in jeopardy, but I need to get over him. I'm afraid if I come out to him anytime soon, he'll put two and two together and it may be more awkward...but this is not where it ends...

He doesn't initiate texting with me as much as he used to, nor does he reply (as much) to my snapchats or initiate sending snaps. When I suggest hanging out, he started to blow me off usually instead of instantly willing to join me, but whenever we're together in person otherwise (have a couple of mutual acquaintances), he's still very friendly with me and tries to talk to me.""

END BACKGROUND INFO

So since that last post, this friend would only talk to me to rant about what was bothering him and if he needed favors.  He started to become a friend of convenience.  I asked him a couple of weeks ago to go to dinner (early in the day) and he said maybe and will let me know later in the afternoon.  It was late afternoon and I messaged him asking if he knows if he'll be around.  He said he still doesn't know because he doesn't know what his other friends are doing.  He never got back to me.  I removed him from my phone, removed all text and fb message conversations, but still kept him on my fb friends list.  After a week and a half of not speaking to me, he messaged me asking a question about a video game.  I ignored it and he didn't message again since...but then he started to like and comment on my statuses more frequently and I wouldn't acknowledge them.  And finally for what it's worth, he shared some anti-gay bashing video and told everyone to watch it.  

It's bothering me a lot because I want to be friends and I also want something more.  I wish I knew how he really felt about me, too.  I'm sure he's straight, but you never know.
