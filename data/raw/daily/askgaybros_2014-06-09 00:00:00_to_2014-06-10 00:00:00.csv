So I'm in an interesting situation with a guy right now. I met him a few weeks ago, and we hung out once, hooked up, and have kept in pretty close contact ever since. He was a really cool guy, attractive as hell, down to earth, and honest and upfront about his life. The sex was killer, cuddle times were mad awesome, and he went to a college that was near mine. I saw that he was someone that I could potentially be in a happy relationship with, and talked to him about this.

Unfortunately for me, he had his own set of issues that he had to deal with. First of all, we both went our separate ways for the summer. He went home, and I'm working in a strange place where I don't know anyone. They're a few hours away, but both of us have full time jobs. Doable, but difficult. In addition to this, he also just got out of a nasty breakup about a month ago with an ex who was cheating on him. To top that off, he was getting weaned off some meds that basically can mess up your brain chemistry. These factors, along with some other smaller factors, all caused him to say he wasn't ready for a relationship. However, he said that he thought I was genuinely the nicest and sweetest guy he knows, and that when he's ready for a relationship, I would be the one he'd turn to. However, he's still open to having a friends with benefits type of relationship.

Right now, I have no reason to doubt him. He was incredibly upfront and honest and told me all this stuff without me even asking. From what I know about him, he's a genuinely awesome guy, and these reasons why he isn't ready for a relationship are legitimate reasons. But the problem here is that, deep down, I have so many insecurities about guys and being ditched or used as a self-esteem boost. The last guy I was really into strung me along for months, talking every day, telling me how amazingly perfect I was, before completely abandoning me and running off with his new boyfriend. I have no reason to believe that this new guy would do anything of the sort to me, but it's still a fear that I have because of the previous guy. 

So, bros, I guess what I'm asking here is what the fuck I should do. Right now, I'm in a strange place where I know nobody, and having him as a friend just to talk and hang out with even just a few times would be great. I know I'm not going to find anything that could potentially last this summer, given that I'm a few thousand miles from where I go to college, but I also don't want to just shut down and wait for this guy who, if my perception of him is wrong, could just be stringing me along for his own benefit, especially because there's no way to know when he's going to be ready for a relationship. I also recognize that even though he said that I'd be the one he wants a relationship with, there's no way I can hold him to that after a few months, because feelings change and people meet other people and stuff. 

My current plan is to see him a few times, hook up with him, and potentially hook up with other people if I really feel like it, and then see what happens when we get back. However, if nothing happens, then I'd move on and meet other people. Is that a good plan? Or are there other factors I should consider?

Last summer me and my close friends, let's call them A (woman) B, C, and D (all men), went to A's family cottage for a long weekend holiday. We arrived Wednesday and me and D went fishing on the lake the same day. A and B, who had started dating at that point, made several sexual jokes about our fishing trip. We had watched Brokeback Mountain as a group some days earlier. It was actually quite funny. But I had feelings for D (no pun intended).

Friday comes and we had bought loads of alcohol. We started drinking and of course after a while we were all drunk. A, B and D drank some shots (I don't really like hard liquor, unless it's tequila :P). After that they were starting to get almost wasted. I stopped drinking at some point because I didn't want to get a hangover. D made a Skype video call to a lady friend of his. At one point during this video call D gestures me to come join him. I do and he wants to kiss me. D still identified as straight. We kissed several times during that night. I still had some feelings for D and didn't want to start full on making out so as the night went on I started to refuse to kiss D. D just kept drinking and finally passed out in the bathroom. A and B were dating and had gone to the bedroom earlier to do some yucky man-woman things. I was sobering up and became really worried about D. I'm a small guy so I didn't have the strenght to move him to this bed, so I watched over him, waking him up several times to make sure he was okay. After a couple hours his started to feel ""better"" and I helped him move to his bed. Next day I bought him painkillers to ease the headache. He was really grateful that I had taken care of him and my feelings towards him intensified. C came Saturday to the cottage and being D's best friend looked a bit worried when he heard stories about the Friday night. He had at first been at unease because of A and B dating, fearing it could break up the friend group.

I decided that I wouldn't want to risk anything and thought I had managed to get rid of my feelings towards D. Since last summer D has actually become quite sure that he is bisexual and me and D have had some flirting, sometimes kissing when we had drunk some alcohol. However, during the last couple months I've felt the feelings come back. I still didn't want to risk anything so I didn't act on these feelings.

So, last night me, A, B and D decided we wanted some alcohol. C is in the military currently, so he couldn't join us. We started drinking at A and B's place and couple hours I later me and D were sitting on the couch. He had gotten quite close to me and iniated things by kissing me on the cheek, I returned the favor. We started cuddling on the couch and next thing we know we are making out. We hadn't really made out before. We keep cuddling the rest of the night, with a lot of making out. More than A and B who are a couple. Then the hands started going places, over and under clothes. I was staying at A and B's for the night but we decided some fresh air would be nice so we escorted D home. He lives with his parents and their dog is his responsibility so he couldn't stay the night. We were still all over each other when we walked to his home and still made out, in public.

Now I'm confused. Partly I feel guilty because I didn't stop what was happening last night. I don't want to risk things but somehow it felt so right. I'm thinking I should talk about things with him while sober but I'm afraid. What if it makes things awkward between us?

Maybe I told stuff which wasn't relevant but I had to get this out of my system.

Anyways I guess backstories are in order. 

So, I have this friend who lives about 12 hours away from me, for story sake I'll call him Danny. He and I have a little bit of history going back. We talk on skype frequently. Like he and I would always have sexual conversations and things. Eventually this year our skype sexcapades grew a bit more. He's told me that he's a little curious at least and would like to try some things out when he meets me this week. We had been talking about his curiosities for several months now. He said that he'd only really trust me to do that with and he doesn't live in the most ""accepting"" of areas.

Now for the conflict. I met this really cool guy at a gay bar about a month ago. We'll call him Jon. So the night I met Jon we literally danced the whole night together after we met. The next morning he texted me and we quite literally haven't stopped talking since. This past week we went out on a date together and it was just wonderful. We had dinner, walked around the mall and sat on a bench overlooking a harbor eating ice cream. That date couldn't' have gone any better. I really really like this guy, he's just so sweet and caring. We talk all the time and my face just lights up whenever I talk to or about him.

So I really really like Jon, and though we aren't officially dating right now, I would really like to soon. At the current time It just feels a bit too soon, we've only met twice so far. On the other hand I really want to help out Danny with his curiosities. My ex helped me with my bicuriousness and it changed my life for the better. At this point I think it would be Ok to fool around with Danny a bit, especially since in the end he's just going to go back to Florida and nothing is gonna come of it. However I'm conflicted about it. I still want to help Danny but I don't wanna mess things up with Jon.

So gaybros, what should I do? should I not do anything with Danny? Or on the off hand if I do some things with Danny; when or should I tell Jon about it? The timing is just so difficult right now. I'm confused

Thanks in advance.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;m a bi guy who just started seeing this super sweet gay guy. Anyways I guess backstories are in order. &lt;/p&gt;

It's something that's been weighing on my mind for a few months. I feel like a horrible person. I've recently started dating again after a long break.  Things have gone great with a few guys.  HOWEVER, anytime I am with a guy who is circumcised, I get really bored and frustrated during sexytime.   The very first guy I was with had a foreskin and most of the guys I’ve dated since then have been uncut by happenstance. I'm becoming more mature and expanding my dating pool that includes all types of guys based on other attributes aside from physical attraction.   My problem is that I really know what to do with a foreskin and can bring a uncut guy to his knees pretty quickly.  heh. However, with a circumcised guy, I feel like all the effort I’m putting in isn’t garnering the same response and results. I feel like he's just there, waiting for a bus to arrive and I'm pumping a dry well.   I feel extremely horrible after the last few guys I’ve gone on dates with have been REALLY great guys, but sexually I’m just not ‘there’ when it comes to their cut penises.    Yes, I know I need to get my head out of my bum...and is there some way to broach the subject delicately before we rip off our clothes and having to awkwardly tell him I'm just not into him that way?   I feel like such a loser since I know most guys in the US are statistically more likely to be cut.   Thanks, bros!

My roommate and I have been messing around for a year or so now, hes blown me a lot, many handjobs, and I've always gotten into them unless I was high where my mind can wander and my dick gets a little soft.

He recently got some dental work done, and his mouth has been sore so he wanted to try to ride me. I was cool with the idea, so he jacked me off a little with lube, and through a short struggle he got me in him and it felt okay, but I got quickly softer and fell out. After a few half-hard tries we put it up to the weed we smoked a few hours before and we'll try again tonight.

Thing is I was pretty sober by the time we were going at it, and I'm not sure how I can improve the situation to get into it more. 
Hes the 2nd guy to want me to fuck him, and I've never been able to follow through.

I hear it feels amazing, I want to badly, but my dick wont cooperate. 

I've been known to stress out over staying hard before and sabotaging myself so I was hoping for some advice on getting this to work out the first time when we try again.

My cock is lying to me, right? Once I'm hard, lubed, and in him it'll be awesome right? 

My roommate is, short of my couple mins in him earlier, an anal virgin so any advice I can give him on this will help too. 
I was on my bed, and he was on me facing my legs. I think it felt odd going from my hand jacking off to get harder to his hand, to his ass. maybe I should just let him handle me from the start so there no difference once I'm turned on?.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys, I was hoping I could get a little advice.&lt;/p&gt;
