So, there is this guy I want to try dating, but I am thinking it is time to give up trying to make that happen.  We have been hooking up off and on now for about a year.  Back in December, after another evening of amazing sex, it felt like we had a moment.  We talked about it and he said he thought there was a moment there too.  However, he has never had a boyfriend before, never really dated before (he's 24 now) and I'm older (not crazy older but more than 5 years older) than him and I have done the whole BF thing before.  We have hooked up again a couple of times, once even on his birthday, where I was able to convince him to let me buy him breakfast.  it was our first ""date"" 
I have asked him a couple of times since then, its been almost a month, and he hasn't said yes, or has agreed but then never sets up a time.  I am not sure if it is just with me, or everyone but he is a really shitty texter, not zippy in the replies, sometime stops mid convo, etc.  The frustrating part is, he hints that he would be down dating too.  
I really like this guy, I could totally see dating him, LTR and everything but damn, I can't figure him out.  Is it time to just throw the cards on the table, ask him what he wants and if it doesn't match up what I want, move on or something else?  I have gotten to the point where I can't separate sex and emotion with this guy and it is fucking me up.  Advice?

So far, our plans are to go to six flags, see the 'X' on the road and try some local cock.
