Now here's something that bothers me. If you know your loved ones, who do love you and care for you, would begin to dislike you for being gay, why would you tell them that? If I had to choose between my sexuality and my family, I'd choose my family.

It's just sort of baffling to me when people know their family refer to homos as faggots and freaks and think it's going to turn out well when they decide to tell their family.

I've seen the argument that ""well, if they can't accept you, they don't deserve you"", but to me that's a very poor way to think. If they hate me for being gay, who am I to hate them for disliking homosexuals? It's unneccessary bridge-burning.

Alittle background:  I'm from Georgia, which is still probably one of the most racially divided states left.  This is especially true in the more rural areas where I lived.  So basically I grew up around the sentiment that basically white people are the best and other races are not.(That is not a sentiment that I still hold thankfully especially after leaving and moving to California)

 It's not something that I was taught directly but growing up I saw how my parents and other adults acted around people of color and those they perceived as different.  This is something I've literally had to battle against in my mind growing up.  You know those in the heat of the moment thoughts you sometimes have that you know would hurt someone deeply if you said it aloud but then as soon as you think that you reprimand yourself for thinking such terrible things about them.  At least that's been my experience.  I've hated myself and my upbringing for this for a very long time.  Although I think as I've gotten older I'm more able to get a handle on it now. Obviously I don't act on those thoughts/emotions either which I feel is a huge factor.  I treat people as people no matter their race.

So on to my question/problem.  I can honestly say I've never seen a full on dark skinned black person that I'm attracted to physically.  I can't recall a single black person that I would think to myself, "" damn I want to do him so bad!""  I do want to say that I have no ill feelings consciously against black people. I think they are the same as everyone else.  I don't consider them a lesser race or anything crazy like that.  I wouldn't be opposed to dating a black guy if I found one to be attractive and with other qualities I look for.(intelligence, humor etc).  I am in a serious relationship already though so that point is kind of moot.

I guess my question is do you think my lack of physical attraction to black people is due to my upbringing or just personal preference?  I also have no problem with dark skinned people either.  My bf is Asian(rather tanned) and I think guys like Tyler Posey and Taylor Lautner are super hot. But at the same time guys like Denzel Washington or Will Smith do nothing for me.

We've been through a lot together already (family issues), and we both strongly support each other when we need it most. I really, really love him. However, our libidos seem to be contrasting. His is quite low, and mine is very, very- VERY high. I haven't always been like this though- I left a previous relationship where I would go weeks, sometimes months without wanting to engage in any activities. Now, though, and without fail, I could and want to have him every day, multiple times a day. I know this isn't necessarily a normal desire, because relationships tend to reach a point of normality after a while, but I really can't keep my hands off of him. 

Something to consider, which is actually making it much worse for me, is that I've recently started taking a medication for depression (non-SSRI) which super charges my libido, even more so from its normal high. 

When I ask him if he's in the mood, or try to initiate it, he apologizes and explains that he's just been in a sexual 'low' lately, which is completely understanding and I try not to impress any pressure on him, because that wouldn't be fair and it would be damaging to the relationship. However, every time that happens, I think back to my previous relationship and consider whether or not he's as attracted to me as I am to him (the main reason my libido was low previously). 

One more piece of information: We do have 'fun' about once every 4-7 days, which I'm pretty sure is 'normal', but I want it every day, or at least every-other. It's hard for me to focus when I'm SO in the mood and he's laying right there in all of his glory, but he just wants to relax. 

My question is-- are there people out there who are in relationships with someone whose libido is either significantly higher or lower than theirs? How do you make it work? What are some tips you have? Is there a way to safely lower my libido (I don't want to even try to increase his, because there's nothing wrong with him and I feel like I'm just too charged)?

I've got a beautiful bf, a stable job earning an okay income, friends that would do anything for me and family that loves me.  However I work full time, study full time, run my own business which is failing (not from a lack of trying to keep it from sinking), massive debt due to said business, slipping grades, jealousy issues with relationship, family issues and trying to find my feet as a self sufficient adult.  I am the sounding board for everyone else's problems, the rock for everyone to lean on, I'm generous, loyal and trusting to a fault.

Before anyone suggests that I'm vain, I'm NOT; far from it, actually.  I'm average-looking, and have always lacked self-confidence. That's why this recent obsession of mine is worth looking into.

So I'm from Singapore, currently going through my second year in college. Since earlier this year, I've realized and started to accept that I'm gay. As it stands now, the local government doesn't give a crap about us LGBT folk (gay sex is illegal here, although it's supposedly just ""symbolic""), the society here is generally too conservative (because Asia) to be openly gay or show any forms of homosexual PDA. Most parents - mine included, [from what I've heard from them](http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/2b7m3z/what_do_you_make_of_my_dads_opinion/) - basically can't accept their children being gay, attributes it to improper upbringing and/or bad influence.

So what I'm asking is, what should I do then? I've talked to some guys from here on Reddit, and their best advice would be to move to somewhere more LGBT-friendly. But where would be the best place?

I haven't come out to anyone, so no one knows I'm gay. I have a friend, I've known him since 6th grade and he is in my history class. Since the year started (around late August) he has been making prolonged eye contact with me and doing things like touching my foot with his and unnecessarily touching me in other ways (i.e., after turning in a paper he walked past and purposely grazed his butt on my arm). As he has been doing this I have started liking him more and more. He always wants to be my partner for projects and I am the first one he asks when he forgets a book or the homework. He sits one seat to the right and one forward, but we do a lot of group work so I am always interacting with him. The person who sits behind me is consistently absent and when that person is gone he always jumps on the opportunity to sit there. He will touch my back with his hand and my legs with his feet. I am really starting to like him and I get butterflies whenever i think of him. One day we were in the library and we were working on a project sitting at a table alone across from each other. I had to go get something and when i got back his legs were under the table where mine would be, so when i sat down we had a lot of contact and touching between our legs. This continued throughout the period and we kept making obvious movements so that each other would notice, neither of us ever pulled away. These signs lead me to believe there is something there. He is constantly on my mind and I am really scared to ask him since we are in high school and people can be hostile or spread that I am gay (which I don't want people to know yet). I am also unsure because he is Mormon. I feel like I can't stop being anxious till I know if there is something between us. Any advice would be much appreciated. Please excuse any grammar errors :) and thank you to anyone who helps.

Edit: Since I would get really nervous in person, would it be too impersonal to ask him through text?

As he has been doing this I have started liking him more and more. He always wants to be my partner for projects and I am the first one he asks when he forgets a book or the homework. He sits one seat to the right and one forward, but we do a lot of group work so I am always interacting with him. The person who sits behind me is consistently absent and when that person is gone he always jumps on the opportunity to sit there. He will touch my back with his hand and my legs with his feet. I am really starting to like him and I get butterflies whenever i think of him. One day we were in the library and we were working on a project sitting at a table alone across from each other. I had to go get something and when i got back his legs were under the table where mine would be, so when i sat down we had a lot of contact and touching between our legs. This continued throughout the period and we kept making obvious movements so that each other would notice, neither of us ever pulled away. These signs lead me to believe there is something there. He is constantly on my mind and I am really scared to ask him since we are in high school and people can be hostile or spread that I am gay (which I don&amp;#39;t want people to know yet). I am also unsure because he is Mormon. I feel like I can&amp;#39;t stop being anxious till I know if there is something between us. Any advice would be much appreciated. Please excuse any grammar errors :) and thank you to anyone who helps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Since I would get really nervous in person, would it be too impersonal to ask him through text? Or is this something that needs to be face to face?&lt;/p&gt;

Kinda new to this reddit thing so bare with me. I just need a little outside perspective.

So I'm 22 years old, a male, and I've been out of the closet for almost 4 years now. I didn't get any extreme negative reactions when I came out and all of my friends were accepting and if anything it brought me even closer to them. I can't say my family was thrilled by the idea of me being gay but they still love me and have made a ton of progress in becoming more accepting. My issue here is that I seem to always fall for the wrong guy... The ones I can't have... The straight ones. It is crazy to me because for much of my life, I always looked at fellow gay men who chased straight guys with a bit of disdain. Like if you know they're straight then why bother, right? Maybe this is karma coming for my ass for being a judge-y bitch and now I'm just destined to be attracted to men that I can't have, or maybe I’m just doing something wrong. I’m not attracted to fem guys at all. I am 100% bottom but I myself and not fem and people usually have a hard time telling I’m gay.


 I've only been in one relationship with someone I met on twitter. It was long distance though we did meet a few times and while he looked the way he said he looked, I have since been given reason to believe that he lied about everything else (personal history and such). As the case always is with me, he identified as straight, though now he is starting to come to better terms with his true sexuality since the guy he dated after me (despite the fact that I was the ‘one exception” -_-) tragically thought it would be suitable to out him. I'm not here to talk about him though.  


I want to know why I can't seem to fall for gay men the way that i fall for straight men. Is this some sort of shit stigma I've fallen into? Even in high school when there were other gay men in my class I never had eyes for them, and instead fell head over heels for my unavailable, straight best friend which eventually led me to abandon the friendship all-together (this is before I was out btw) because I felt that if I ever confessed, the friendship would have ended anyway. I mean I spent every waking moment with this guy and his gf, and every now and then in privacy he would jokingly say something about how he could be bi. I never put much weight behind it but there was a time when he and his SO were in a bad place and he was considering leaving her (just want to mention that they had been renting rooms and living on their own since they were about 16 and at the time I'm speaking of we were 18 and they'd already put a few years into the relationship). When I heard he was thinking about breaking up it took every fiber of my being to not encourage him to leave her and start a life with me, but at this point I was just as close to her as I was to him so that seemed kinda grimy to me. In the end they stayed together and some time later I just pulled away from both of them because being a third wheel in that situation just fucking sucks. But it doesn't even end with him. That was just the first and worst case so far. Since then I have fallen for countless straight friends of mine, half of which aren't even good guys.   


After the ordeal with the guy mentioned above though, and because I never wanted to have to give up such a good friend again, I vowed to never abandon a friendship just because I was crushing on someone. I figure I should just be straight-forward and see what happens. So that is what I've been doing. Mostly I do this and the friendships end anyway, but a few times I have maintained the friendship afterwards. What has never happened, however, is a reciprocation of my feelings, EVER! Aside from twitter man, but he doesn't really count since the whole reason it didn't work is because he identified, at the time, as straight and refused to consider, even after a year and a half, moving into any semblance of a serious relationship. I’m beginning to think somethings wrong with me. I even confronted feelings that I had for another gay guy recently and he politely said to me “Throwaway, I just want to be friends.” And we still are but.. what gives? I struck out on my own 2 years ago to SF Bay area thinking, hey there's a pretty big gay population there, things will definitely look up!” and they haven’t. It’s the same shit. Me falling mostly for straight men. Me getting rejected. Me losing friends. I’m pretty sure I’m not bad looking, but maybe I should see the AmIUgly subred for that answer. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve been single for years, I only have a hand full of friends out here, no family, so I’m pretty fucking alone. How do I break this habit and find men that I actually stand a chance with? What am I doing wrong. Help? Anyone?

Sensations during sex were amplified, but I never actually finished with a toy inserted to find out just how much feeling I got from it.

I guess I'm worried that if I ever decide to go through with bottoming for someone, I won't enjoy it much as I haven't enjoyed anal play with toys. I've heard the stories of how great anal play can be and I'd love more than anything to be able to feel the same things, but so far I can't.

He was nice, cute, interesting but I assumed he was straight and never gave him that much thought. We hung out a few times at school events, and became good friends, but never *that* close.

A few months ago I found out that he is gay, and that he knows I'm gay as well. It came up naturally in conversation, but I was surprised.

Since then I have started to develop feelings for him. I value his friendship, but I want more. I've got some hints that he might be interested in me (mostly just how friendly he is with me), but I am still not sure.

We have been drifting apart lately. I have not seen him in a few weeks. We are in different classes and have different groups of friends. I want to make a move before it's too late.

I have never asked anyone out except online. I do not know if he is interested in me, or even if he is single. I know I should say something to him, but I'm not sure what. Some things I have thought about doing:

(1) Asking him out on a date


(2) asking him to hang out as friends and then flirting with him (this would be new to me, Ive never flirted with anyone in real life)

(3) asking him to hang out and then being honest about my feelings

(4) sending him a long facebook message explaining how I feel

(5) Getting a mutual friend to find out if he is interested (yes, I'm a pre-teen girl with a crush)

(6) Not doing anything and hope we somehow start seeing each other more

(7) Wait until the next time we are in the same room, pulling him aside, and telling him the truth. This might not be for a few more weeks,

If anyone has any tips for how to make a move, without risking our friendship or coming off creepy and desperate, let me know. I am not *in love* with the guy, but I do spend an unpleasant amount of time thinking about him.

TLDR: I like a guy. I want to take it from friends to something more. tips?

We hung out a few times at school events, and became good friends, but never &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months ago I found out that he is gay, and that he knows I&amp;#39;m gay as well. It came up naturally in conversation, but I was surprised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then I have started to develop feelings for him. I value his friendship, but I want more. I&amp;#39;ve got some hints that he might be interested in me (mostly just how friendly he is with me), but I am still not sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have been drifting apart lately. I have not seen him in a few weeks. We are in different classes and have different groups of friends. I want to make a move before it&amp;#39;s too late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have never asked anyone out except online. I do not know if he is interested in me, or even if he is single. I know I should say something to him, but I&amp;#39;m not sure what. Some things I have thought about doing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) Asking him out on a date&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) asking him to hang out as friends and then flirting with him (this would be new to me, Ive never flirted with anyone in real life)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) asking him to hang out and then being honest about my feelings&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) sending him a long facebook message explaining how I feel&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(5) Getting a mutual friend to find out if he is interested (yes, I&amp;#39;m a pre-teen girl with a crush)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(6) Not doing anything and hope we somehow start seeing each other more&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(7) Wait until the next time we are in the same room, pulling him aside, and telling him the truth. This might not be for a few more weeks,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anyone has any tips for how to make a move, without risking our friendship or coming off creepy and desperate, let me know. I am not &lt;em&gt;in love&lt;/em&gt; with the guy, but I do spend an unpleasant amount of time thinking about him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR: I like a guy. I want to take it from friends to something more. tips?&lt;/p&gt;
