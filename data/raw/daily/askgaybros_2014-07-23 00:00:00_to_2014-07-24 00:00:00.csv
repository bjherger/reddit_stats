So I've only recently (round about the start of the year) accepted that I was gay, I struggled with it since I was about 13-14. Eventually I realised being a moping anti-social ball of nothing wasn't doing me any good and I've moved past most of my self-hatred and loathing. About a week or so ago I decided to stop hiding and out there and downloaded Grindr, just to see what was out there around my area. 

After wading through a butt-load of guys who had nothing more to say than horny/dtf/etc. I started talking with a guy who seemed nice, and different to anyone else on there. I guess, being new and naive I let my guard down a bit but I had been talking to him pretty regularly through the app on and off since I downloaded it. I don't know why (I guess it was my young naiveness again) but I just assumed we were around the same age so when he mentions he's turning 37 (I'm 25) I felt, I don't know, awkward? nervous? a little ill? A little betrayed? Perhaps I should have asked straight up, is that a thing you should do? or been a bit more guarded. I just feel a little bit creeped on I suppose. I mean, I guess we're adults and all that so I really shouldn't. Age is just a number I guess, but I'm not really into the big age gaps, at least not at the moment, plus I'm still trying to navigate this new world I'm in and I'm not looking to start anything, just talk. 

Now I don't really know what to say to him, or if I want to say anything at all? Should I say this to him? Block him? Just try and be less chatty? I'm a naturally chatty person so maybe I've given the wrong impression. I don't want to be mean and cut him off completely, but at the end of the day, he's really, as far as I know, just a picture on a phone.

tl;dr: Recently accepted I was gay, decided to try out Grindr, met a charming guy who didn't tell me he was 12 years older than me and we've been chatting on and off for about a week, feel kind of creeped on, not sure what to do or if I have been giving mixed signals and how to distance myself from him. Also looking for general internet dating advice.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a throwaway because you never know who is on the internet...&lt;/p&gt;

There's some gay guys, straight guys, a bi guy, and then the women are all supposedly straight. I'm having a lot of fun partying and getting drunk on the beach. Expected college kid behavior I guess. Anyway, the bi guy is kind of a player and he's also a douche. He's got the face, the body, the attitude, and he picks up a lot of girls and some guys too. To be honest, I think he's kind of trashy. He also smokes cigarettes like 2-3 other of these people I'm with and it makes me sick. I'm the guy who pretends to die of a coughing fit when I'm around cigarette smoke so they know how disrespectful it is.  
  
So he is always shitting on me because he thinks I'm a spoiled brat and a bit of a diva and I shit on him for being a skank, for his future lung cancer (most of my family had cancer due to smoking and I've lost many of them to that cancer, so it's important to me), and the fact that he always has to be a douche and outbro everyone whether we're playing sports, he chugging beer. He's the stereotypical, douchebag fratbro and I hate him. Well…  
  
Last night, we were getting drunk for like the 30th night in a row this summer (tip: to not get fat from alcohol barely eat throughout the day and then drink your bodyweight in cheap liquor at night…also work out a lot), and…well…we got into our teasing match. He's yelling. I'm yelling. We go inside to continue since everyone was getting annoyed (we were fighting about some political correctness thing he was so against…I forget) and all of a sudden he just stops talking. He crouches over me (I'm 5'8""…he's like 6'2"" so I thought he was about to beat the shit out of me) and then picks me up. I thought he was going to kill me. But he just brings me to our room (a few rooms in the house that we all divide up), throws me on his bed and just takes out his dick (it was like an average 6"" if anyone wants to know, but it's not important) and slaps me in the face with it, which made me laugh but then soon I was sucking it and he was telling me to roll over so he could eat my ass out. He then totally hate fucks me…and it was amazing.  
  
This morning, I kind of felt lovey-dovey feelings towards him that I've never felt before. He's acting like his pretty normal self and picking on me, but he isn't being a total dick about it for once. So I'm just acting normally too. We've also been sitting next to each other all day. I've been wanting to hold his hand or rest my head on his shoulder when we go to the beach, but I think that's too much. IDK. I've known him for years and have never been able to tolerate him much, but right now I'm falling for him.  
  
HELP.  
  
TL;DR my bi friend (sorry, no straightbro stories for you today lol) hate fucked me last night. We usually hate each other. Now I'm in love with him. Everyone knows he fucked me because they could hear it. I don't know how to proceed.

I started meeting guys just a few months ago and never had prior experience regarding kissing/sex. I kind of expected that I would suck at kissing/sex for some time.


Last month, some friends and I were at a gay bar and a guy got friendly with our group. Some time later, new guy and I were making out while dancing. After the first few kisses, I apologized and told him ""Sorry, I'm still new at this (kissing)"" (Before him, I've been with a few guys but did not meet with anyone for about 3 weeks). He said, ""Yeah, I can tell. It's OK."", then we continued kissing. As my friends and I were about to leave, he announced to my friends ""Your friend is such a good kisser!"" I really don't know why he said that, especially since it seemed to be a lie.


Fast forward to last weekend. Went to the hotel room of a person I met online, and we proceeded to kiss and cuddle (and other things). Later, as I was preparing to leave, he told me I was a great kisser, which surprised me a bit. I have not had ""practice"" between bar guy and hotel guy. I think I was a little less hesitant kissing with hotel guy, and I think I did OK, but I would not really call my kissing good or great...


I do tend to over-analyze things, but it left me wondering if I really am a good kisser. In the first place, what is a good kiss and what makes a person a great kisser? If taken to a higher level, how can I tell if a compliment is real or empty (just said to make me feel better about myself but does not really reflect the truth)?


Thanks in advance! :)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basically just the question in the title, but for some background:&lt;/p&gt;

Honestly I really like him, and would like to be more serious with him, but the two of us not being in a relationship I feel like is holding us back from spending more time together. I understand the he is decently busy, but I don't personally think he's as busy as he thinks he is.

Long wall of text - sry! Just really need some other unbiased people’s opinions. Here goes.

My ex-boyfriend, who I have not spoken to in two years, suddenly wrote to me the other day. He wanted “closure” after how things ended between us, because they ended really badly. To recap:

He broke up with me. Out of the blue. I did not see it coming at all, he had not made any suggestions what so ever that things weren’t going right. I kinda went in to shock, not knowing how to react, but I somehow “accepted” it, and lived in my own world - probably not realizing that he actually broke up with me. Anyhow, he breaks up with me by saying that he doesn’t love anymore and thinks that we should just be friends. I said “ok”, went out the bathroom for 30 minutes and cried a lot, went back and pretended like nothing had happened, all though he noticed. But I tried to accept it as much as possible, because I also somewhat thought that it was the right thing to do. Or maybe just the thing that would make him happy.

Fast forward a month later, where we meet-up again to work on just being friends. It’s weird. He replaces kissing with basically poking me with his nose (it is a weird as it sounds.) We both agree that saying “I love you” is of course of the table, so we agree to say something similar like “best friends forever-blahblah”. At the time I didn’t think it was that weird.

Well, we end up having sex two times too. Really strange sex, because we can’t kiss anylonger, and that used to be a big part of it. And each time, we agree afterwards that this must never ever happen again.

Fast forward a week, and we meet again. He is very distant, almost always texting and really doesn’t seem like he actually wants to help rebuild the friendship. But we have sex again. And still, I stay with him for a day more, because we are having some fun just hanging out together for once.

At this point, we have both created a profile on a dating page - he mostly forced me to create one, I didn’t really want to.
Suddenly, my phone rings. It’s a guy I’ve been talking a bit to on the dating website, but not really my type. The guy asks if I want to hang out and visit him. I’m pretty hesitant. I hang up the call and my ex, who is sitting right next to me, is all like: “Go visit him! Could be a lot of fun for you!”. And then comes the weird part: “Oh and bring a condom, you know, just in case!”. I thought it was a bit weird and was a bit like: that’s not gonna happen.
My ex pushes again, and I end up going visit this guy, but I leave some of my stuff behind at my ex’s place. I meet the guy and we actually end up hooking up. Not really that great of a guy, he was mostly like: I'm pretty horny. And I guess I kinda just wanted to try something new with somebody else - I was single afterall.

Next day, I go back to my ex, who asks how it went. I say I’m not quite sure, but after some time, I admit that we had sex. My ex goes completely silent and after half an hour, he throws me out.
That’s the last time I see him. He wrote me two messages after that: About how hurt he was, how I could that, and that he would never ever talk to me again, and block me on Facebook etc. 
I answer back and try to explain things from my point of view. But I also apologize, because it was obviously kinda stupid what I did, and I regret it to this day. 
He didn't want closure at the time, and didn't respond when I confronted him with the above. I remember writing, that after he threw me out, I realized that he still loved me, and the he had lied for some unknown reason.

Now he wrote back to me, two years later. Both me and him are in new relationships, and I haven't thought of him for at least half a year.
He was mad about that I wrote that I realized that he still loved me - why I didn't fight more for it. And that he had no feelings for me now what so ever, and that was all he had to say.

I wrote back that it was and is a closed chapter for me, that I thought we should put behind us. And that I apologized one again for my behaviour.

I just want to know - how much can I blame myself for this and how it went down? Of course this is pretty biased, since it seen from my point of view, but still. How much am I the bad person here?

Thanks in advance for all your thoughts.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi guys!

A really good friend of mine recently came out as gay (kinda).  We are all 23, by the way.  Basically one night when he was really drunk, he came out to our group of friends over a Facebook message.  He also said weird stuff in the message, like ""it's ok if you don't want to be my friend anymore.""  We all said that was awesome, we support you, we're all still gonna be buds, etc.  I was surprised, but I also kind of realized there were signs all along and we just missed it.

Anyway, the next day I brought it up to him, and he just said, ""I don't want to talk about it.""  Cut me off immediately and said he wanted to change the subject.  I obviously obliged, because I don't want to make him uncomfortable.  The weird thing is, he just went back to *not* being gay.  He continued hooking up with girls, talked about girls, etc.  So all of our friends were a little confused, but we didn't want to push the subject.

Fast forward another two weeks.  He sends out *another* drunk message, coming out again.  This time, he was like ""It's for real this time, it's ok if you want to stop being my friend, etc.""  Again, we tried to be nice and cool about it and reassure him it was ok and we're there for him.  And **again**, the next day, he was like ""I don't want to talk about it, act like it never happened.""  And he hooks up with girls and the cycle continues.

Finally, when we were drunk one night, he finally brought it up and admitted that he liked guys.  I asked him if he was bi, and he said, ""No, I don't like girls.  I only like guys.""  I thought I finally got through to him and that we could just act normally again, but lo and behold, next time we're all sober, he refuses to talk about it.  I don't know what more we can do.  We offered to go to gay bars with him, we try to say supportive things to him when appropriate, we do everything we can to make him understand that it's not a big deal, but he won't budge.

The thing that is getting me annoyed is that now he's going on and on about the girl he just met, saying shit like ""Oh, this is the girl I am going to marry.""  I want to smack him and just say, ""Will you fucking cut it out?  I know you're gay, you apparently know you're gay, why do we have to keep up this ridiculous straight charade?  Just fuck dudes and own it.""

Anyway, advice would be appreciated.  I haven't had to go through this experience before, so I want to handle it well.  At the same time, I am starting to get irritated, because we've done as much as we could to help him out and feel accepted, and he keeps pulling this shit.  Every time he goes on another of his dramatic ""I'm secretly gay, ditch me as a friend if you want to, I'd understand"" rants, I want to punch him in the face.  ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all, I hope if it&amp;#39;s ok that a not gay person is posting on this sub...not sure about the rules, but it seemed like the most appropriate place to post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A really good friend of mine recently came out as gay (kinda).  We are all 23, by the way.  Basically one night when he was really drunk, he came out to our group of friends over a Facebook message.  He also said weird stuff in the message, like &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s ok if you don&amp;#39;t want to be my friend anymore.&amp;quot;  We all said that was awesome, we support you, we&amp;#39;re all still gonna be buds, etc.  I was surprised, but I also kind of realized there were signs all along and we just missed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the next day I brought it up to him, and he just said, &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t want to talk about it.&amp;quot;  Cut me off immediately and said he wanted to change the subject.  I obviously obliged, because I don&amp;#39;t want to make him uncomfortable.  The weird thing is, he just went back to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; being gay.  He continued hooking up with girls, talked about girls, etc.  So all of our friends were a little confused, but we didn&amp;#39;t want to push the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward another two weeks.  He sends out &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; drunk message, coming out again.  This time, he was like &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s for real this time, it&amp;#39;s ok if you want to stop being my friend, etc.&amp;quot;  Again, we tried to be nice and cool about it and reassure him it was ok and we&amp;#39;re there for him.  And &lt;strong&gt;again&lt;/strong&gt;, the next day, he was like &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t want to talk about it, act like it never happened.&amp;quot;  And he hooks up with girls and the cycle continues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, when we were drunk one night, he finally brought it up and admitted that he liked guys.  I asked him if he was bi, and he said, &amp;quot;No, I don&amp;#39;t like girls.  I only like guys.&amp;quot;  I thought I finally got through to him and that we could just act normally again, but lo and behold, next time we&amp;#39;re all sober, he refuses to talk about it.  I don&amp;#39;t know what more we can do.
