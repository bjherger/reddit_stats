I instigated the fight over something stupid, that I had no business interfering with. I sent him an apology a few weeks ago asking for forgiveness. I haven't heard anything back from him.

It didn't help that I was under significant outside stress from other personal issues, and financial issues.  I tried apologizing, but he wouldn't accept my apology.

I honestly don't know how I feel about him right now. I was in love with him, but now I only want to support him. I would be happy if he finds someone else to love. I want to be there for him when it goes bad, and be there for him when he finds his true love. I want to be there at his wedding, at his graduation, etc.

I don't want to lose his friendship forever. I know similar things have happened between some of my other friends (minus the whole love thing) where they don't speak for months (or even a year in one case), but eventually they are forgiven. I know he is slow to forgive and I hit a sensitive nerve, but I do want to make amends if possible

I don't know how to approach this. I can't figure out if I should view it as an ex or an estranged friend. before this He was always glad I was there to talk to him about things, and he was always glad I had stuck around as a friend after dating him didn't work out (we went on only a few dates).

I just don't know what to do.  I miss him, and he was some one I valued.  I still spend a lot of time trying to figure out how to make amends, but I don't know where to start.  I don't know if I am obsessing over a lost cause.  I tend to take friendship problems poorly if I know I caused them.

However, lately I've shifted into almost a total bottom in what feels like a really short time frame, but it goes further than that.

I'm not even entirely sure what triggered it, but I went from enjoying more sensual fucking (face to face) to liking getting pinned face-down and fucked. What caught my attention (hence this post) was about a week ago where a new feeling came over me while getting fucked; I felt myself let go and the thought of just being 'used' by him was so pleasing. I felt less like a person and more like an object, if that makes sense? My BF has certainly caught on and we've talked about it, and while I didn't used to before, I like being called a ""cock whore"" or ""slut"" while getting fucked (at my request, surprisingly, as I wasn't like that before). These new feelings have also lead to me wanting a threesome and I've shared those fantasies with him, which he's on board for (I definitely want a dick in both ends). [Just for fun, this is a pretty good summary of what I'd like. :p](http://www.pornhub.com/view_video.php?viewkey=535267727)

I just wanted to know if anyone else has seen or experienced something similar and if you get through it what steps did you take.

My parents are 63(D) and 55(M) and have been together for 35 years. For the last few years (3-5) around when my younger brother fully moved out their relationship has been getting progressively worse. My mother is constantly crying and not eating and my father is looking older and worse every single time I see him. He says he has to work for a few more years but I honestly don't know how they will survive it.

With out going into specific details they seem to be completely incapable of talking to each other and making peace. My mother gets emotional and cries and lays blame and my father shuts everything off or has too many drinks. He is also frequently exhausted having worked all day (He's a doctor) and coming home to my mother being emotional. 

I honestly suspect it might have something to do with my Mother going through menopause. She seems to have random bursts of irrationality and is incredibly paranoid that my father is having an affair. She reads situations wrong and is incapable of rationally or non-emotionally coping. This really is the major issue as it makes working through and discussing the little issues impossible. 

Her being incapable of rationally coping causes her to overreact and my father, who is very non-confrontational, to simply shut off. 

I have tried counselling them through it myself but I just am not able to do it and it honestly leaves me feeling empty, nauseous, and helpless. 

Has anyone else had similar issues, not only with older parents fight but specifically with emotional changes etc?

Hey bros! I'm an uncle to many wonderful nieces and nephews,so I'm privy to the usual antics of these kids, but since they're getting older some issues such as boys, girdles, dates and so on have come up.  

My sister came to me concerned about her eldest son being gay. She's fine with the whole issue after I came out but like any parent, is worried about potential bullying/heartbreak/hormonal sh*t teens go through when they come out. He's 13, living in the same rural town I grew in, and going into high school next year. She wants me to have the ""talk"" with him since I came out the same age as he did, and frankly....I'm not sure how to start this off. (Hand puppets? Charades? Listen to the colours of the wind?)


So any suggestions bros??
