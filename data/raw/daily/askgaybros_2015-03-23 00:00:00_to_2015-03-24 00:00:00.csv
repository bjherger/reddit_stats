I read the reddiquette, so trying my best here. 

Context: I’m ending my college career, and I've accomplished a lot in terms of coming out to my friends and family, developing my sexuality, and dealing with my own internalized homophobia. I'm from a heterogeneous suburb going to a smallish liberal arts college where I'm in a fraternity, have two majors, and great group of supportive friends/brothers. However, it seems in my more intimate personal life that I haven't made any substantial progress.

The Problem: In high school before I was out, I would mostly just have crushes on my various straight bro-friends, and not deal with it and pretend they didn't happen. In college, every year or so I would find a great guy who was gay or bisexual, also in a fraternity, into sports, socially active, and we would hookup and become good friends. The issue is that all of these guys were in closet, and even though I would still hookup with out, gay guys, I've never felt strong romantic feelings for anyone but the four closeted gaybros. 

In one case, the dude and I started dating during the summer for a few months until we came back to school when he unexpectedly dumped me. In another instance, the dude and I went to different schools, but we managed to make the long distance thing work (45 min. commute) for a year and a half before he dumped me. These relationships are consistently ended by the other party on the premise of them not being ready to come out and therefore not wanting to date anymore. Unfortunately, even though I am aware that this is an internal issue that doesn't reflect what they think of me, my self esteem always drops, and I think I'm not good enough when I get rejected by these closet cases and go through about half a year of being depressed and suicidal before repeating the cycle again.

Current Situation: So after being dumped by my closeted boyfriend of 15 months, I've been feeling really angry and bitter about how disappointing these interactions have been. And now I'm once again getting involved with another super awesome, coolest-guy-at-school, closeted gaybro. I feel like I have this new vendetta against closet cases, and I do a lot of closet case shaming where I'm outing my sexual partners behind their backs to my fraternity and friends for fun and to keep me from thinking of them as people that I could develop feelings for. I don't like myself for hooking up with closet cases, because I feel like I'm perpetuating their bad behavior by sharing with them gay experiences while depriving them of the social and public consequences that I have to deal with everyday. I justify this terrible outing/shaming behavior by saying that if given the chance, these selfish guys would just use me and then dump me and move on and forget about me and pretend it never happened when they got bored because they are too cowardly to man-up and come out and deal with the potential negative consequences from the ignorant, bigoted people whose opinions they care about for some reason. 

Now, I know what I’m doing is wrong, and I know that outing someone is incredibly devastating to them emotionally in addition of depriving them of the opportunity to come out on their own. When I don’t know their personal consequences of potentially losing their economic security from their parents or being put in physical harm, so obviously what I am doing is immoral. So I’m asking the community and maybe any closeted guys if they can explain what’s going on from their perspective so I can empathize with them and stop feeling so angry and victimized. My dad supports my behavior saying that it’s sad when he meets older gentlemen who seemed to have stifled their intimacy that maybe all they needed was a push during their youth. My mom is pretty negative of what I’m doing, but she also dated a closeted gay guy for a long time (at the same college even!), and I guess sympathizes more with their situation. 

My Questions: In my mind, I don't understand how you can be in the closet and still justify being with someone else physically or romantically. When I came out, part of the reason I felt ready was because I wanted to solve any internal issues before inviting someone else into the mix. Another reason I came out was because I saw a lot of homophobia in my fraternity and among my friends, and I knew I could do a lot of good by being the first gay bro-friend to a lot of these people. So how do closet cases justify not being able to speak out when their friends act homophobic when they know they could be providing these people with a positive gay role model? Also, why is hooking up with someone consistently and developing a romance with someone who could out you at any time worth the risk? Are you trying to get someone to justify your choices and accept your closetness or your homosexuality? Wouldn’t it be easier to just use a hookup app and forgo any emotional attachment?

I told him I'll give it a shot but he needs to know that he's giving up the typical America life with kids and a white picket fence. Which he said adoption is our next bet and he is ok as long as I keep making him his after sex sandwich (inside joke between us because his hook girls always did that for him and I'm not about that life). He admitted the only reason why he came to visit was to see if he was certain about his sexuality and he said he was. He later gave me a promise ring and asked if I wanted to make it Facebook official. I didn't want the ring because I told him I didn't need a ring for this type of commitment nor did I want to make it Facebook official because my job company is pretty conservative. He was kinda sad I didn't want the ring so I said fuck it and wore it. We woke up so hangover and it was kinda weird to hear him say morning babe for the first time and hold me tight to his body. Never cuddled with him sober. It was a pretty awesome weekend with the dude and interesting he changed his fb status to in a relationship right after he left where I'm probably just gonna leave my private.

I'm 25, and I've never posted anything this personal on reddit before.  5 years ago I was raped.  It was during a hookup, the guy got far too aggressive with me and did things I wasn't comfortable with.  After that, I started seeing a therapist, went through some major depression, and started having sex again about 6 months after it happened.

But the problem that I'm experiencing, even 5 years later, is that I can't bottom without flashing back.  Even with people I'm in a relationship with, I get scared, freak out, and make things stop.  Normally this isn't a problem - I just top if I'm hooking up with someone, and with people that I know very well I've been able to explain the situation.

Two things have kind of prompted my fears, and made me want to seek out advice.

1) I hooked up with a guy yesterday who I've hooked up with once before.  He started to try topping me, even after I had specifically told him that I didn't want to.  We were in the heat of things, and I just started to go with it, but after about a minute I had to push him off me.  I just started to flash back, and it was scary, and uncomfortable, and worrying.

2) A guy that I've been pursuing romantically was talking with me about this issue on the phone.  We're not together, but we've been dancing around it for a long time.  Because of our jobs, we travel a lot, and we're never in the same place at the same time where we can start a real thing.  He knows all about my past, and I was telling him about #1 from above.  He asked me if I ever thought I could get past it, and I said no.  He and I are going to soon be in the same place at the same time, where we've talked about trying to start something, and he's a top.  I'm worried that because of what happened to me, I won't be able to pursue a relationship with him the way I want to.

Reddit.  Help me.  What do I do in this situation?  I'm just not sure what to do or how to help things go, so any advice would be appreciated.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi reddit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m 25, and I&amp;#39;ve never posted anything this personal on reddit before.  5 years ago I was raped.  It was during a hookup, the guy got far too aggressive with me and did things I wasn&amp;#39;t comfortable with.  After that, I started seeing a therapist, went through some major depression, and started having sex again about 6 months after it happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the problem that I&amp;#39;m experiencing, even 5 years later, is that I can&amp;#39;t bottom without flashing back.  Even with people I&amp;#39;m in a relationship with, I get scared, freak out, and make things stop.  Normally this isn&amp;#39;t a problem - I just top if I&amp;#39;m hooking up with someone, and with people that I know very well I&amp;#39;ve been able to explain the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

I recently starting seeing a guy at my university; I'm a 22 y/o senior, he's a 22 y/o first-year masters student.  We've been on a few dates, and I'm looking to seriously pursue a relationship.  Tonight, he told me that he was HIV+, and he's currently being medicated for it.  I'm HIV-, I want to try to make things work with this guy, but obviously there are things that I need to keep in mind to make sure it's a healthy relationship for both of us.  I started my own research, but there's a lot of information out there, and not all of it is easy to process.  I've got a few thoughts and some questions, and I'd really love some feedback to make sure my facts are straight, as well as some advice for my questions.

What I know:

* He's actively taking medicine for it, although I don't know yet if he's ""undetectable"" or not.

* Condoms are a must whenever I bottom during anal sex.

* Since I have first aid training, be cautious if I need to treat any of his bleeding wounds.

* Blood, semen, and pre-cum are the things I need to be concerned about being in contact with.  The rest of his body, including saliva and tears, I don't need to worry about.

* PrEP is something I need to look into.


Questions:

* Am I correct in assuming that condoms should also be used any time I'm topping during anal sex?  Assuming this becomes a monogamous relationship; obviously, use them in a non-monogamous relationship.

* What is the risk of contracting HIV from oral sex, both receiving and giving?

* What exactly is an ""undetectable load,"" and how is it determined? Is it something that we should re-address on a regular basis, or is it consistent after it's been diagnosed as ""undetectable?""

* What is the best way of looking into PrEP, as someone without a primary care physician, and how expensive is it for an American college student who is still on parent's insurance?

* If things go well and a relationship develops, what can I do to be a strong support pillar?  Even if things don't develop, what can I do to be a support for people with HIV in general?


Feel free to chip in any additional information that you think would be pertinent.  I don't have a whole lot of knowledge yet, and I would gladly welcome anything that would be good to know.  Many thanks in advance!

I've been seeing this guy for a while now... (Since November, but really only started ""dating"" according to him since about January, but that's a different story...) Things I thought were progressing, granted I would have liked to have kissed at least by now, but that's beside the point now. On Friday, we were out on a date, and I get a text from my ex and now friend saying that he saw my date on Grindr, and that he actually sent a message to our (my ex and I's) mutual friend over Growlr, while we were on our date! 

I'm not sure what to think about it. On the one hand, we haven't ever discussed exclusivity, and according to him we're not at boyfriend level yet, but I feel like I may not be getting the whole picture from him either. My friends think I should break it off now, because I deserve better and that he's not really serious. My date tells me that he's just not sure what he wants right now, but knows he likes me and wants to see where things go. And me? I just want somebody to love and kiss and have fun with (sexually and non). 

What's the best way to go about all this? Am I rationalizing it too much in my head or is he not entirely serious? 

EDIT: Thanks for the responses. I think I will talk to him about how I am wanting something more than what he's comfortable doing at the moment.

I was out drinking with friends in central London; Harry approached me quite timidly and attempted to flirt with me which I found adorable. I gave him my number and did not think anything of it. 

In the morning, I was greeted by a text from Harry inviting me out for a coffee at Starbucks, which I accepted as I thought what harm could it honestly do. The following weeks were much the same, and we got along greatly in the end Harry asked if we could be exclusive which I agreed to as I had grown to find him quite attractive.

Okay... it's the past couple weeks which have been most revealing and has left me with no idea of how I feel or where I take things from here. 
Harry as far as I knew at the time grew up in London, but was not very specific with details just saying around the central London area which could have been anywhere, to be honest. 

I started to notice over time that Harry was very vague with details when it came to personal things about what school he went to, and what his parents did or even what he did as a job. Harry would often stay over at my place, but not once did Harry invite me over to his place and when I asked he told me it had a damp problem due to a burst water pipe. 

I was starting to become very irritated as it became clearer and clearer he was hiding things from me because he was so vague in responses, and started to trip up on a couple of things. In the end, I told him I feel very uneasy with his vague answers and started to doubt the relationship which seemed to upset him really to the point he stormed off outside of my apartment. 

I did not hear anything until Friday when I received a phone call from a lady claiming to be Harrys mother explaining that they're holding a surprise birthday party!! I had no idea it was his birthday and felt completely awful and at the same time even more annoyed because he did not bother to tell me. 

I politely accepted the invitation, and she explained she would arrange a taxi to pick me up that evening and that I was to wear something smart, but casual. It's here when things start to get even more interesting, and why I have ended up creating a throwaway to ask for advice.

The taxi pulls up outside my outside my apartment, and as I climb into the car low and behold Harry is sat in the back seat! I was thinking this dude had to be fucking with me, and I started to think the lady claiming to be his mother must have been one of his friends. 

Harry starts apologising profusely telling me he has been hiding things from me, and I burst into tears thinking he has been cheating on me all this time. Harry is quick to reassure me that he would never cheat on me, but was not sure about to bring up a subject with me.

It turns out his mother found out about me and wanted to invite me over so she could meet me so she thought his birthday would be a good way to do that. The driver informs us we have arrived at Belgravia.... BELGRAVIA!?!?!? FUCKING BELGRAVIA!!!? Belgravia is one of the wealthiest districts in London! I was completely shocked, and at the same time very angry he would hide something as big as this from me! I told him to get out of the taxi, and instructed the taxi driver to take me home. It's been a couple of days since, and Harry has texted me a number of times asking me to let him explain things, but I am just not sure what to do or how to take things from here? I've let him know I'll call him tomorrow morning first thing, and he said he would like that very much... I am just not sure what I am going to tell him or how to process this information. Does anyone have any advice at all? I think ultimately I am worried about the fact I have just enough money to by living pay cheque to pay cheque, and Harry or his family will end up thinking if I continue to be with him I am just after money which won't be the case as I did not know about any of this until Friday just gone, and we'd been dating for eight months previous. I want to be with him, but not his money. I don't want him paying for things or taking me to fancy places.

TL;DR - I meet my current boyfriend Harry, and we have been dating for 8 months so far. He's been very vague the past 8 months about his personal life, and Friday I get invited to his birthday to find out he lives in Belgravia one of the richest districts in London...

My boyfriend just confessed to me he has some suicidal feelings. And it crushed me. I know he had his issues in the past, and that sometimes he can get very depressed or down. But most of the time I helped him get over it and he got positive again.

But tonight he told me that he is sick of feeling depressed and want to give it one last shot. When those depressed feelings come back, he will make an end to it. I panicked, I told him he couldn't do this to me. That I would do anything I could to help him, just like I did before.

But he told me he made his decision and there is nothing I can do about it. when it comes back he told me he will call me to say goodbye and that this will be it. He says it would be too difficult to at least give me a chance to help him and get together.

He went to doctors and psychologists but nothing could help him. I'm feeling helpless. I don't know what to do. I'm just crying and I can't stop crying. What if I go to work tomorrow and he calls me saying he's sick of it. He told me he is feeling great now, but I know that those feelings can change over a night. So I can't feel at ease anymore.

Here’s the sitch: I’m about to turn 27 and have never had 1) A network of (or really any, for that matter) gay friends, and 2) A meaningful romantic relationship. Obviously, it’s got me down.

To add to the feelingses, I’ve been living in the Boston Area (Somerville) for grad school since the beginning of the school year, and I don’t have any friends outside of my program, none of whom are gay anyway. The close friends that I do have are both in my program and women. Grad school, I’m finding, is a generally lonely place with a lot of time spent alone doing homework. As I type that previous sentence, it reads to me like both an excuse and a huge understatement. 

Look, I know and accept that everyone is on their own timeline, and I have traditionally been more of a late bloomer anyway. Its just especially hard as another birthday approaches and that a bunch of my friends are getting engaged/married or securing long-term relationships. So, my questions are as follows:

1. Generally as an adult, how does one even go about making friends? Like actually. I have no idea how to do it outside of school.
2. How do I escape this vicious cycle of loneliness-&gt;introverting-&gt;not having friends?

I’ve known him for six months but we have been going out for three months. He had never been in a relationship before. Naturally, he is very innocent and very attached to me, but it feels like he’s being increasingly suffocating. 

He is very secure and mature around other people, which is one of the reasons I liked him when we started dating. However, the dynamic in our relationship is completely different: He:

1. Very rarely voices out his opinions because he’s scared I will disapprove of them. 
2. He asks me what I’m thinking very often.
He apologizes for everything. It’s a huge turnoff for me, but he’s already told me that that’s the way he is. 
3. When we’re together at my place or his he wants to make out/cuddle the ENTIRE time.
4. He does not criticize me, or if he does, he’ll just say ‘just kidding’ and nervously laugh it off.
5. Tells me he loves me every hour and expects a response every time. (Excessive need for validation)

All these things are pushing me away when I’m around him, and I think he’s noticing that and doubling down on his efforts (see points 1-5). I know I have a tendency to stonewall people when I’m uncomfortable with them, and I’m aware that I haven’t been open about how these things are bothering me, but I feel like it’s just who he is as a person, and I can’t ask him to change for me.

I feel like I don’t love him as much as he loves me. The spark I felt from the beginning is gone already (3 months in). I feel little to no desire to initiate texting or reply to him when he texts me. I see spending each weekend with him as kind of an imposition. Every time we kiss I find it to be more and more of a chore. I hate feeling like this because I liked the image he projected before we got in a relationship. Now that we’re together, it’s become very clear that he is too emotionally dependent on me.

He is a great person and has a kind heart, and he has never been through a breakup before, so I feel bad about having to put him through something like that. I don’t want to crush this man. I just feel like we are great friends and compatible in most aspects, but I can’t see myself being in a long term relationship with this kind of codependency. 

**If you’ve been on either side of this situation before, is there anything I should think about that really helped you?**

TL;DR BF is very in love with me, and exhibits codependent behavior towards me. I don’t think I’m at his level.

EDIT: Fixed numbering.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ll keep it short: We are both in our mid 20s. I’ve known him for six months but we have been going out for three months. He had never been in a relationship before. Naturally, he is very innocent and very attached to me, but it feels like he’s being increasingly suffocating. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is very secure and mature around other people, which is one of the reasons I liked him when we started dating. However, the dynamic in our relationship is completely different: He:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very rarely voices out his opinions because he’s scared I will disapprove of them. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He asks me what I’m thinking very often.
He apologizes for everything. It’s a huge turnoff for me, but he’s already told me that that’s the way he is. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When we’re together at my place or his he wants to make out/cuddle the ENTIRE time.&lt;/li&gt;

I know I said it was painful, but here is the best way I know to describe the feeling: you know how when a cat licks your skin, it's not exactly a pleasant feeling because of their sandpaper tongues. Well, it kinda felt like that. And I think he may have been misinterpreting some of my grunts of pain as grunts of pleasure. I ended up just jacking off to finish while he sucked on my head. I really don't think he was accidentally using teeth or anything. I always thought that I would probably last seconds my first time, but I'm not sure he was ever going to get me off with things going as they were. But I still felt like I was letting him down.

I think the only thing I know to do is to communicate better to let him know what feels good and what doesn't. He's told me that his favorite thing to do sexually is give BJs, so I feel like I really need to get past this.
