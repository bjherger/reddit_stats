I had sensed tension in the relationship for a while- slowly starting to realize some of our incompatibilities, but it was my first relationship so I kind of tried to work through them or look past them. I still really liked him, though

There was a lot of tension and bickering on the trip. Some of his habits really bothered me and made me tense and I guess some of my habits bothered him. He got really distant after the trip- 2 days later I saw him out on a date with another guy.

We met for coffee the next day. He said he thought I was too high strung on the trip and it bothered him and he asked if we could scale the relationship back- keep it more casual and see each other less. I told him flat out that I couldn't do that. I needed to erase him from my life for a while to be able to move on. I think it caught him by surprise and he got sort of emotional (cried a little). The rest of the conversation was amicable but sad, and a little tense as we aired out some grievances.

I don't really know where to start. So I'm going to make this really readable. At least, I've written this so many times but this seems to make the most sense.

Valentine's Day, 2015.

My boyfriend has been at his friend Marcos' since two days before the 14th.

On the 14th we planned to hang out and spend some time together after a quick date. However, he never talks to me when he's at a friend's house.

So I go to work and message him to let me know when he's home. I go on break and see he hasn't responded so I message him to please walk to my work and try to be here around 11:45 (it's about 30 minutes but we do it all the time because we can't drive).

I get off break and go work the rest of my shift. So my shift ends and he hasn't responded but I have no ride home so I have to wait for him to respond. I wait about 5 hours, it's about 5:30 by now. I haven't eaten lunch because I waited for him so I get Chipotle. At 6 I'm done eating.

My manager comes and says he can give me a ride home and he does so. I get home and break down, because I hate how my boyfriend ignores me when he's at a friends house. I hate that I feel like I'm the only one trying, I'm the only one who pays for dates, the only one who gives him gifts. 

At around 10 I call up my friend Enrique and tell him let's go out to eat. I didn't want to ruin my valentine's day. After that we hang for a bit and then I vent to Enrique about Kris (my boyfriend). 

Enrique and I talk and then I get the first phonecall. Kris is missing and nobody knows where he's at. His friend he's supposed to be with asks me to look for him. It's about midnight now. 

I don't look for him, thinking it's just a joke or they're covering up for him since Kris has cheated on me before and maybe he did it again or something stupid happened. 

I sigh and talk more to Enrique, we agree to just wait. I get a call a bit later that they've found Kris' body and his suicide note.

His parents tell me to come over to read the note, and I do so. They refuse to let me see the note and I just leave because they tell me I should go.

They ignore me after this and never talk to me again. Their son tells me the note said that Kris stated, that I cheated on him twice and I'm a manipulative bitch. That I shouldn't be allowed to go to his funeral or be allowed near his body or anywhere near that place. 

And here I am now. Its been a month. I'm not sure if I wrote this for advice or for true help. The title says it all. I'm really just crying right now as I try and figure out everything again in my head. I don't know what to believe or what to do. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well.

&lt;p&gt;Valentine&amp;#39;s Day, 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My boyfriend has been at his friend Marcos&amp;#39; since two days before the 14th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the 14th we planned to hang out and spend some time together after a quick date. However, he never talks to me when he&amp;#39;s at a friend&amp;#39;s house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I go to work and message him to let me know when he&amp;#39;s home. I go on break and see he hasn&amp;#39;t responded so I message him to please walk to my work and try to be here around 11:45 (it&amp;#39;s about 30 minutes but we do it all the time because we can&amp;#39;t drive).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get off break and go work the rest of my shift. So my shift ends and he hasn&amp;#39;t responded but I have no ride home so I have to wait for him to respond. I wait about 5 hours, it&amp;#39;s about 5:30 by now. I haven&amp;#39;t eaten lunch because I waited for him so I get Chipotle. At 6 I&amp;#39;m done eating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My manager comes and says he can give me a ride home and he does so. I get home and break down, because I hate how my boyfriend ignores me when he&amp;#39;s at a friends house. I hate that I feel like I&amp;#39;m the only one trying, I&amp;#39;m the only one who pays for dates, the only one who gives him gifts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At around 10 I call up my friend Enrique and tell him let&amp;#39;s go out to eat. I didn&amp;#39;t want to ruin my valentine&amp;#39;s day. After that we hang for a bit and then I vent to Enrique about Kris (my boyfriend). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enrique and I talk and then I get the first phonecall. Kris is missing and nobody knows where he&amp;#39;s at. His friend he&amp;#39;s supposed to be with asks me to look for him. It&amp;#39;s about midnight now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t look for him, thinking it&amp;#39;s just a joke or they&amp;#39;re covering up for him since Kris has cheated on me before and maybe he did it again or something stupid happened. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sigh and talk more to Enrique, we agree to just wait. I get a call a bit later that they&amp;#39;ve found Kris&amp;#39; body and his suicide note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His parents tell me to come over to read the note, and I do so. They refuse to let me see the note and I just leave because they tell me I should go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They ignore me after this and never talk to me again. Their son tells me the note said that Kris stated, that I cheated on him twice and I&amp;#39;m a manipulative bitch. That I shouldn&amp;#39;t be allowed to go to his funeral or be allowed near his body or anywhere near that place. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here I am now. Its been a month. I&amp;#39;m not sure if I wrote this for advice or for true help. The title says it all. I&amp;#39;m really just crying right now as I try and figure out everything again in my head. I don&amp;#39;t know what to believe or what to do. &lt;/p&gt;

I try to return the favor by hanging out, he's a foreigner so sometimes I'll take him to do fun stuff like bowling and I'll pay because he helps me out so much.

However, the other day I had a really shitty sexual encounter and I'm just wondering if it's technically sexual assault. 

So I'm 17 and I was shopping late at night when I got a scruff message from an older guy near by. He told me to come over and I obviously obliged since I'm 17 and horny as fuck. I get there and he smells a bit like he's been drinking but I go into his bedroom anyway. To spare you too many details we were making out and he told me to sit on his dick, I said I didnt want to bottom that night and he was pissed and kept saying ""cmon, you know you want me to explode in you"" (the main reason I didn't want to bottom was because he obviously was into bareback). I should have left then but I was stupid and horny and stayed. He really wanted to rim me so I just sort of let him do it and all of a sudden he put a finger in me after I told him I didn't want to do anal. I was too uncomfortable to tell him to stop and I even fake moaned like I liked it. Finally he stopped and said he wanted to cuddle but then kept putting his dick between my ass cheeks and was begging for me to ""push out my hole and let him in"" I practically had to block my asshole from his dick. I finally just ran the fuck out of there and blocked him on scruff. 

I know it all sounds fucked up but I'm totally fine and I'm just curious if this is classified as assault even though I never really said no. Sorry about the gross details.

They showed this segment with 2 guys and 2 girls discussing who should pay for the bill during a date. Both the women said it was the man's responsibility and that the woman viewed this as a sign he was strong and could Provide. Both the men basically said if they didn't pay then there'd be no second date and thus, no pussy.

I watched this and thought back on my experiances. In all of my first dates, I've paid. In all of my second dates, my boyfriend paid. From there on it usually alternated or we'd just pay our own way.

I'm not condemning what he's doing. If this is what he gets off to, fine. What *does* worry me is the fact that he's giving out his phone number publicly, and that he wants this picture of him passed around. He also has a girlfriend, which complicates things, but isn't my concern. I'm worried that these pent-up feelings are leading him to make decisions that he's going to regret. 

How do I approach this with him? I want to make it clear to him that I'm not judging him for what he's doing; minus the cross dressing, I'm into really kinky stuff myself, so I understand his desires and fantasies. I want to provide someone he can talk to about his feelings, because I seriously doubt he has anyone to talk to. And I want him to make sure he's being safe-- both about STIs and making this sort of thing public.

Now I feel a bit guilty about teasing him for not drinking whenever we go out and always eating ""healthy foods only"" as opossed to snack foods, etc. If I'd known the situation prior, I would've definitely been way less insensitive. So now I'm just wondering how exactly I can be a good friend to him now that I know? Should I cut back on inviting him to more physically taxing things such as hiking trips, gym, etc.? What kind of foods should I recommend we grab for lunch? (and which ones shouldn't I?) How emotionally sensitive should I be? What topics should I avoid and which ones should I pursue? How should I approach the topic of HIV itself, or should I just avoid it altogether?

I've come to realize just how new this is for me. Looking forward to reading your responses. Thanks in advance!

EDIT: Thanks everyone for all of the excellent responses! And to those who took the question negatively, I honestly didn't at all mean to offend with my lack of knowledge on the topic, and I apologize if I did. Though I believe I did make my ignorance on the subject quite clear (hence my whole reason for asking the question to begin with ;)

I'm aware that HIV treatments aren't as archaic as they used to be, what with all of the advancements that have happened in medicine and that individuals living with the condition can live long, happy and healthy lives. I wasn't at all implying that the disease would make my friend automatically sickly and bedridden. I will say that he does complain about severe headaches from time to time and it's at those times that I'm at a loss as to how I can help him (if at all). I see now that the best thing I can do is to properly educate myself on the illness and all of the factors and variables that accompany it. Besides that, as several of you mentioned, just continue to be a friend to him and not to treat him any differently because of it. I already told him that I love him like a little brother and that I'll always be there for him no matter what and if he ever needs anything to let me know.

Should i try and turn him into a bottom? he doesnt seem to like the idea


I want to start saying I have scoured old threads from askgaybros, gaybros, and other random internet sources for anything on the topic of small penises. usually it fills up with ""motion of the ocean"" stuff; which is solid advice in theory; but its not working for me.

Basically; Story starts on a dating site. I put that I'm 100% bottom; into rough and kinky stuff. I get a message from this really Dom sounding top; and we instantly hit it off with a lot of shared interests. Things go amazing; and second date we decide to fool around a bit. 

We know where it ends up; he packs 3"". And I'm not even that shallow. My Ex of 5 years was only 5.5"" and I absoloutley loved it. I pack a true 8"" myself; so i honestly don't really care about partners dick size; I'm not chasing huge because I already know its nothing special. In every single way, I though I was an accepting an non-shallow person. 

But to list the details in bullet form; here are the details I can't get past.

- why in gods name is a 3"" man a 100% top? who allowed this? who unhealthily stoked his ego into thinking he should be a top? he is living a life of disappointing every sexual partner; where if he would just bottom he wouldnt ever dissapoint. I've seen threads about ""if I'm small do I have to bottom"" and the honest answer is yes. there is nothing more dissapointing to a bottom than a small dick; why is it our responsibility to console and pretend its not borderline micro-penis?  I feel so cheated by the universe, that this masc, dom, 100% top is hiding 3"".

- Its also uncut; and not cleaned great. like he probably showered at 8am; but its Already 2am the next day dude.... and maybe someone else has experienced this; but uncut dicks that are small; it just feels like loose, dead skin; which stacks on top of the nagging sense of pedophelia having a 3"" dick in mouth. 

- the head of his dick is rough; like sand paper. its like just the tip once got dried out like a sponge; and now has the consistency of an old man. after even a few seconds of blowing; my mouth feels scratchy; sandpapery; and repulsive. and that rough sensation is one I try to ignore while also ignoring his unwashed, uncut dick; and a penis that hardly makes and sensation for me. I used to have an oral obsession; I rate oral way above anal; all I ever wanted with partners was rough deep throating. But I'm realizing my fantasies will never ever be fulfilled with this sandpapery baby carrot. I wish i didn't come off as mean. But he's the one being 100% top. I feel shitty now that I like him; but am incredibly repulsed by his dick.

- I feel like he faked his personality; and faked our ""connection"" just to try and attract ANY boyfriend; I feel like he's being extremely fake to make up for his dick. he tried to have sex first date; he told me he liked me on first date; and did kissing; necking; and nearly hickies on first date.I didn't see it at first but he has a terrible case of compensating with EVERYTHING(mainly ego)

- he kisses like a fucking fish. its 80% tongue and 20% teeth(yes, clinking against mine); and that's if I'm lucky enough that he stopped skippering my neck. oh, did I mention he smokes cigarettes? I feel like his slobbery, hicky attempts are also just his over-the-top attempt to lure me in. its like hes feigning love; and hoping I'm going to return the favor. He also just ki DA vacuums on my cock; and goes ecstatic like its the biggest he's ever seen; maybe it is; but I'm still bottom and not really trying to have my dick the primary focus.

this whole situation is hard because he is pushing the relationship as fast as he can; I was hoping to take it slow; see if i ever get enough emotional padding to forget about the fact that I will always prefer my toy collection over him. But since he is pushing it so fast; asking me to sleep over on 3rd date (we've had sex obv, but i don't want to sleep ober at your freaking moms house 3rd date for a walk of shame. Oh, did I mention first date he introduced me to his whole family? It just feels like hes trying to lock down ANY boyfriend; I get the sense he has been single a long time. 


Give me the truth gaybros. Am I a terrible person? or are you cringing as hard as in am right now? personally as a bottom; I think this guy should just 100% bottom; there is no shame in being a bottom; I can say that as a bottom. but why would be even want to live with penis size anxiety by being a top? I think his insecurity turned into this big macho personality; and now he's not willing to try the one thing that might keep me around (and if I hear 'its too big' about 8 again; I'm going to swear I'm the last real bottom left on earth. honestly only reason I'm 100% bottom is most gay guys are pussies; when they should just focus on being boypussies. stretching to 8 is not hard I use toys way bigger. Wondering if i should try and make him bottom. but I know I'm going to hear the same shit about my size, as if jackhammering a baby carrot makes more sense than stretching out for an idealized size.............

please no posts just saying ""motion of the ocean"" I'll give you $50 if you could suck this smelly, sandpapery 3"" without barfing. Size does matter; a relationship without sexual desire and fantasy is so empty. After seeing all the other threads on reddit, full of overly optimistic answers; I'm wondering if one real gaybro out there can feel my pain? Why universe; I liked this guy. Why the hell couldn't he even be 5""? I would praise a 5"" like a god. I don't hate small dicks. I just think its unfair for them to be 100% top. Being a top is saying ""Hey, I'll fill you with dick"" don't lie about it if you actually can't *fill* someone with dick. Just be a bottom, easy as that.

should I dump him? should I give him an ultimatum on being a bottom? even dildos won't really help because I have an oral fixation. I'm really frustrated at the universe for teasing me with a guy who is perfect in every aspect; besides sexually. and as an extremely horny young guy who jacks it at least 3x per day......I just know bottoming for him won't ever work. I'm still mostly bottom, but I could see myself topping; it would be more fun than.....this.... 

Have fun down voting me! I'm trying to not hurt this guy because I like him; but hey, this was my gut reaction to a small penis.  I know smaller guys are going to hate reading this. just understand my advice "" all small gays should be bottoms"" is the opinion of a power bottom who is well hung. There is no shame in bottoming. in my opinion its more fun. But its honestly almost lying being a top with under 5"". people expect a ""top"" to be able to rock your world. or at least have a usable penis. if you don't have a usable penis, No sweat! just be a bottom and continue to rock peoples worlds! but small tops are a HUGE disappointment; I feel like its almost time to just clear the air of these optimistic lies once and for all. Small guys, should all be bottoms. Its bad enough I have to filter out tops. I shouldn't have to filter out tops who are lying to themselves about being able to please others as a top.

its time for an actual honest discussion about small penises; especially in the gay community where there actually is an alternate option available to the less endowed. Small straight men never get this freedom.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;TLDR; new date has 3&amp;quot; ; I really like him; have a lot of fun with him; but for some reason he is a 100% top.

But its honestly almost lying being a top with under 5&amp;quot;. people expect a &amp;quot;top&amp;quot; to be able to rock your world. or at least have a usable penis. if you don&amp;#39;t have a usable penis, No sweat! just be a bottom and continue to rock peoples worlds! but small tops are a HUGE disappointment; I feel like its almost time to just clear the air of these optimistic lies once and for all. Small guys, should all be bottoms. Its bad enough I have to filter out tops. I shouldn&amp;#39;t have to filter out tops who are lying to themselves about being able to please others as a top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;its time for an actual honest discussion about small penises; especially in the gay community where there actually is an alternate option available to the less endowed. Small straight men never get this freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

The first instance was with a girl who I met through a friend, and the topic of my love life (or lack there of) came up, so obviously she found out I was gay on the first night. After a couple instances of telling her how I felt about dating, months into our friendship I remember going to a party with her. I was drunk, and she says, ""Ethan! Come here! I want to introduce you to some friends of mine!"" As I was approaching, I overheard her say, ""you guys HAVE to meet my gay best friend"". I then asked her if I heard her correctly, and she had this guilty grin on her face. I thought to myself, ""well, I am too forward about my sexuality sometimes. Maybe I'm just shoving it in people's faces too much""

It was all fine until I had another encounter. One of my coworkers and I were talking about how we had a mutual friend (I knew this mutual friend for 7 years, and came out to her about 3 years ago), and my coworker was telling me about how this friend of ours was telling her about her ""gay best friend Ethan"". It was different this time around, because this is someone I've known for SEVEN freaking years. I only came out to her a few years ago. What about all the other years that I was friends with her and this had nothing to do with our friendship?

Anyhow, am I wrong for talking about my sexuality with my friends and then feeling frustrated for being labeled the gay best friend? I feel like I've become another tool or category on someone's belt of friendships. Even though I do talk about sex a lot (other reasons why), I don't like my sexuality being the depth of what everyone sees me as. I have other things from within me that are also part of who I am.

Yesterday we were talking about how our first date went and we both agreed we felt a something that day since the date went very well and we spent all day together till 6am of the next day. 

As we continued talking about this, I remembered that after our date I texted him a couple of times, but he never replied, which really made me feel shitty that weekend. So, I asked him why he did that. Hesitantly, he told me that after our first date, the following day he had a three day fling with another guy. According to him this was out of desperation and being lonely. 

Now, I knew I shouldn't have felt angry or sad about this, but I couldn't help to. I knew that nothing was established between me and him after our first date, but it really bothered me that he didn't tell me anything before. It made me question whether I could trust his decisions up to this point and whether what we have could be a fling too for him.

Am I wrong to feel the way I do? I know I shouldn't, but why do I?

But then she surprised me by telling me that one of her moms absolutely hates the idea of gay marriage, and considers marriage to be a straight concept. She went on to explain that her mom thinks that gays who want to get married are just trying to ""play straight"" and imitate straight couples. 

Personally, I've never heard of this kind of thinking from a gay person. I understand the rationale that marriage isn't for everybody, and that some gay people might never even want to get married, but that's not the same as actually being opposed to gay marriage. I also understand that marriage is traditionally a straight thing, but as a teenager, I grew up with gay marriage being a popularized concept so I've always viewed it as uniquely a straight thing. Gay marriage was probably the first mention of gay I ever heard growing up, and my parents being the liberals they are, it was always a positive thing. 

As a gay male myself, I would absolutely want to get married in the future (even if it ended with a divorce). For me, I have always been fascinated by the concept of marriage and wanted it for myself, even before I ever even knew what ""gay"" or ""gay marriage"" was.
