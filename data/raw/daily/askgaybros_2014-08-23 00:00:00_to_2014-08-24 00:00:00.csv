Things are great when it's just the two of us or even when we're with a group of mutual friends.

I've noticed a big change when he's around his best friend. They're very close - see each other 4 times or more a week, have movies nights together, never run out of conversation plus they just light up around each other.

I know they've been through alot together, been through thick and thin together but is it normal to be this close if you're just friends?

His friend identifies as straight. I think he's bi or in the closet (I've seen him cancel dates with girls just to hang out with my boyfriend.) 
I get the feeling if he suddenly came out the closet, my boyfriend would drop me in an instant. It doesn't help that his friend is better looking than me.

Am I just being insecure?

I go to school and work at a restaurant part time. It's a great restaurant, we're proud of what we do and are frequently recognized by the James Beard Foundation. Most of us are around the same age - young and in college, just graduated, twenties or early 30s. I like working here, the people can be annoying at times but we have fun, I have a passion for good food, and I make a lot of cash. The income is great.
I am very muscular and of average height. At work the other night, a female coworker around the same age as myself went into an irrational rage because she mistakenly thought I was spreading rumors about her and brought me out back and hit me multiple times, dug her fingernails into my arm, and shoved me. She did this in front of two other employees who were out back during service. One of the employees ran inside to grab the manager on duty and then the fight broke up. ""Fight"" is poor word choice because it wasn't a fight. I did not fight back. I did not feel comfortable raising my hand to a girl or putting my hands on her to defend myself. The manager, who is a lesbian, missed the actual confrontation but talked to the girl that abused me. I would assume that she condemned her behavior. Then she talked to me privately and scolded me for ""gossiping"" even though I did not spread any rumors about this girl. The whole thing was somewhat physically painful. When I got home I saw the true damage - it was mainly to my arm but it is black and blue and purple with huge bruises all over. I'm actually a little shocked at how bruised it is. It's been a few days now, going on a week, and the bruises are still there and prominent. I live at home with my mother and I've been hiding from her because I'm afraid my mom will be pissed and very concerned. Also, I don't want to stress her out. I also don't want her to overreact and get involved in my work life because I'm a grown man (kinda).

I feel like I'm in the most awkward position.

* Before this incident I considered this girl a close work friend. Not someone I hung out with outside of work but a good friend at work. I like this girl, at least I did like her, and want to remain friends with her.

* I keep replaying this in my head and know that if the roles were reversed I would be fired and arrested on the spot.

* I keep feeling like there is a double-standard.

* I feel disgusting and embarrassed in public when I wear short sleeved shirts that expose the horrific bruises and going to the gym got me a few awkward stares.

So anyways that night of the altercation she texted me and we both apologized to each other. I did more apologizing to her saying I didn't want to lose her as a friend. All she said was I'm sorry I shoved you. She hasn't seen the bruises so I don't think she exactly knows the extent of her abuse. I have not spoke to her in person yet.
I've talked to my manager since and she told me she didn't write her up for hitting me and she didn't write me up for ""gossiping"". The owner does not know the incident occurred. My manager told me if she had wrote us both up we both would be fired. Only a handful of employees know what happened that night. My manager said if I wanted to press charges against her I can but that's on me.
Here's the thing, I am not comfortable pressing charges. It would ruin this girl's life and I would likely lose my job in the process. Moreover, if I were to retain my job while she loses her job I would have to deal with pissed off coworkers. Plus I don't have enough time and energy to deal with all of that legal drama right now. Also, I'm not going to sue my restaurant. I need this job at the moment and don't want to do anything that would jeopardize it.
I don't know what to do. I suppose I need to start looking for a better job, maybe something that can actually apply towards my career. I feel embarrassed, frustrated, and emotionally exhausted from everything that's happened. I feel like an abuse victim who is forced to just suffer in silence. Every time I look in the mirror and see the marks on my body I feel shameful of myself. There is nothing I can do or I will lose my job and the money is too good right now. I don't necessarily feel threatened for my safety at work but I feel unjustly treated. Fortunately, I do have a few allies at work who've remarked to me that they are aghast that she wasn't fired. Truthfully, I didn't want to get this girl fired. The work environment would be pretty hostile towards me if she was. But also, before this, she was a nice girl. A part of me feels like maybe I'm too caught up in trying to make friends at work and this is all clouding my judgment. I don't know. All I know is that I feel violated and there doesn't seem to be a feasible solution to this mess. I haven't felt violated in a long time.

I had actually been planning to move to that same state with college friends for some time anyway. Alright Im rambling....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have plenty of friends in the area, but my bf lives alone and all of his friends are still in his home town over 2 hours drive away. How can I help him make more local friends?&lt;/p&gt;

I jerk off to straight porn A LOT but sometimes it feels like i am trying to prove to myself that I am straight? 
Every now and then I watch some gay porn and seem to get a lot more erect than normal, but this can also happen when watching str8porn as well.. or lesbian porn 


in either case, I've been told that porn should not be a deciding factor...

I am also from a very conservative country that is very anti-gay.

However, I still feel attracted to women, especially older women but
I don't go out of my way to meet any because I feel like what happened with the others will happen again. 
As a result ive become somewhat of a recluse, lost a serious amount of weight, smoke a lot of weed etc etc

I often see young people saying, ""I'm 22 why should I start saving for retirement.  I am posting this here because I would rather speak to my family than strangers.

The greatest asset you have as an investor is TIME.  While it may seem like a loooong way off to retirement, most of you have jobs that offer 401k's with lots of investment options.  If not and you are working you have the option of starting your own regular or ROTH IRA.

If retiring seems like too far off to think about it, change your thinking.  Instead look at IRA's and 401k's as a tax efficient way to build wealth instead of saving for retirement.  

I didn't start dabbling with investments until I was in my late 30's and didn't get serious until I was 40.  So I wasted 15 years, 15 very crucial years.  When I was young I wanted to buy clothes, drink, smoke pot, get the newest electronics because we want the bright shiny things when we are young.

But TIME is the investor's greatest asset.  If at age 32 you start putting away $100 a month and manage to earn 10% in 30 years that $36,000 investment turns into $226,048.  A very nice sum indeed.  BUT if you started at age 22 instead, which means you added another $12,000 to the mix you end up with $632,407.  Quite a huge difference for just an extra $12K.  But it isn't the $12k that made the big difference it is the 10 extra years of compounding that added the extra $400,000 to your wealth.  

401k's and IRA's were a mistake.  Yet they turned out to be the biggest tax benefit ever given to the working person.  Take advantage of the benefit when you are young.  

Every time I changed jobs I rolled my 401k into my self-directed IRA.  On 9/5/12 I lost my job of 20 years.  On the train going home I was in shock.  By the time I got home I had a smile on my face.  I had 2 years of expenses in cash, a healthy portfolio and unemployment coming my way.  So I didn't have to panic, I had options, I had time to think about what to do next.  I can't stress enough the need to have an emergency fund, it gives you options. 

I knew nothing about investing when I started and made plenty of mistakes along the way but I kept reading, reading and listening to the Nightly Business Report and a host of other financial talking heads shows.  The finance industry spends billions to convince us we aren't smart enough to invest our own money.  Don' t buy the hype, teach yourself and take control of your own future.

I'm madly in love with a guy I've been seeing for several months, confessed this to him, got ""well that's nice"" and some awkward silences since. Combine that with feelings of jealousy that come up seemingly from no where and all around anxiety about ""us"" as a couple, and I'm kind of driving myself bonkers in my own head.

A few points:

1. I'm perfectly ok with him not being ready to say the big L word, my anxiety is more ""what if he never is ready.""  

2. I trust him more than I've trusted anyone in a very long time (the last man I loved broke me with lies and infidelity 5 years ago and I only in the past 6 months even considered dating again), so the jealousy isn't a real fear of him cheating.  We're both flirts, we both talk about who we flirt with (and often in front of each other).  When it happens at the bar and we're both there, we have an amazing night when we get home -- the added tension just makes things great.  But sometimes, I feel hurt that he's flirting with other guys. It's completely fucked up and backward to think like this -- when I'm rational it doesn't bother me one bit, but sometimes it just enrages me.

3. Work, for both of us, has sucked recently.  We're both at points where we want a change in our careers and I feel a little apprehension on both of our parts. This just adds stress.

Basically, I'm stressed (sometimes about trivial shit that doesn't deserve the stress).  My normal stress reliever (working out) hasn't been helping nearly as much (mainly because my lifting combined with recent weight loss has driven my sex drive into overdrive (near constant blue balls while jacking off like a teenager), and the idea of spending more time in the gym, possibly making it worse, isn't my idea of fun). 

I would love any tips you guys have for destressing.  If you have advice on any points, that's great too, but most of them to me feel like ""shit happens, let's focus on being happy while we get through it"" rather than things I can change.
