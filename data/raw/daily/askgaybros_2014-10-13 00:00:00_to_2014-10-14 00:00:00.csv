TL;DR of original post: I am a 23-year-old closeted bi male who recently fell in love with his straight best bro, Chris, who shows unusual affection such as spooning/cuddling, constant hugs, incessant compliments, and even neck kisses. What do I do?

[Update Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/2hsvrl/update_i_think_i_am_in_love_with_my_best_bro/)

TL;DR of update post: Some stuff happened and now I'm not so sure I was special to him to begin with.

NEW STUFF

Not even sure where to start, so much has happened since the last post. Well, I'll just start with the end result and then move on to how it came about. Long story short, I spent this entire past weekend at Chris's house with the plan of coming out to him and telling him how I felt. It was the hardest thing I've ever done, but I followed through with it. He confirmed that he was 100% straight, but he was very welcoming and we're now closer than ever as friends.

Okay, so since the last update, my feelings for him had been getting stronger and stronger every day. I even had a couple of panic attacks and broke down into tears several times. I've never had emotional reactions like that to anything or felt like that about anyone. It was a completely new experience for me.

One major thing that happened a couple of weeks ago was that I was cuddling with him as usual, and gave into my urges. I did things like kiss his neck, grind my erection into his back, and held his hand. I don't know how much of that he was awake for, but for me, it was a beautiful night. I now feel really bad about that and wish I hadn't done it, but it felt right at the time.

However, the next time we were to share a bed, he requested that we stick to our halves of the bed. He said that he had trouble sleeping when we cuddled because of some insomnia/sleep apnea issues, and he really needed to be able to stretch out. The timing of all this coming out (especially considering we had probably spooned ten or so times at that point) made me think that he had been awake for the previous session and wanted to keep it from happening again. This was understandable, but I still felt kind of crushed. We slept in the same bed several times after this, but never cuddled. That was hard.

Nevertheless, I was still determined to tell him everything. I finally did so yesterday morning, on my birthday (I'm 24 now). And although it may have been the hardest thing I've ever done (whole body shaking, trying to fight tears, heart in my throat...), I did it. I told him everything. That he was the only person I trusted with this info, that I was bisexual, how I came to figure that out about myself, what he meant to me and how I felt about him... I called him out for his unusual acts of affection, but told him that even if he didn't reciprocate, he was still my best friend and I didn't want anything to get in the way of that. I told him I understood if this changed things for him or if we couldn't be friends anymore, and told him I would leave his house right then if that's what he wanted.

He reacted more positively than I really could have imagined. He said that although he was 100% straight and couldn't reciprocate my feelings (which I pretty much knew was a pipe dream in the first place), everything was all good between us. He said he already had strong suspicions that I wasn't completely straight He said  it didn't change anything. He said that he could get very physical and bro-like when it came to his good friends and he apologized for sending off any misinterpreted signals. He even apologized for any gay slurs him and the other guys sometimes used, and that he hated that he still slips into using them sometimes. He said I was a great guy and anyone who ended up in a relationship with was a very lucky girl/guy.

Later that night, he brought it up again and wanted to know if he was the only one who knew. I told him he was the ONLY person that knew. I guess he was humbled by that because he hugged me when I confirmed that. He said that it was awesome I now had a person I could talk to about anything. He said I could even discuss gay sex with him if I wanted lol.

We also discussed labels and how utterly useless they are. He said it shouldn't matter that I'm bi or who I'm attracted to because I'm still the same person regardless.

I also told him my fears that because I had admitted being attracted to him, that he would feel uncomfortable or feel like he had to tiptoe around me. He said that he didn't see it that way at all, and that he was actually flattered. He said that because I had trusted him so much to tell him, he felt like he could now trust me with absolutely anything too.

When we went to bed, I just told him ""Thanks Chris... For everything."" He was just like, ""Yeah buddy"", gave me one llast hug, and kissed me on the neck.

Overall, I'm really happy with the way things turned out. No, he didn't reciprocate how I felt, but we are now closer friends than ever. I feel like my first coming out experience could not have gone any better.

I really want to thank everyone here who encouraged me to go through with it. Yes it was really hard but totally worth it. r/askgaybros is full of some really great people and I'll be thankful for life

I'd like to thank one user in particular who reached out to me via private message and helped me through the whole thing; I wouldn't have made it without him. You know who you are dude and you're a friend for life.

TL;DR: I came out to him. He didn't reciprocate my feelings, but we are now closer friends than ever.

I'm pretty ecstatic this morning over how everything turned out. Thanks again, r/gaybros, you pretty much changed my life.

I (20) came out to some people in May and figured I could start dating. I found this guy online and we chatted for two weeks and decided to meet up. Well, he stood me up the day before my birthday and never texted again. It was whatever, but it only stung because this was me taking a nice step forward just to be shutdown the day before my birthday.

Moving on!

In early September, I made the jump to Grindr **strictly** for dating. After two days a guy a few years older than me came along. We talked with some good conversations. Eventually, I got his number and we texted very often. I warmed up to him and decided to meet. It went great and we went out again. So for the next three weeks I was trying to get a nighttime date -- a more romantic one. First, he had other dinner plans. The second time he said maybe and then I'm pretty sure he lied and was with friends when he was supposed to work early. 

Then the third time was last week. It was all lining up perfectly. But about forty minutes before he was going to pick me up, he canceled feeling sick. I was bummed because I was so excited. So I gave space and sent him a get well text that night. I didn't get anything until the following night when I sent another text checking in to see if he was alright. He immediately got back to me. So I attempted conversation once Saturday and once Sunday.

He's clearly no longer interested, and I told him to just come out and say that if so. And this morning on Twitter I found out yesterday he went out to dinner. Now I'm not going to make a firm claim, but it could be a boyfriend -________-. This was something I noticed pretty early on (that this guy seemed a little close). But I don't know that for sure at all.

It's just disappointing because I thought there was really something this time. What the hell, he's older so he *should* be more mature! Any words of encouragement or advice is welcome!

I'm in college at a liberal university in New England and have gotten to know one of my teammates pretty well. I'm getting the vibe that he's gay and possibly into me, but I can't really be sure. 
I've noticed the following:
-he talks in a softer voice when he's talking 1 on 1 with me
-commonly talks about sexual things around me (but no one else)
-he glances at me and looks away when I notice
-he looks at me the most when talking with a group of people
-never hooks up with girls/hasn't had a gf...only talks girls stereotypically(blondes, boobs, etc. Rarely.)

He doesn't know that I'm gay, but I'm planning on telling him soon. We've spent a lot of time together and I can't tell if he's flirting back or has just become comfortable with me as a friend.

What can I do to see if he's interested? Coming out to him will be a start.
Thanks!

I want to do it, I want to make him squirm, squeal and moan, but I get scared that I'll hurt him or go too far or something.  

How do I reconcile within myself that I won't hurt him, that I can do this and that I won't go too far?

I have some kind of annoying issue.

So, I've almost always been unlucky in the guys department. I've found tons of guys attractive in my life, from all type: chubby, tall, muscular, hairy, average, etc. So I always assumed I wasn't picky physically.

Personality-wise though, I'm less open, thanks to some wounds past-relationships gave me. But I still try.

Unfortunately, except maybe once (ex lulz), I haven't found a single guy who had both a good personality AND an attractive physic all at once. If I go for the physic, most of the time the guy's an empty vessel or a douche... and if I went on the personality side, there weren't any physical attraction, or the guy was too effeminate, or too insecure, or I don't know.

**The issue**: A guy I didn't notice at a party I went to added me on FB last week. We've talked each day (him coming to me each time) AND we had a date yesterday. The guy has an amazing personality, we have tons of things in common, we talked for hours. He was an interesting discovery. **BUT** I haven't felt the need to get touchy at all, not even kiss him. There was nothing, not even a spark... Well, there was a ""this guy has an attractive personality"" feel, but nothing else. On the other side, I know I pleased him, a lot. He even wants to cook me dinner while I study for my exam just to see me.

And it breaks my heart because... I feel nothing for now and he has an amazing personality. I don't know if it's an unconscious self-defense mechanism, if I'm being picky, if I'm just retarded, or if there is just nothing... And I fear I might miss a good opportunity for something as dumb as that. He's not ugly, but... I don't know.

To start off, I will admit that I am probably more on the conservative end when it comes to opinions on sex. I rarely talk about my sex life while in a group, PDA is something that I have almost zero experience with, and I just sort of think that sex and sex acts should be between the two (or more) people having sex. 

For example, I was at the club with my main group of friends last week, and one of the gogo boys came up to sell us shots. My friend bought a round and then offered a big tip to touch his dick. Which then turned into touching his bare dick (as opposed to through the speedo) and he eventually started trying to get the guy hard before the gogo guy left. My friends thought it was the most hilarious thing ever, I thought it was pretty sad and extremely off-putting, similarly, during pride we saw a guy sucking a dancer off in the middle of the dance floor. Again, friends thought it was amazing, I looked away.

There's been other things as well, the biggest thing was when I first stayed over at a friend's place with a group after a night out of heavy drinking, I woke up in the middle of the night with one of the guys' hands down my pants trying to get me hard. When I told my friend about it a few days later, the long and short of it was that that's a funny thing that the guy has done before. This is also a guy that has no problem cross dressing and posting on Craigslist looking to trick straight guys. 

There's so much more, from how I see them (and other groups) act at the clubs, to constantly getting groped by men and then getting told it's no big deal, to just how constantly every conversation we have as a group somehow transitions to sex or cock or blowing somebody.

When I was a freshman in college; I started to become a little more comfortable with myself and started to accept myself for being gay. I went on spring break in Panama City Beach, FL and met a guy that lived about an hour and a half from me back home in Oklahoma. We chatted and met up a few times that week and once spring break was over we continued to talk for about 3 months on a daily basis. While at school we were about 3 hours away and could never manage to see each other. So as summer approached we started making plans to see each other. I'm not sure when it happened but this overwhelming feeling of discomfort started growing. I started having doubts that I was gay and a bit of internalized homophobia began. I was young, stupid, and not comfortable in my own skin. So I ended up ending things with him after a major freak out on my own part.

Since then, I've thought about him a lot and part of me thinks this is ridiculous because it was just a small fling during spring break. At the same time, this is the first guy that I ever became comfortable with and I felt like I actually connected with him in a way during that 3 months of talking to each other. So 3 years later he texts me (this was three days ago) out of the blue and says that he's going on a road trip and will be coming through my town on the way to his mini vacation with his best friend. This throws me for a loop because it's been three years since we've talked to each other. He starts saying that he's coming back through my town in a couple days and leaves it at that. So I'm like let's have dinner, or coffee or whatever. That was today. He ends up telling me him and his friend are tired and are going home. I'm confused now. I'd still being willing to give things a second chance. I'm at a lot better place myself and could actually contribute to a relationship. He texts me out of the blue then turns down hanging out when he's driving through my town. I texted him on and off the last couple days and he seems to be short. I don't know what to think about this. If he would actually be down, I'd be willing to drive and see him. Does anyone have any insight on situations like this or any past experience.

He was drunk obviously but I've never heard him be so coherent and adamant about something at the same time. I'm fucking scared. I tried talking to him today about it but he's being really distant, doesn't want to give or receive any physical affection, and the look he gives me is painful.
