I've started keto and a light exercise routine consisting of c25k and body weights (can't really do anything heavier due to a form of muscular dystrophy that I have) and am now down 30lbs and feeling a little better mentally.  Physically I still have a long way to go to where I want to be but at least it's a start and im motivated to keep going.  Mentally things still aren't all that great, but they're a little better at least.  I should be seeing a psychiatrist this month.

Financially I've started working with a state rehabilitation program to get myself back into the workforce, but they're still strongly urging me to go on disability before entering the program.  The social worker actually scolded me for not accepting food stamps or help with housing, saying I was sabotaging myself.  I would rather be earning by my own 2 hands (plus working again would help keep me sane), but I'm also coming to the point where I'll just have to swallow my pride and do what's best for my own survival.

With that out the way I have a bit of a problem that's been bugging me for a while.  I am not a handsome guy- at best I would describe myself looking closely like a [mountain gorilla](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3Dhxj0Y2mUk/Tx0wQLTtJxI/AAAAAAAAAQE/-P40P2SHH2Q/s1600/Mountain-Gorilla-1-AR.jpg).  Add to the fact that people always say I look angry all the time (i'm not, im just ugly.  I'm actually very timid) and despite my muscle illness, I still have broad shoulders and a build from when I used to play football, I don't exactly give off the most approachable vibe even when it comes to just making friends.  Making friends is very rare, and it's even rarer if a guy flirts with me.

I get my haircut once a month at the same barbershop.  The last 2 times there's been a new guy who's cut my hair.  First time off the bat he seemed eager to cut my hair and didn't let any of the other barbers offer.  He also seemed a bit more friendlier than the guys that normally cut hair there (they're all students) and was asking me a lot more personal life questions than I usually experience by most barbers.  I simply wrote it off as him just being a really nice guy and that my gaydar was broken or me just projecting because face it, i'm sad and lonely.

The second time I went back I ended up getting the same guy.  He recognized me from before and acted the same way as the last visit.  He asked me what I was doing this weekend, and I said ""nothing planned"", and asked him the same question to make conversation, and he said ""nothing planned yet"".  Haircut began, all seemed to be going down as normal, except I started to notice he was being a bit more touchy-feely than you needed to be when cutting someones hair.  Again I wrote it off as just being an over active imagination... except it continued.  I decided to test it a bit and put my hand visibly on the arm-rest.  Instead of turning the chair from the back, he started turning it from where my hand was, making hand contact each time.  I convinced myself it was just mere coincidence.  Things continued and more tiny little signs popped up, but I kept convincing myself that my imagination needed to be reigned in or that I was over thinking things.  The haircut was almost done with so I could go home and forget about it.  That is until he put his crotch right on my hand.  I made no attempts to move my hand (other than wiggle my fingers slightly), and it pretty much stayed there for nearly 30 seconds.

I had my answer, as unlikely as it seemed he was flirting with me.  He finished up, and as I was getting up he offered to trim my beard- I declined because I usually do it myself, and I thanked him and went up front to pay.  As I was paying he came up again and asked me if I was doing anything for the weekend.  I said ""nothing really other than a few errands"", and he said in reply: ""I don't have any plans either so....""  I completely froze up, and there was a bit of awkward silence for a few seconds.  I thanked him again and nervously left quickly.

I'm still trying to convince myself it was nothing, and that I'm just imagining things, because it's the easier thing to think and mainly because my life is filled with so many problems at the moment and I don't feel like I should be asking anyone out on a date.  Especially since it's not like I have a anything to offer with things being as they are.  I feel too much shame about where I am in life, and even more so too embarrassed to reveal those things to someone in real life.  I'm a total train wreck right now, and the fear and embarrassment of someone suddenly (and rightfully so to be honest) rejecting me after finding out that fact gives me a lot of dread.   I'm working hard to improve things, but it just doesn't feel like I deserve to even think about dating until things improve.  On the other hand it's extremely rare when someone makes such an obvious overture at me, and I'm not sure if I should just get my balls up, take a chance, put myself out there, ask him out and let him judge.

**TL,DR:**  Life is shitty, but working on it.  My Barber is flirting hard with me &amp; trying to get me to ask him out, too ashamed about my life to date, not sure if I should just do it or ignore his advances and keep to myself until I'm not such a train wreck.  Wat do.

Lately I have been attending several chillouts/after parties where sex has been a casual occurrence, usually in combination with drugs and alcohol. What I have noticed is that gay men have a particularly fluid view of sex between friends, particularly older gays. 

Is this an exception or the rule? That as gay men, we increasingly become more willing to blur the line between fuck buddy and friend. Is this the gay lifestyle I should get used to, where hosting a Sunday sex orgy is  the gay equivalent of a day at the park?

It would be nice to hear your thoughts on this issue, because to me it does not seem to be a healthy sustainable lifestyle.

I love my boyfriend of 1.5 years. We're having a sexual issue that's been an issue for us in the past.

I've had to resort to pleasuring some of my interests on my own - fleshjack, dildo, etc. Since he doesn't top or bottom, I have tried to get him to use these toys on me, with no success - he's not interested in toys either. 

I've discussed the issue and we've tried integrating these toys into our bedroom but it hasn't taken off. He's not into using them on me -we've tried it and he is disinterested and turned off by it. I don't want to be a dick by suggesting that he let me fuck other guys sometimes because he doesn't want to do the sexual things I'm interested in, but at the same time, I'm already doing these things with pieces of plastic, plenty of the time when he's not around.

don't want to shame him for not having sexual tastes that not everyone has, but I'm concerned and worried about us not being a sexual match. I don't want us to break up if I could just release the steam with someone else sometimes.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve discussed the issue and we&amp;#39;ve tried integrating these toys into our bedroom but it hasn&amp;#39;t taken off. He&amp;#39;s not into using them on me -we&amp;#39;ve tried it and he is disinterested and turned off by it. I don&amp;#39;t want to be a dick by suggesting that he let me fuck other guys sometimes because he doesn&amp;#39;t want to do the sexual things I&amp;#39;m interested in, but at the same time, I&amp;#39;m already doing these things with pieces of plastic, plenty of the time when he&amp;#39;s not around. He knows it goes on. I 
don&amp;#39;t want to shame him for not having sexual tastes that not everyone has, but I&amp;#39;m concerned and worried about us not being a sexual match. I don&amp;#39;t want us to break up if I could just release the steam with someone else sometimes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have any of you had a similar situation? How do you approach the conversation? Has it worked for any of you? &lt;/p&gt;

I live in the midwest in the suburbs. I still plan on continuing my college education. I've already googled for nearby shelters and such...just any advice on living a homeless lifestyle would be nice :)

Update:  
Your comments have all been really helpful and frankly, they've really increased my resolve haha  
My plan is to live out of my car and shower/hygiene at the university's gym. I only have one year left until I finish my nursing degree. I can hold out until then and get my finances in place, hopefully I can get an apartment then!
You guys have been so helpful and awesome and nice! I really needed the kick in the pants to focus on solving my problems rather than complaining about them. Again, you're all seriously awesome!
