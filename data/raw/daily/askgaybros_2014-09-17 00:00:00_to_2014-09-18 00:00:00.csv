A long while back I had this huge crush on a guy that worked at target who never noticed me.  After almost a full year we somehow ended up talking via grindr a while after he broke up with his boyfriend.  It took a few months for that to go anywhere but once I moved into my new apartment I would see him more and more.  We started talking seriously for about a month.  Things were awesome! then we decided to consider each other boyfriends one night.  Also that night, even though he was drunk, this guy confessed to me that he thought he might be falling in love with me.  Although sadly four days later he ended it because he leaves for boot camp in January and claimed that it hurt him too much to be with me knowing he'd lose me in three and a half months.  So we had the usual textbook, sappy type breakups with me watching him as he went inside his apartment trying to think of something to say to get him to stay, him turning around to look back at me an me turning away to hide my tearing up face.  
          Now, one of my roommates is gay as well.  He and I would spend a lot of time talking about guys and were started to get pretty close.  He is also going into the national guard.  One night while drinking during the time me and my guy were still together, I walked outside to the patio where my bf and roommate were smoking together and talking.  When I opened the door, I see my boyfriend sitting on top of my roommate.  It made me mad but I dismissed it as drunk behavior.After the breakup I would lay on the couch and mope about how I've been waiting for this guy and now I lost him even though (I believed at the time) he cared about me.  Once night after work my roommate told me to wait up for him because there was something wrong he needed to tell me about.  When he arrived he ended up revealing to me a bunch of stuff.  Apparently him and my ex had been talking a long time ago but nothing ever came of it.  And when I introduced my man to my roommate they recognized each other but pretended like they had never met, which they kept up whenever I was around.  Then my roommate told me about how they had both gone to the recruiter the day before but it was closed so they just spent the day together.  they talked in the car for a few hours and then went to dinner, then going back to the apartment and talking more, then kissing.  this is about two days after we had broken up.  The second my roommate told me about the kiss I stormed upstairs, punching the wall.  This was the second time a guy had left me then gotten over me in a matter of days even though he said he cared about me.  So I leave the house at 5:30 in the morning having a mental breakdown.  I drove  all over the town trying to think about what I just heard.  My roommate was upset and tried to call me to tell me to come back home and that he was worried about me.  I didnt know what to say because I couldnt even think I was so angry.  My roommate knew better than anyone how I felt about this guy and yet he told me he thought the day they spent was a date.  So my roommate, who was supposed to be   leaving for WV in a few hours to go on a big trip he'd been waiting for for a long time, told me he needed to go to see his mom and talk about things and that he wouldnt be going to WV.  For some reason I convinced him to go on his trip anyway, mostly because I didnt want him home at the apartment that weekend anymore.  The next day I called him and told him i didnt want to be angry at him and that I thought after some time I would come to forgive him since he was honest about it.  But the next few days, my roommate was kind of a jerk to me about the typical roommate quarrels involving dishes and what not.  Despite this, I still tried to be nice to him and even set up a deal for him to get a queen sized mattress for his bed so he wouldnt have to sleep on an air mattress. I even got a truck to bring it to the apartment and even took an evening off to help him move it.  And yet the next day I asked him to load some dishes in the dishwasher for me while I was at work and he went off saying that he cleaned his own dishes and that he wasnt responsible for my shit.  Now just to be clear, I am the one who organizes everything in my apartment.  I st up the entire apartment deal, I organized the move in date.  I set up all the utilities on my own, I clean the dishes 80% of the time, and Im the only person to ever take out trash here.  So I didnt think it would be a big deal to ask him to do one load since I do a lot for him anyway.  But he goes on Facebook and posts for people to comment about if he should have to clean other peoples shit when he doesnt have any dirty dishes.  So I talked to him and thought we had come to a good, not yelling conclusion to the situation.  He even said he would take out trash sometimes too.  Later that night I asked him if he would please take down his status which I felt was a passive aggressive way to tell me I'm wrong.  He acted like he had no idea what I was talking about and asked why it bothered me.  At this point I kind of lost it and said that I didnt feel like he even cared about me trying to be nice to him despite the fact that what he did really hurt me. I told him how I felt that being nice and helping him with his mattress and everything wasnt exactly easy and that it was bothering me that hes been kind of a jerk to me lately.  To which he replied ""could you be a little less dramatic?"".  I said that I was just asking him nicely and politely to take down his status and be a little more sensitive to how I was feeling.  I honestly am not a nasty person and didnt say anything rude or anything id regret but my roommates responce really pisses me off.  The gist of it was that he didn't think he did anything wrong involving my ex.  He went on to say the status was ""to make sure he was right about the dishes"" then said that I wasnt going to guilt him into feeling sorry for me and that I should stop bitching at him.  
      This whole thing has me incredibly angry.  Am I being irrational? sure the guy and I werent married or anything but the roommate still knew how I felt about him and tried jumping on that train barely 24 hours after I lost him.  The roommate had even said, that night when I found out, that he was wrong to go on a date and that he violated my trust.  I guess his mother talked him out of feeling any kind of guilt or remorse.  So how should I feel? How do i confront my roommate? how do I even live with him?  keep in mind the roommate is one of those gays where there is no disagreeing with who is generally kind of nasty.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alright so this is about to be a long one, and I need some opinions of whether I&amp;#39;m overreacting or not.

Hey gay bros.  Straight bro here wanting some advice.  I have this friend I've known for about 5 years now.  We met on a part time study course and have kept in touch ever since.  We live quite far apart but I see him every couple months when I have work in his town and he lets me stay over.  I've known he was gay since we first met and that's never been an issue.  I really enjoy hanging out with him but I'm starting to worry that he may have feelings for me.  I don't know if his behaviour is weird or not.

I always have an awesome time when I get to visit him.  We chat like no time has passed, play xbox, have a drink and a smoke, he cooks me amazing food.  He's a great host.  But he has this thing about nudity. Like, it feels like he keeps finding way to get naked or almost naked with me and wants me to do the same with him.

So last time I was in town, we met up at a pub that was near both where I had my last meeting and his gym.  After drinking and catching up we head back to his where he says he needs to jump in the shower.  I make myself comfortable in the lounge and when he comes out he's just wearing a towel.  That's OK with me because it's his house and he's comfortable and all that, but it's a really small towel and he stayed in it for the rest of the night.  It 'slipped' a few times and he'd make apologies and put it back on but he never went and got dressed.  And there were times when he sat in some positions on the sofa that he was basically showing me his junk so I'd tell him and he'd readjust, but he kept seeming to forget.  

Other times he's come out of his room in the morning to where I'm sleeping on his sofa and he's been bollock naked saying he'd forgot I was there.  The first times it happened he'd go off and put on some pants (but like really figure hugging tight ones) but then more recently he'd just shrug and cup his dick and go around like that for a bit making tea and toast.  Once he said he said he was really sore from his workout and needed to soak in the bath and got me to join him in the bathroom so we could keep on talking.  I play rugby so I have no problem with seeing guys naked in the changing room and sharing showers and so on so it seemed OK.  It was a different because it was just the 2 of us but it felt like a kind of bonding thing.

And there's loads of other examples.  So I don't know if this is a normal thing for gay guys to be so comfortable or if this is him trying to impress me or something.  I can see he has a good body and he puts a lot of work into it but I'm just not wired that way to be into him.  There's never been anywhere like this level of nakedness when I'm hanging out with my straight mates - There are times over this summer where it's been really hot and we've just hung out in our boxers but I've no problem with that, but I haven't done it with this guy because I don't know if I'd give him the wrong signals.

He spilled wine on me once (yeah classic porno start!) and got me to let him wash my clothes.  I had my gym kit with me though so changed into that.  I think he was a bit disappointed because he said he wanted to wash that too and would lend me some pants while my clothes were waahing.  He was already only in his pants by then - can't remember how he'd found an excuse to strip off that time - so I just told him I was fine in the gym kit.

Also he often offers to share his bed with me instead of me sleeping on the sofa.  He doesn't make a big deal about it but I get the feeling he;d really like me to.  I don't know.  I share with other mates plenty of times but I know this guy sleeps naked and is gay so it would be weird I think.

So here are my questions.  Are you guys so free with your bodies in front of your mates?  Does it make a difference if they're gay or straight?  Do you offer to share beds with your mates that you don't fancy?

I'm staying with him again this weekend.  Meeting up on Wednesday evening and staying until Sunday.  Like I say, I really him as a mate and also I need his hospitality.  Just not sure what's going on really. 

---

Update:  Thanks for all the comments guys.  So basically the consensus seems to be that he has feelings for me.  He's gone to bed now (and kept his clothes on all night!)  He cooked an amazing meal for us and we just talked and caught up.  I didn't bring any of this up because I just don't know how to approach it.  I realised tonight that I really enjoy spending time with him and really care about him.  I don't want to crush him.  He's going through a rough patch at the moment and seems really low.  Honestly I've sat here for about an hour now reading through all these comments and wondering if I should just slip into his bed and hold him but I see that would just make things worse.  Anyway. Tiring day and another tomorrow so I need to hit the sack now and try to get some sleep.

There&amp;#39;s never been anywhere like this level of nakedness when I&amp;#39;m hanging out with my straight mates - There are times over this summer where it&amp;#39;s been really hot and we&amp;#39;ve just hung out in our boxers but I&amp;#39;ve no problem with that, but I haven&amp;#39;t done it with this guy because I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;d give him the wrong signals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He spilled wine on me once (yeah classic porno start!) and got me to let him wash my clothes.  I had my gym kit with me though so changed into that.  I think he was a bit disappointed because he said he wanted to wash that too and would lend me some pants while my clothes were waahing.  He was already only in his pants by then - can&amp;#39;t remember how he&amp;#39;d found an excuse to strip off that time - so I just told him I was fine in the gym kit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also he often offers to share his bed with me instead of me sleeping on the sofa.  He doesn&amp;#39;t make a big deal about it but I get the feeling he;d really like me to.  I don&amp;#39;t know.  I share with other mates plenty of times but I know this guy sleeps naked and is gay so it would be weird I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here are my questions.  Are you guys so free with your bodies in front of your mates?  Does it make a difference if they&amp;#39;re gay or straight?  Do you offer to share beds with your mates that you don&amp;#39;t fancy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m staying with him again this weekend.  Meeting up on Wednesday evening and staying until Sunday.  Like I say, I really him as a mate and also I need his hospitality.  Just not sure what&amp;#39;s going on really. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update:  Thanks for all the comments guys.  So basically the consensus seems to be that he has feelings for me.  He&amp;#39;s gone to bed now (and kept his clothes on all night!)  He cooked an amazing meal for us and we just talked and caught up.  I didn&amp;#39;t bring any of this up because I just don&amp;#39;t know how to approach it.  I realised tonight that I really enjoy spending time with him and really care about him.  I don&amp;#39;t want to crush him.  He&amp;#39;s going through a rough patch at the moment and seems really low.  Honestly I&amp;#39;ve sat here for about an hour now reading through all these comments and wondering if I should just slip into his bed and hold him but I see that would just make things worse.  Anyway. Tiring day and another tomorrow so I need to hit the sack now and try to get some sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

He was from a small town so I understand there's a lot of pressure for him to be straight, from his parents, to his friends, to even the small town that he lives in. The more we hung out, the more we realized we had a lot in common. We completely understood each other, we were on the same page for everything, and we quickly became best friends, we even said we were each other's puzzle pieces. Soon we began to take things further, even though he told me a few times that he wasn't sure about himself and that he doesn't know what would happen in the future, he would flip from bi to gay and back to bi, EDIT: I am the first guy he explored his sexuality with, before that he was straight. But I didn't listen, I thought I knew better because everything felt right on my end. The long conversations every night, the phone sex we had was amazing, I could get him off just by talking to him, even the physical stuff we did, he said was mind blowing compared to his previous relationships and that he never knew it could feel that way.

But, just recently, he told me he realized he was straight and that he doesn't think he could be sexually attracted to any guy, which caught me off guard since everything was going so well. We had a long talk and he told me he doesn't want to lose me as a friend. We've opened up so much to each other, and I know so much about him, he doesn't want to lose our friendship. He said I meant so much to him. 

I'm still falling for him, and to regress back to just best friends would hurt me so much, knowing that we both enjoyed the sexual aspect of the relationship. It also hurts because all the sweet things he says to me now, won't carry the same meaning. And I don't know how to handle him finding some other girl. I just feel defeated. 

I don't want to give up this friendship, he is the one person I've truly connected with. and we've had so many deep conversations and we've connected on so many levels.

How do I maintain this friendship?

What did I do wrong?

What am I supposed to do?

Here's my dilemma: I don't really know HOW to flirt/approach people in a situation where subtlety and modesty are called for (like basically ANYWHERE that isn't Grindr or a gay bar, which aren't options for me given my location).

Add in the fact that I only see them while they're working/ on their way into work, and it makes it even harder to determine how to talk to them.

Like, I wanna just walk in and say ""Hi!"" and shoot the breeze with them, but I'm not that bold.

This is a bit of a gross issue, but I have a problem where I am unable to cleanly bottom.
 
I'm a 22-year-old vers bi guy and I had a thing with an older guy for a while. First few times everything went fine, I used a Fleet (twice) before each hookup and everything was clean. Then it quit working as well, and spots and other unappealing messes started showing up. The last time we hooked up (also the last time I saw him) I ate a light lunch, skipped dinner and Fleeted three times (once in the shower). He made a comment about how he ""tore that ass up"" when he looked down during sex... I figured out what he meant afterwards when I went to clean myself. It was a mess and I was horrified.

Am I missing something? As a vers guy I would really like to be able to bottom when I want to. I was following [these instructions](http://anexperimentintruth.blogspot.com/2012/01/bottoming-101.html?m=1), which seem pretty legit and worked originally. I don't know what happened, and I don't want to have to do deep cleanses every time I bottom and shove shower hoses up my ass. Any help would be appreciated.

**TLDR:** *Things have gotten a LOT better.*


I talked to my SO about his drinking a little while back. We had a discussion on how I felt about it, how I worried about him, and how I wanted him to cut back.

So far, he has done a great job.

He has progressed from drinking a 6-pack a night for every two or three nights a week, to having one beer (if even that) a night. 

It is still a bit more than I would like, (and he knows), however I understand why. He has started his second job, and has been working doubles every single day for the last two weeks. While unhealthy, he is drinking because of the stress.

Yet, even with extra stress, he has kept his drinking down A LOT more than he would have previously. And before picking up the second job (but after we had talked), he was down to drinking only one every three or four nights.

It's just awesome. I am happy to see him make an attempt to change for me. We are as close as ever. He was very receptive and understanding. He was really concerned for how I felt and how I was worried about him, and responded to it.

Best of luck to anyone else in a similar situation. Always communicate, as things can't get better until you do. I'd be happy to talk to anyone who is in the same boat.

I am currently 20 years old and I have a giant crush on my 19 year old friend. We see eachother for at least another half a year each single day. We sit across eachother and we became quite the buds. He brought me home after knowing eachother for a few days and we recently spend the weekend together. 

I find him to be very attractive and he is so genuine and really kind. I am not sure if he is attracted to men. There are some signs but I am not entirely sure.

Here is the thing, I recently invited my other friend over to join the internship. He needed one so I offered him to come. I knew that it would be troublesome on my end. I knew that I would get jealous because they live like 30 seconds from eachother and I live 30 minutes from them. They get to travel together and I dont. 

I am so afraid that they will become close and I would become third wheel. I dont want to be alone. And I want to hold him/love him. 
And there is nothing I can do about it. It hurts me so much. Feeling this way causes me to do everything to prevent them spending time together. 
I do it like it comes natural to me and it makes me feel like a fucking asshole. I am so scared of going into a depression again. 

I'm sorry this is something lots of you go through but I can't change the way I feel. I know it's wrong but still.

And sometimes we have this eye contact that feels so different than other times I have eye contact with people. We look at eachother so frequently but we don't smile or anything. It has this sexy vibe haha I don't know.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi there, &lt;/p&gt;

Basically, loud ass co worker asks me to date someone at work and I turned her offer down by saying ""She's not what I'm interested in"" and ""I see her as a friend"" to which she replied ""oh I didn't know you were like that. You don't want to date her because she's fat, I didn't know you were that kind of person..."" She puts things WAY out of context and I know I would regret telling her I was gay but I didn't want rumors surfacing everywhere about what I did or did not say so I told her (the truth) I was gay. Case closed but unfortunately her mouth was not. 

Little by little the same thing that happened at my previous jobs began happening again. I was being treated different. Luckily people at work are really nice and I knew I wouldn't have any issues but I knew for a fact that she has told everyone. 

Flash forward to a co worker who never really talks to me at all. Turns out he's gay and what not. Where once he never spoke a word to me, now he wont stop talking to me and I get it. He feels we now have things in common but its not slipping out of my memory that he used to not talk to me. Not only that, he keeps commenting on my looks. Its a dead give away.I know he  wants to get to know me on some personal level. We have conversations every now and then and the one thing they have in common is the large generational gap between us. 

During one conversation he invites me over to his place to watch TV. This being the first real conversation, other than small talk, we've had since I started working there. His invitation escalates pretty quick. I let him know I have plans.  About two days later he brings the subject up again as if I agreed to to to his place on a certain date. I told him that (the truth) that I had plans to go to another co workers place that night after school. He quickly bombards this co-worker with ""Why didn't you invite me?!"" She was caught off guard. While I was leaving (the whole why didn't you invite me thing happen as I was leaving) I saw him go outside for a smoke looking pretty pissed.

Being in a work environment, I never asked for this so I know all I have to say is 'no' but it hasn't even gotten to that point but I know its going to get there. Any way I can diffuse the situation before it gets to that point?

On the other hand he could just be trying to make a new friend and I'm thinking way too much into this and just being a total asshole about it.

The last time I had approached some guys at this place it didn&amp;#39;t lead to anything so I thought, &amp;quot;fuck this, I&amp;#39;m just going to have a good time out with my friends.&amp;quot; Needless to say, drunk me was still wanting to get with a guy anyway. I couldn&amp;#39;t tell what I was doing wrong until I spotted this cute, muscled guy looking at me and I didn&amp;#39;t look away like I usually do. Almost immediately, the guy started walking towards me. Holy hell, I felt powerful right then. I&amp;#39;m a somewhat outgoing guy who&amp;#39;s still working on overcoming the shy guy he used to be so I guess eye contact is one of those last remnants of shyness I need to work on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So really, I gotta thank you guys for the tip! I wish I had taken this advice earlier!&lt;/p&gt;

You guys were very helpful, but he doesn't seem to be too into me. We talked and I asked him to meet up for a coffee, but he said he's busy (seemed indefinite).

**TL;DR** So that guy doesn't really seem like he wants to meet up, but I met a married guy at a bar on Friday who wants to suck me off. Nobody ever hits on me and I really want to say yes. Will I regret saying yes? 

I went out with my friends and everyone was coupled so I roamed on my own at the bar (straight bar). Started talking to this girl I knew (acquaintance) and this guy joins in. He seemed really cool, kind of older, but it was fine cause it's a bar and who cares. He was out with a group of his friends, one of them was leaving the city and anyways, I kept getting vibes. My friend left with her girlfriends and me and this guy were just making fun of people who were together and at the end of the night when I was leaving he asked me for my number. Things are really looking up for me, right?! The guy was cute and really chill!

So we talk over the weekend, We surpassed friendly and eventually we were sending each other pics. He starts talking about meeting up and telling me what he wants to do to me, but then he asks me if I can keep everything quiet because he's married. .... .... .... ....I like him for his honesty?

WHY.  WHYYYY
WTF.
WHY.

Anyways, the worst part is- moral dilemma. I haven't gotten anything for a year now. I know it's really bad, but I'm very heavily considering it. Would you guys do it? I'm so horny. I know it's REALLY bad, but, like, penis and stuff.

I'm pretty conservative, I've never had a gay friend or meaningfully interacted with a gay person in a personal capacity and I'm not the most social of people so things like clubbing don't really work. Despite being sort of unofficially out - my closest of friends know and everyone else sort of found out second hand - it's not discussed, nor do I really want it to be.

Despite being firmly of the belief that people are who they are and not having a problem with lgbti people of any ilk, I don't mentally or ideologically associate with them either. I don't really know what this means...
