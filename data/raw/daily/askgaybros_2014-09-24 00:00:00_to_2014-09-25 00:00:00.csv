I have been regularly dating and hooking up with this one guy for a couple weeks now.  We've gotten pretty close and have a ton in common.  I think he's pretty into me, and I could see me maybe dating him.

Recently, I met another really great guy on Tinder.  We've been on a couple dates so far.  We seem to click and (to be honest) he's way hotter.  I am still getting to know him, but I could see us ending up together as well.

My issue is: how do I handle this?  I don't want to hurt either of them.  I also don't want to have to ""choose"" yet, because I'm still getting to know Guy #2.  I can't tell if I'm just being shallow and want to stick with the second guy because he's hotter, or if because we have a genuinely better connection.

I feel much more excited when I'm getting ready to go on dates with Guy #2.  But I also have something great going on with Guy #1, and I don't want to lose something great and end up completely regretting it.

I also don&amp;#39;t want to have to &amp;quot;choose&amp;quot; yet, because I&amp;#39;m still getting to know Guy #2.  I can&amp;#39;t tell if I&amp;#39;m just being shallow and want to stick with the second guy because he&amp;#39;s hotter, or if because we have a genuinely better connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel much more excited when I&amp;#39;m getting ready to go on dates with Guy #2.  But I also have something great going on with Guy #1, and I don&amp;#39;t want to lose something great and end up completely regretting it.  Is there any good way to balance this situation and continue dating like this?  Or am I trying to have my cake and eat it too?&lt;/p&gt;

I've recently started going on dates with the purpose of finding a boyfriend. I'd had it with being lonely and not having anyone in my life who could be there for me and could love me (and whom I could love). 

I've had some trouble in the past in the love arena. I fell in love with my straight best friend and refused to move on for over 3 years. A guy in my campus org led me on and then told me he wasn't looking for anything. I've gone on dates that led nowhere.

But now I'm actually trying. I went on a couple dates with a guy from grindr, and that fizzled out (mainly because he was boring). Then there was another guy from okcupid. We got coffee last week and talked for about two hours. I'd never talked to a guy for that long and had it feel like such a short time. We seemed to click. We talked about doing something this past weekend, but then he never responded when I tried to follow up. I, not wanting to be ignored, asked him why. He said that he liked getting to know but isn't ""interested in anything right now."" 

Fine, if he's not interested then he's not interested. But I'm so tired of getting my hopes up only for them to be thrown to the ground. On the outside I'm a realist/pessimist. But on the inside I guess I've still been an optimist/idealist. I wonder if I should just give up on dating. I'm always someone's second choice or fall for guys who aren't interested. 

I know that dating is a numbers game. I know that I'll never meet anyone if I give up. But is it worth my ego taking a beating in the meantime? Please, I need help. I have no faith that the next guy I meet won't hurt me in some way. How do you guys deal with this?

Long back story short, imagine all the stereotypes of why a gay kid would be deathly terrified of coming out. Take away black skin and Mormonism and you have me. Dad literally told me (in a Church parking lot no less) that if I was gay, I would be disowned, taken out of the will, and kicked out of the house. This was when I was 10-12 years old, and even then I knew I was gay. Queue years of living in constant fear of being found out, killed, disowned, sent to a pray away the gay camp, I had no idea. All I knew is that whatever Dad says, goes, no if and or buts, no exception from me, mom, or sister. His house his rules. Also mom can't keep a secret for more than 10 minutes, so I had nowhere to turn for years (pre internet days)

So for the next 12-14 years I have been in a mental north korea, meticulously controlling all info shared with parents. To give some perspective, I was grounded for 3 months (90 days), had my door taken off its hinges for my room, was dragged from my bed, by the ear, to the basement and was forced to reread the 10 commandments from the bible, repeating the 5th one until I could not inhale or exhale from crying my ass off. For what you ask, I asked my mom to ""please shut up"" for explaining Simpsons voice actors from Fraser (sideshow bob/mel). Had asked her a bunch to wait till commercials, didn't and let loose with the ""shut up"". Holy fuck mistake. Theres more examples, but to keep it short, I'm pretty sure my dad can't get off unless he has recently broken a persons spirits/esteem/ego and can still hear them crying. Also Jews are kikes, blacks are niggers, gays are faggots etc. Hes ***that*** dad. I was/am literally waiting for him to die so I can start living my life not constantly fearing the people who are essentially supposed to love you no matter what.

[Was literally going to make this post on this day, but OP did it just before me](http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/2gc0r6/26_gay_no_social_lifeis_there_any_hope_for_me/). Only difference between us is I did the military instead of college out of highschool, other than that, I was shocked he knew my story so well.

Que last week, parents know I avoid the shit out of them (for the literal fear of death by being kicked out and dying on the streets) so ""call"" me down to talk (dad yells in his signature ""I am about to verbally destroy you"" kinda yell). Long story short, lots of them yelling, me crying, them then talking soft and sweet (Isn't that how you control people with Stockholm syndrome, make them feel completely worthless then tell them you love them/care for them.... yeah years of that). Say if I'm gay they are okay with it. I don't believe them. They keep pushing and proadging, say we are not leaving this conversation until I say whats up. 

I cave, I tell them, tell them what dad said about disowning me/kicking me out/taking me out of the will.  Mom says it makes so much sense, dad is all ""... well just so you know thats who I was then, I'm not that person anymore, I love you"" and some other bullshit, then goes directly to bed, as I was just keeping him up past his bed time. (Im sure you will say that is just my resentment talking, believe me its only half that)

And now we are acting like this ~~talk~~ interrogation never happened and its all back to being ""normal"". As if he never told his 10 year old child that if X condition is met, love converts to hate. Like I haven't been living with mental torture for years. As if his hate speeches where ""just a thing he did, hes from Trinidad that's how things where there"" (that was actually said by mom). It's as if I'm just supposed to pretend I had a happy child hood-teen years-20's. Honestly I don't remember a time I was happy. 

Now the parents are being extra nice, which sounds good, but I coulda used this niceness when I was 12, I couldn't care less if my dad called me a faggot these days, after all the years I've spent wanting/needing/yearning for him to kick the bucket. (That does sound harsh, I don't want him harmed/hurt etc. just hurry the fuck up old age)

Lastly, I was born with a slew of birth defects. 90% are unnoticeable, except for one. I don't cum. Nothing. No its not retrograde you googlers. And across the board, OKC, POF, grindr, scruff etc., if they cant get my cum in their body some how, they are no longer interested. Yes, dating sites AND sex apps alike, I can have week long conversations that go super well, and as soon as sex comes up and the find out, its ""sorry, but not interested"". For the love of pete, don't tell me the cliche ""thats good that happened, they aren't the kind of person you want to be with anyway"". I know this is a small sample since I've only just been able to pursue these apps and sites with face pics and the like, but I mainly want to reiterate that I have sadly finally started getting thoughts on just... giving up. Relationship/sexually/romantically/career wise, I just don't see a point coming this far in life and having done fucking nothing. Come here and to /r/topsandbottoms, and its a sea of people having more sex by the time their 18 than I will have in my life. I know thats very iffy and maybe not true, but I don't really even care if the future is brighter than now at this point, everyone is fucking doing better than me.


I just don't know what to do/think/feel. I've cried more this week than the past 10 years, dad gave me $2000 for a new mac book and I just see it as him trying to buy forgiveness or into my life or some shit, just gonna give it back. 

tl;dr: fuck it, I don't see a reason to do.... anything anymore, I don't see a point in anything, life is all backwards and shit can't be undone, what the fuck....","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know a lot of posts here take up at least a MB of text data, so I will do my best to be concise.&lt;/p&gt;

So I'm in my early 20's and I still go to my family practitioner because he's a great doctor and I've always had a pretty fun, yet professional relationship with him. I didn't go to him while in college and grad school, but since moving back to my home city, going back to him just made the most sense. I was closeted in high school so the first time I had to talk to him about a sexual health issue was today. I mentioned that ""someone"" I had been with had told me they tested positive for chlamydia. I said it off the cuff, but I was a bit terrified because he still goes to church with my parents (they wake me up with a call every Sunday to ask if I'd like to join). But he just chuckled, wrote me a prescription, and an order for my lab work. On his way out if the room, he put his hand on my shoulder and said ""It may not be the most fun, but condoms until you're married, it's the only way to go my boy!"" A huge sigh of relief washed over me as he walked out of the room, until he looked over his shoulder and says ""Even if she's on birth control!""

My question for you guys, How important is it that my doctor knows that I'm a (to use the medical term) MSM? I actually thought about asking him for truvada until I realized that he thought i was straight, not because I wanna bareback with strangers, just because I believe in being overly cautious, haha. I guess this can be a two-part question then. Who knows anything about the stigma of PreP? Whether it's being branded as someone at high risk for HIV on your medical records that you have to disclose to insurance companies and certain employers, or anything else. And do most insurers cover it? 

EDIT: Wow guys, thank you so much for your swift and thorough responses. This might be my new favorite subreddit! After reading your responses, I decided that some of you are right, even if he is ok with it, I don't think I'd be super comfortable discussing sexual health issues with him, eventhough he pretty much talked me through puberty. I started looking through the GLBT yellow pages for doctors that take my insurance. (If anyone is in the Houston area and has recommendations, please PM me) I hope all the guys that commented get a notification of this edit bc I want you to know how appreciative I am for you making this decision easier for me. Also I had one more tiny question, as I said before, a guy I got to grad school with told me he had chlamydia so I got tested and a prescription for azithromicin(?) from my doc yesterday. It was a single dose of 4 pills and I took them with dinner yesterday. At the risk of sounding like a slut, I was wondering if I did have it theoretically (I've exhibited no symptoms), at what point am I no longer contagious? A guy I knew when I lived in L.A. is town for a conference this weekend, lol. I told him about this when he asked if I could hang this weekend bc I believe in being forthright, but he says it should be ok. Just figured I'd ask you guys again to get a second take.

I started looking through the GLBT yellow pages for doctors that take my insurance. (If anyone is in the Houston area and has recommendations, please PM me) I hope all the guys that commented get a notification of this edit bc I want you to know how appreciative I am for you making this decision easier for me. Also I had one more tiny question, as I said before, a guy I got to grad school with told me he had chlamydia so I got tested and a prescription for azithromicin(?) from my doc yesterday. It was a single dose of 4 pills and I took them with dinner yesterday. At the risk of sounding like a slut, I was wondering if I did have it theoretically (I&amp;#39;ve exhibited no symptoms), at what point am I no longer contagious? A guy I knew when I lived in L.A. is town for a conference this weekend, lol. I told him about this when he asked if I could hang this weekend bc I believe in being forthright, but he says it should be ok. Just figured I&amp;#39;d ask you guys again to get a second take. &lt;/p&gt;

So today was going really well until I got home. Today has taught me that hope is immature - it likes to play games and take things off you when you've only just got them.

I got home from school and got in an argument with my friend (not the bro) about his GF and how I'm spending more time with her than he is. It got to a discussion about faults and I said that compared to him I really didn't have a lot (he is struggling with many insanity/health related issues). 

**This** is the point it came crashing down. TWENTY different screenshots of my closest friends and classmates detailing what they thought was bad about me. Heck, the 2 biggest things were personal - my intellect (I succeed where others fail) and my hair (like, really???). 

I don't know what to do:
* Write a blog post answering each ""fault"" and why they are wrong/right/misunderstood
* Ignore it, ignore it all and just carry on as usual holding grudges against the people I know who answered his call to arms
* Lash out and become even more cocky and arrogant than I apparently already are
