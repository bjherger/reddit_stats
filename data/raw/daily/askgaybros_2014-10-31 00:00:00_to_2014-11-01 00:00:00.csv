This was already sort of on the table when we met so it wasn't any surprise.  

However, we really did hit it off.  Much more than I had expected.  To the extent that we met each other's families and spent a *lot* of time together in those six weeks.  To the extent that I am really interested in something serious with him and would be willing to wait until he theoretically moved back from his AmeriCorps assignment.  To the extent that I flew out to visit him for five days - I'm currently in Albuquerque now.  

He joined AmeriCorps and moved to another city for his assignment for reasons that I totally get.  He wasn't getting anywhere with a career, he was living at home, and wanted to pull himself out of the doldrums and start his own life.  But this also has him considering staying in Albuquerque at the end of his contract.  

I have never felt about someone like I feel about him.  I'm trying very hard to avoid falling down the rabbit hole of becoming too emotionally invested since I know we may not have a shot together in the long run.  I also know I can't reasonably expect him to factor me into his decision on whether to stay in Albuquerque or move back home - we only dated for six weeks, after all.  I don't think he's as intensely interested in me as I am in him, but he also has a breakup from a LTR in his recent past.  I think he is also much more cautious with his emotions than I am.  

But damn it if I'm not already pretty damn invested (read: calm and collected emotional wreck).  I would not say that I am ""in love"" with him, but I certainly could be with the slightest push in that direction.  I feel like I want to make him happy and be there for him.

I am more venting than anything else.  I have told him how I feel - at least I think I have - but I really just can't stand the thought of not having him around in the long term.  The thought literally brings tears to my eyes - and there aren't many things that can do that.  To be honest I didn't even know it was possible for me to react to someone in this way.

Im about as inexperienced in relationships as it gets. Since i was a kid ive been pretty overweight, albeit slowly getting thinner as ive grown to now be a relatively average 18 year old. As well as that im aware of 3 gay people in my town which include

An older widowed man i havnt met but have heard about.

One of my best friends of 4-5 years who i am not interesting in relationship wise.

And me.

As such ive never been in a relationship and ive yet to even kiss a man. In about 3 months ill be moving out of home and to the Australian city of Brisbane for University and im hoping that on the many visits im going to be making between now and then(my brother lives there so i visit often) that i can kind of meet someone. The problem im coming up against is that i want to meet other men and begin actually being a romantically involved adult but im not really the person for hook up or grindr type engagements and im kind of unsure about how and/or where to find other gay people without assuming we're going to fuck and be on our ways.

For the sake of sanity and clarity these are the questions in specifics:

Is a gay bar or even regular bar the right place to meet people for more than one night stands?

Are there any dating type apps that are for longer term relationship things and if so has anyone had any success/ would recommend any specifically?

Is it a good idea to start a relationship with someone who could very well have a lot more experience than me by confessing my inexperience or would this just kind of scare them off?

Ive heard that there are quite a few University/community groups for meeting other people, are there any Brisbane gaybros who could recommend one as ive found they tend to be pretty word of mouth or i just dont know where to look.

And as a final slog to the nuts, my other gay friend is under 18, not moving out of home and so cant really accompany me on my escapades.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;First some explanations.&lt;/p&gt;

I was talking with 2 guys on dating apps and eventually I went on some dates with one of them. As I was seeing someone, even if casually, I stopped contacting the other guy and we eventually stopped chatting.

Both were interesting and it all went down to a race of who would ask me out first basically.

My relationship with my family hasn't always been perfect. Growing up (I am the youngest) I have felt overshadowed by my brothers. They both are very skilled at sports and have been popular and just tend to receive more of the attention. I on the other hand am more artistic and somewhat more reserved. I have gotten more outgoing as I have gotten older but. I still feel that since I haven't proven to be as successful/popular as my brothers, my parents don't treat me in the same way. This could all be in my head, but I have felt it ever since I was young.

I was also, as I mentioned, not really popular in high school and was bullied for acting gay (I wasn't out at the time) and it really took a toll on my mental health. Today, I struggle with clinical depression and anxiety and am doing my best to cope with it and live day by day. I take a medication that sort of helps with the depression. With that back story out of the way...

I have been dating this guy for about 3 months now and everything is going really well. We get along amazingly, we can talk about anything or do anything and I don't feel weird. I am (for the most part) really happy I am with him and want it to continue for a long long time. Unfortunately, due to my lack of self-esteem among other mental issues, I struggle ALOT with insecurity.

He lives in a city about 30 miles away so I usually see him on weekends and a day during the week. I would consider him to probably have a bigger friend group than me and that is just fine I know it's healthy. But when I am alone at home, I just eat myself up with negative thoughts. I am constantly worrying ""Is he talking to someone else?"", ""Is he sending/receiving pics from other dudes?"", ""Does he think I am a loser because I don't have a lot of friends?"" and stuff to that extent. I get really racy thoughts when he doesn't reply for a long time to texts and I even made the HORRIBLE decision to go through his phone on two separate occasions (I have since admitted to him and apologized deeply.)

Part of me rationally knows I am being really paranoid and that it could affect our relationship and I need to give him more benefit of the doubt. Yet of course my more overpowering anxious/depressive side tells me completely otherwise. I asked my friend and she suggested therapy and I have tried counseling a few times but I always end up not going back after a handful of sessions and I know that is super counteractive. However, because I have had serious moments involving suicidal thoughts I am starting to think I might have to change that pattern.

This is somewhat of a vent post, but has anyone ever dealt with insecurity to this extent? I really don't want mental health issues to bog down this awesome relationship because I know he isn't having the same thoughts or dealing with these problems. Should I talk to him about it? Should I try therapy again? I feel extremely lost and powerless...

Lets get down to business:

when i was 17, I left some bear porn site up on the family computer. My parents, not knowing what to do, sat me down and made me confess. This was the first time I ever said i was gay.

Instead of accepting that I had come out, I would just never bring up the subject. I began talking less and less over the years. This, and depression, worsened until I spent the last 2 years not having conversations.

I've never had a boyfriend, or even been on a date. Instead, I formed a series of unhealthy, dependent relationships with straight guys. 

I am over it. I want cuddles. And not just platonic cuddles!

Fortunately, I felt proud to be gay for the first time this last week, and have since come out to my parents (on my terms), and made peace with them about that unfortunate day i was 17.

So here we are. Me, a woefully inexperienced homosexual, and you, the bros who might be able to help me.

♥Lion

PS - I may add to this story later, but my computer is about to restart on me... ok go

So; advice. I have no idea what to do, but I need your help to keep me from relapsing into a straight guy friendship. It seems there are too many things that need to be done, but I don't know what any of those things are, yet...

I moved back home temporarily after finishing a job in another state. Now I live with my mom, dad, second oldest brother. Mainly my dad and brother were two pretty terrible people in my life. My brother like my other siblings have always been accepting of me being gay. My parents not so much because they are mega christian. Although I wasn't expecting to reconnect with my family members, I feel like I should use the time I am here with them to do so.

But then it dawned on me that they never really ask me any personal questions. They don't know much about my job and they don't know who my other friends are. 

Granted, I'm older and I'm 26, but I just always feel annoyed being here because I feel like I'm just here to do people favors like drive them from point a to point b, pick up food at the grocery store, etc. We haven't spoken about the other aspects of my life at all. Partially, I'm pretty emotionally shut from their original rejection to my coming out, so I guess that's still a bloody wound to me as some horrible things were said.

AT THIS POINT IN LIFE, I feel like I shouldn't care, but I do. I've never had anyone close to me die and my lack of empathy has made me a pretty cold person, so I don't feel like I would care if they die, but I know they've done so much for me. This isn't something that haunts me everyday, but it's certainly a fork in the road. They will always be religious and never change, so I always feel like I just need to be my own hero, warrior, and suck it up. I have my big brother who lives in another state and who always cares about what's going on with me even if we give each other shit all the time (I teared up thinking about this because we weren't close growing up). I'm grateful to have that relationship and feel like I should pick my battles and just smile and then walk away when I move back to the state where my brother is. I have a sister as well who is pretty much with a person. I have friends. But I thought, when in Rome, if I should give it a shot and CHOOSE to forge better relationships with my new roommates.
