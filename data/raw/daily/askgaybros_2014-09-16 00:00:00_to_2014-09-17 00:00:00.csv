As stated in my previous posts, we have a very close friendship. 

He's always very affectionate when drunk and recently began to cross the line from affectionate to sexual (licking my ear, trying to slip a hand under my shirt etc.) When sober, he'd conveniently forget all about his advances.

I finally told him that he was putting me in an awkward position - I like him, I find him attractive but I don't want to be his drunk hook-up.  I don't want to be his drunken experiment or damage our friendship. I said I was happy to stay platonic friends with him but he needed to respect my boundaries. 

After I told him this, he did some soul searching, broke up with his female FWB and told me he'd like to try dating me. I'm very attracted to him, he's a great person and I'd love to date him.

But I have some reservations:

1. He is adamant that he isn't gay or bi in the slightest. He says he doesn't like men - he just likes me. Obviously the fact he wants to be with a man suggests he is at least bi. I don't if he's ready for a relationship if he's still battling to accept his sexuality.

2. He's my best friend. If this goes wrong, I don't want to lose him as a friend.

3. I'm unsure how open he'll be about being in a relationship with a man. One of my exes was still in the closet and it put a huge strain on the relationship.

I have been processing since summer and I have passed ASVAB and Physical without any problem, and now all there is left is going to MEPS to sign the contract and swear in and I'm officially a soldier. That's scheduled to happen next week but now I'm getting nervous, for two reasons:

1. A fellow gay bro I know who joined the Army earlier this year had a bad experience at his first duty station: somehow the company commander found out he's gay and ordered him to always shower alone, which led to everybody else also knowing he's gay and since then the guys have all distanced themselves from him and there are also the occasional slurs tossed his way.

2. I have a long-running military fetish though that's not why I want to join the Army. I have pretty strong self-control and have never made my straight guy friends uncomfortable even though I spent my life playing sports and hanging out with them. But I can't help worrying that one of those days I'm gonna get drunk or something and let my guard down and look at someone the wrong way and get myself into trouble. This being the military even though now that DADT is gone the culture is still quite homophobic in general.

What do y'all think bros? Should I go through with this or should I run before I end up being miserable but locked in a 4-year contract and have no way out.

Thanks a lot!

Just looking for some advice on a work matter.  Some background first, I currently work for a large healthcare unit in Utah which is known pretty well nationally if you follow healthcare news.  I've been in my current position for 6 months, prior to that another position in the company for 4 years.  I am having some issues with my boss.

This is not really gay related or maybe it is.  Anyway, in my position I'm exposed to a lot of sick patients and have been sick multiple times since I've started, I've called in once since I started and then again today, as this is my 3rd sinus infection in 3 months.  My boss requested that I bring in a doctor's note, which has caused me to be to be upset, maybe even irrationally.  Multiple people I work with especially 2 of my boss's close friends have called in and I really doubt she has made them bring a note in, I've even heard my boss mention how she doesn't require notes from her employees after her friend was making fun of some kid he forced to get a doctors note at his full time position (he does this job part time).  This is just one example where I think she is being unfair to me.

I'm a pretty passive guy, I take shifts for people when they're sick or can't work for whatever reason almost weekly, if I ask anyone to help me out they almost always say no and my boss has even told me that I should just stick to the schedule and not try to change it, even though EVERYONE does.  I feel very singled out.

I do very good job, but I have extreme anxiety and I think my friends are tired of hearing me complaining about work but not doing anything about it.  So I guess this post is mostly just looking for advice on how to handle job positions where you feel singled out by your boss, you feel you're treated unfairly and you're pretty passive so you let things happen without putting up a fight. 

I really need this job, I'm probably going to look for another position in the company soon but I was hoping to stick this out till I graduate school which will be in a year.  Sorry if this post is jumbled and mixed up but I'm under the weather and having pretty bad anxiety that I'm going to get a warning or written up tomorrow even though I actually got a doctor's note today and haven't done anything really wrong.  Anyway, any advice is much welcome.  I'm also willing to clarify anything or add on. 

Thanks for reading.

edit: I feel like there aren't a lot of examples of me being singled out or me being treated unfairly, so a couple more would be - I've been forced to work a lot of overtime even when I had a one on one discussion with my boss about not wanting overtime, the week before last I worked 50 hours in 4 days straight, no one else that week had overtime, I emailed my boss to leave early one day and have one of the part time people pick up some hours and was told ""I really need you to stick to the schedule"", this was right after she emailed us and said we needed to watch our overtime...  When I emailed my boss about going back to school, I was told that my school schedule didn't really work with the full time schedule she wanted me to work and that if I chose school I would be reduced back to part time, losing my health insurance benefits.  This is Utah, I am not Mormon, 99% of people are nice to my face but will talk about church stuff around me, including my boss, which automatically isolates me.  I have a lot of things working against me I think; I'm gay, I'm overweight and I'm Native American.  I keep reading that Utah is a right to work state and that I can be fired for any reason really, so I'm just really paranoid and anxious all the time, I do not know what to do.  I can't quit because I desperately need the money.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys,&lt;/p&gt;

So there is this guy that I really like. Very attractive Athletic cub, sweet;Etc. Anyways I lived with him last semester. we hung out sometimes before then but we were not really close friends. Before when i was just getting to know him, he used to show hella signs of curiosity (I don't just go after any old straighty). 
      HE used to get super upset whenever someone would say some homophobic shit to me angrily replying "" there's nothing wrong with being gay!!"" he would say things like ""I feel think everyone is a little bisexual."" I started to get my hopes up at that point. After I got to know him even more, I found out a whole lot more shit.He is obsessed with Rugby, wrestling, and basically every single hella homoerotic sport. He looks into other guys eyes way too long especially mine (you know what I mean). He loves to give massages to guys. When my other roommates asked me what my type was, I basically described him. During this time he started hooking up with one of my best girl friends.  So anyways once him and this girl stopped hooking up, he eventually found out I liked him. We took it pretty well, in fact he was upset that i didn't tell him. However he was in love with my friend ( who didnt want anything to do with him at this point. When he first found out, he was super homophobic and a little distant towards me. but things went back to normal soon. He is still always saying shit like ""who knows I could end up with a guy."" and he will now go on rants about how easy gay ppl have it. He even said ""my family would probably like me more if I ever came out of the closet.""  I never even told him that I liked him to his face, but he will bring it up time to time in a kind of offhanded rude way like ""It's not ,y fault I'm hyper sensitive to gay guys liking me"" and will smile at me like he is being cute. 
     Ohh and while all of this is happening I forgot to mention, THIS KID IS FALLING APART! He is hella depressed he gained a lot of weight, he has a lot of insecurity issues especially when it comes to his masculinity. he is always trying to get in fights that he can't win. He is a big alcoholic and and addict in general. HE has tried to fight me once but he has also gotten in a fight with a guy who made fun of me for liking him. HE desperately tried to be with my best friend but she was not feeling it. he hooks up with hella girls but struggles to get it up (most likely because he is usually wasted.) One time we were on a bus and there where too smoking hot cubs in front of us cuddling. once they left he called them insecure because they were not being very intimate in front of us.  I think I might have made him more homophobic because now he makes more homophobic jokes and says faggot and shit ( I do this too.) On top of all of this he has so much potential and he is getting better now. He is taking a semester off because he messed up his grades but he is comming back next semester and i ave a choice to live with him in a house. I still kind of like him but things are just so fucked up bros. what should I do? part of me has even thought about dropping him as a friend all together, he doesn't even talk to me or any of our friends because he is at home alone.

During this time he started hooking up with one of my best girl friends.  So anyways once him and this girl stopped hooking up, he eventually found out I liked him. We took it pretty well, in fact he was upset that i didn&amp;#39;t tell him. However he was in love with my friend ( who didnt want anything to do with him at this point. When he first found out, he was super homophobic and a little distant towards me. but things went back to normal soon. He is still always saying shit like &amp;quot;who knows I could end up with a guy.&amp;quot; and he will now go on rants about how easy gay ppl have it. He even said &amp;quot;my family would probably like me more if I ever came out of the closet.&amp;quot;  I never even told him that I liked him to his face, but he will bring it up time to time in a kind of offhanded rude way like &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s not ,y fault I&amp;#39;m hyper sensitive to gay guys liking me&amp;quot; and will smile at me like he is being cute. 
     Ohh and while all of this is happening I forgot to mention, THIS KID IS FALLING APART! He is hella depressed he gained a lot of weight, he has a lot of insecurity issues especially when it comes to his masculinity. he is always trying to get in fights that he can&amp;#39;t win. He is a big alcoholic and and addict in general. HE has tried to fight me once but he has also gotten in a fight with a guy who made fun of me for liking him. HE desperately tried to be with my best friend but she was not feeling it. he hooks up with hella girls but struggles to get it up (most likely because he is usually wasted.) One time we were on a bus and there where too smoking hot cubs in front of us cuddling. once they left he called them insecure because they were not being very intimate in front of us.  I think I might have made him more homophobic because now he makes more homophobic jokes and says faggot and shit ( I do this too.) On top of all of this he has so much potential and he is getting better now. He is taking a semester off because he messed up his grades but he is comming back next semester and i ave a choice to live with him in a house. I still kind of like him but things are just so fucked up bros. what should I do? part of me has even thought about dropping him as a friend all together, he doesn&amp;#39;t even talk to me or any of our friends because he is at home alone. &lt;/p&gt;

I have never done anything with another guy in my life - no one would ever expect me to be gay.  I've had girlfriends in the past, and my longest relationship was my last girlfriend (6 months).  To be honest, I don't know if I'm bisexual or gay.  After so many years of my life I'm finally accepting that I am NOT straight because of the fact that I watch gay porn and straight porn.  (btw, This is a throwaway account.) 

I have only one gay friend who I'm debating on telling to possibly help my situation out.  At the same time though, I feel like him and I aren't even that close, and I don't know if he'd want to help at all.  Plus him and I are also very different people.  

I got the Tinder app and made my preferences to men and women - (I thought it was safe since only people interested can see your profile + your profile doesn't even state what you prefer.)  This was a big deal/step for me, and I actually talked to some guys, but nothing happened in terms of a meet-up, and I'm not really having any matches with guys nowadays, it seems like there are A LOT more straight women who are looking than gay guys.  I recently just turned it off.

The back of my mind, I'm also thinking there's a possibility of me not even liking it once I try it - I don't mean to be disrespectful but in real life (Not porn) I feel like I'd be disgusted if I got crap on your penis or mouth through anal play, because can't that happen even if you clean in the shower beforehand?

In terms of my personality/relationships, I'm not really the type of guy who enjoys clubbing, every girl I've been with has been through a small get together, or through a friend, and even then, it's not like we'd go really far sexually right away, it'd be a couple weeks of dating before I'd feel comfortable to have sex.  

The dream situation would be if I magically met a guy who's going through exactly what I'm going through, and we get to know each other, like each other, and then see what happens when we experiment.

I don't know what to do, this whole situation seems hopeless, I don't know where to turn.  A part of me feels like do I go to a gay club by myself and see what happens?  Do I try more online stuff?  Has anyone been through this and could give advice about how their situation turned out?  

Anyways, any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Unnecessary details of our meetings are below.

---

**Guy One:**

This was 2+ months ago, so details have been forgotten.

I went to a gay club with a friend, and we bumped into some of his friends along with their friends. We all socialized and drank, and one of these drunk friends kept trying to dance with me and kiss me. I turned each attempted kiss into an awkward hug so that our lips wouldn't touch

He handed me his phone to add me on FB, so I felt forced to become FB friends with him. He asked if I'm going to ignore his messages in the future, and I felt forced to say no.

---

**Guy Two:**

We met last weekend at my friend's birthday party, which was at a casino/hotel. The birthday boy is gay, and most of the guests were gay. I only knew the birthday boy and his brother.

Guy Two said among a group of people, ""I was trying to flirt with him (he pointed at me), but he's straight as fuck.""  
Before this, I truly didn't know he was trying to flirt with me. This led to some vague conversation among people about my sexuality. Finally, Guy Two straight-up asked, ""What are you?""  
I replied, ""I'm gay.""  
He and some others exclaimed, ""Really!?"" I found this awkward so I walked out of the room (lol).

Shortly after, Guy Two walked up to me, said, ""I'm sorry,"" and hugged me.  
I asked, ""For what?""  
He replied, ""For everything.""  
I said, ""It's fine.""  
I guess he felt bad for asking about my sexuality in front of people, or he wanted an excuse to talk to me and hug me.

Later in the night he sat on a stool and kept waving me over. He then would hug me and I would awkwardly stand there and feel unable to get out of his hug. This happened 2-3 more times.

Much later, I was resting on a bed. He joined me, rested his head on my stomach, cuddled me, and moved my hand to rest on him.

Even later, he said he was afraid that he's too loud for me. I said it's okay, as long as he's not that way 24/7. He then called me ""cute"" twice and said he likes my personality.

Of course, right before I left the party, he had to hug me one more time.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr:&lt;/strong&gt; I met two different guys on two different days.

I'm 25, gay, finally getting my depression mostly under control and i'm sick of being on my own. For the longest of time i loved being on my own -still do a bit- but now it's just turning into loneliness. I have a few friends, but we don't really hang out a lot, and mostly when we do, i feel like i'm not necessarily contributing to the conversation because i don't know how or what to talk about :x I''ve never been the one to make a lot of friends for that matter, and i was always fine with it, as i had people online to talk to. But now, i just want to start to properly live, not escape on the internet all day every day. I don't want that anymore!

The thing is, i just want to make some friends, go out, do crazy things, go places, ... but  I haven't got the faintest idea how to start on this. I've tried social groups but all the accessable ones are too sporty, churchy, 50+, 20-. or tied to a specific uni/college. Bars and clubs is something i don't enjoy too much but want to try. I just feel rediculous going on my own, and the fact i absolutely hate the taste of most alcoholic drinks isn't helping because i never join in on the drinking.

I ended up trying to meet people through sites and apps but 95% of answers i get are 35+ year old horny guys, or a plain ""eh.. no?"". I've been on a few dates but all ended in a ""yeah i don't feel about it like you do"" or just in plain being ignored. i know i'm not that attractive but jeez x.x  I just don't know anymore, nothing i try seems to work to make friends (or meet someone for that matter).  I just want to get to know some people to hang out with, to ahve fun with, to talk to and what not. Howcome it seems so easy for others while it feels impossible to me =x

so i turn to you guys, do you have any more tips, anything i can try, anything at all? Because i'm kinda losing hope and i don't want to give up on this just yet. I just don't know where to go from here anymore.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as the title says, i just can&amp;#39;t figure it out for the life of me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m 25, gay, finally getting my depression mostly under control and i&amp;#39;m sick of being on my own. For the longest of time i loved being on my own -still do a bit- but now it&amp;#39;s just turning into loneliness. I have a few friends, but we don&amp;#39;t really hang out a lot, and mostly when we do, i feel like i&amp;#39;m not necessarily contributing to the conversation because i don&amp;#39;t know how or what to talk about :x I&amp;#39;&amp;#39;ve never been the one to make a lot of friends for that matter, and i was always fine with it, as i had people online to talk to. But now, i just want to start to properly live, not escape on the internet all day every day. I don&amp;#39;t want that anymore!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing is, i just want to make some friends, go out, do crazy things, go places, ... but  I haven&amp;#39;t got the faintest idea how to start on this. I&amp;#39;ve tried social groups but all the accessable ones are too sporty, churchy, 50+, 20-. or tied to a specific uni/college. Bars and clubs is something i don&amp;#39;t enjoy too much but want to try. I just feel rediculous going on my own, and the fact i absolutely hate the taste of most alcoholic drinks isn&amp;#39;t helping because i never join in on the drinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up trying to meet people through sites and apps but 95% of answers i get are 35+ year old horny guys, or a plain &amp;quot;eh.. no?&amp;quot;.

I recently ended my relationship of a little over a year. The back story is that there is this guy, I'll call him Jay. Jay is pretty amazing; great person, always makes me laugh, perfect mix of handsome and cute, and he's always been super into me and makes me feel like I'm awesome. What happened? Well Jay has always joked he hates living where we are (Boston), and I never took him seriously, but a few months ago he told me that he received a job offer in SF and he was going to submit a resume. That didn't pan out but that really started to shake my world, because I realized that one day he could just pick up and leave and I would effectively have no idea. (I have a very solid 4 year contract that I can't break without some pretty severe damage to my career)


Well this started to make me feel insecure and began to fester. I felt like our relationship in many senses was stuck in cruise control since I was not comfortable moving forward (e.g. moving in and whatever), and he was not either. Plus the lack of security from constantly worrying about it ending because of a job offer. I realized I couldn't be in a relationship like that. So I ended it, and Jay understands, although he's not happy. There was no nastiness associated with it, and so we have continued to hang out, sleepover, etc, just there is no more title. 

After the breakup I feel relieved. In many senses I have missed the luxuries of being single (being on my own schedule, sleeping in my own apartment, picking up my old hobbies, working out more, etc.). I definitely don't want anything serious for a while. 


But Jay is getting more and more sad. Sometimes he starts to tear up when we are hanging out and I have to leave or I mention doing something without him. I think it makes it worse that I am handling this better than he is (this is his first breakup so i think he might be feeling some major despair but this is not my first). He also thinks that it's his fault I wanted to break up (even though I keep reassuring him that I was not unhappy with him, just the situation)

I guess I just don't know what to do; it's pretty painful for me to watch him get upset, and I'm not sure if me continuing to hang out with him is doing harm or good. I guess I'm asking how you would want to be treated in this situation by your ex, and what would be the least painful way of ending it.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi reddit - This is a long post so I apologize in advance but I think some back story is helpful for these posts so I included some detail.&lt;/p&gt;

I  believe he has a sexual addiction of some kind.  cybersex addiction or  something of that nature. We  have sex,  great sex.  He enjoys himself, I  enjoy myself.  He tells me I'm the best partner he's ever had etc. Its hard enough  trying to deal with all of the other bs  and lies  but what I can't get over  is the question,  is he gay?  I'm  not homophobic by any means,  but I don't want to waste any more time with a man who has already hurt me. Obviously,  I've asked him about it.  He says he's not gay. Says, if  anything he was bicurious  for a little while and  that he's not anymore. 
Is  this normal? Is  he lying to me? To  himself? How can I  know  for sure?
