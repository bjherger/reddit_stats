So I'm a curious. Am I gay? Bi? Straight? .. I would say I was straight but curious but not sure.

Also I realised when I have watched gay porn I seem to imagine myself being the bottom.
Being the one suckng on the cock and taking it deep in the ass.
But does that actually feel good?? What does it feel like to have a man inside you?? And if you go bareback and he shoots inside of you do you feel it? What does that feel like?

TL;DR- I recognize my problem is probably multi-layered, but I really would like help on one thing- when you ""flirt"" with a guy in a non-gay setting, how do you overcome the fear of realizing he's straight? How do you test the waters?

So I was at my university's caf sitting with a younger student I'm mentoring (I'm a senior) and I was non-chalantly hardcore checking this guy out. He was sitting with his friends and I didn't think he noticed until he started looking a lot towards my direction. I have a tendency to think people are staring at me so I didn't think anything of it. I also thought he was out of my league, so I was just enjoying the eye candy/picturing me riding him. 

BUT THEN his friends left and he lingered around, got up, looked at me and very slowly packed up. I panicked. The guy I'm sitting with doesn't know I'm gay and I'm not comfortable being completely open/ I'm ambiguously straight at my school. It's also not professional to flirt right in front of him. Then the guy as he was leaving casually said hey how's it going, and I just nodded and looked away...which made things awkward and the guy left. IT WAS THE WORST AND I FEEL TERRIBLE because I know that took guts and not responding is awful.

In my defense, THE GUY LOOKED STRAIGHT so I thought he was going to comment on my excessive staring or something and how it made him uncomfortable. In hindsight, he was probably receptive and I missed my chance as I'm never in that building. The worst part is, this exact scenario happened to me before when I was at a jack astor's with my buds (who thought I was straight at the time, out to them now) and it happened a few times at the gym, but I'm not too sure cause everybody looks at everybody and eventually talk to each other.

So essentially, eyeing guys and hoping they're gay is my only effective dating method. What do I do? How do I overcome my fear of hitting on straight guys? Is there ""a test"" that I can do?

EDIT: Took out the part where I was crying and slamming my keyboard.

UPDATE: THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIPS. I looked at it as just potentially meeting a new friend and that it doesn't need to go anywhere. I've been going to that caf to run into him since and I just did!!!!! We sat down and talked and he looked nervous too so I just talked to him like I talk to my friends and it ended with him asking me to add him on Facebook!

Throughout high school I was extremely overweight and had no confidence. I wasn't in any serious relationships and never had sex. When I joined college I was overweight still but I slowly came out of my shell. After a couple years in college I decided to join the military and lost a serious amount of weight (&gt;100lbs). Let's just say my confidence went wayyy up. I have honestly been quite the slut lately(safe always). Everyone was automatically super interested in me, flirted with me, and made me feel super attractive. I fell in love with the game and the idea of first meeting a guy and then seducing them. I became what I swore I never would. They would always try to message me after to hang out again and I would almost always ignore them. I have to admit that I also had relationship problems in the past which has made me question if the validity of  relationships (most of my family have divorced, my last relationship with a man was a shipwreck, and the last time I was in a relationship with a female she cheated on me with my brother [story for another time])  I try to not use it as an excuse but I can't help it. 

Lately, I've haven't been sleeping around as much and decided to actually give this guy I've been talking to for a couple weeks a chance. I waited two weeks before we had sex, but he did lose his virginity to me. He's a very sweet guy and we have a lot of fun/ laugh a lot when we hang out. When I'm around him he doesn't really give me a reason to believe that he isn't into me. Yesterday we didn't hang out and he hasn't really been texting me like normal. I feel like one of those guys that I use to ignore. I feel like being honest with him about what my intentions are but I don't want to weird him out and scare him away.  

*&amp; I know karma is a bitch and a lot of people will probably say that I deserve it. It honestly feels like shit when I finally let my guard down and realize that there is a chance that I will be proven right about everything I have believed about relationships in the past. Any advice? ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;GAYBROSSS, I NEED your advice. Throughout high school I was extremely overweight and had no confidence.
