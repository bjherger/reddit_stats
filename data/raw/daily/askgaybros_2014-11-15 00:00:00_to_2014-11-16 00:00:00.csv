A simple question for you guys. Does anyone else irrationally feel insecure with their partner even after being guaranteed that you're everything they want/need?

How do you deal with trust issues even when you know he's not being unfaithful?

How do you get overt not feeling worthy of his love?

I have alot of self confidence and esteem issues that I'm trying to fight. But don't feel as if I'm getting anywhere. I love him with everything i have. He says he loves me too just as much.

At the school I attend there is little to no people that come out as gay which turns relationships into a whole new battleground having to guess if they are gay or not and not messing up and causing an all out war with people. As a result, I don't know how to tell if they're  gay as well as starting a relationship together.  Also, I get the reverse as well, girls flirting with me and I don't know how to break it to them that I'm not interested in them without crushing their feelings. This loneliness also does narrow the things I possess to entertain myself which leads to boredom and bad ideas. Thanks so much bros and any help is greatly appreciated.

A few months ago I met this great guy and started falling for him rather quickly which is fairly out of the ordinary for me. I'd see him every few days and really thought I might be finding something special for the first time. We have a ton in common and his personality type is the type that I could see myself being with for the long term... the only thing I saw we lacked was any sexual chemistry. A few weeks later I brought up taking things to the next step he said he wanted to take it slow, which I was completely fine with.


Anyhow, a few weeks after that he asked me again about my thoughts of taking things forward, and I told him very candidly how great of a guy I think he is and how much I was still hoping to. After that he decided to tell me that he wasn't feeling the same, and that he'd rather be friends. This really bummed me out since he decided to tell me after I put my heart on my sleeve. I don't blame him for his feelings, because you really can't control something like that.


Since then, we have remained good friends. We still talk very regularly and hang out sometimes (though not as much as before). It stays completely platonic and I'm fine with that... he's a great guy and I don't want to lose the friendship we've built. 


My problem is when he tells me about his time seeing other guys. I'm not expecting or holding out for him to come back, but the wounds are still fresh. It really hurts when he talks to me about these great guys who completely click with him... makes me feel inadequate. I know I will move on, but that's how I feel right now.

I really want to support and be there for him, but it really crushes me for him to talk about his romantic endeavors. How can I make it easier for me to talk about that sort of thing with him? Should I explain to him that it's still a touchy subject for me at the moment? I don't want him to feel like I don't care or think that I'm still trying to be with him.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey bros&lt;/p&gt;

When it comes to relationships, i'm incredibly insecure. despite being 25, i've only had 3 relationships, of which two ended with ""yeah i kinda never really loved you, just thought of you as a friend. "" which killed the already more then just a little crooked selfimage and selfconfidence i had. Oh, and one of those was for 2 years long. he just kept it quiet because he liked the attention i gave him. The third one was long distance (don't judge), which is also why we broke it up. Fair enough, i'm not that good looking, but it's not like i'm that monstrous, i think. 

i'm trying really hard to build up all that again, and i'm trying to date again but I can't help but notice how fast i fall for someone. I feel like it goes well and i start getting attached to the guy really quickly. Not that I want to, it just happens, and the more i struggle, the worse it gets -.-  And it scares them off, for obvious reasons xD  One guy just started ignoring my every word, not sure if it's for that reason but still. it's not that i go all creepy stalker on them or propose first date, but i just like seeing eachother at times, and  i like affection and i like showing it. I guess i tend to tell people what i like about them, or that i like them, too fast, since people don't really do that for me.  And i'm a bit a romantic, i'm the guy who buys - and has bought- a rose for someone's birthday if i think they'll like it. my friends call it admirable but hopeless, haha :p

the thing is, i feel like i'm clingy. And i don't know what to do. I know (almost) nobody likes someone who is clingy, but I don't know how to stop it. how to remain casual and just take it slow.

I'mdating someone now and he already says things are going too fast, although he hasn't had time with his studies at all, and has to spend tons of time on his assignments and projects, and we haven't seen eachother for three weeks. Each time he agrees to meet up, he's too busy, or is out with his friends instead or something else. We literally ahven't had a date that hasn't been delayed or moved.  and i'm feeling like i'm just whiny asking to see him again, like i'm pushing it too far and i don't want to be that guy that goes all ""wanna go out wanna go out wanna go out wanna go out"" and i feel like i'm sufficating him, it's just, i can't help but get scared. these things are really playing into my insecurities. i'm just wanting to see him again and not be lead on. I do like him, and really do want to build up a relationship but i haven't got the faintest clue what he thinks at this point. Everything is amazing when we're actually together, but getting that to happen seems to take half a miracle.


Okay, i know i'm a field of red flags, feel free to tell me that all you wish, i'm fully aware.

I am attracted to gay porn, but couldnt see myself in a relationship with a guy, one friend who I have been with put it ""........ could you wake up in the morning next to a guy, or a girl. What ever one it is, shows who you can fall in love with"" and I just cant see myself having a guy sleep over etc. Is it just a physical thing?

If I was out in public with a guy, I just cant see myself showing PDA or even holding hands. On the other hand, females I have no problem with, and enjoy it. Is this just adhering to social norms and expectations or is this me not wanting to actually have a bf.

The question is, why do I keep going to gay porn as inspiration for personal time, if I think I am not gay, just use it as a way to get 'off'

I am quite confused and feel that at my age, I should of worked it all out, Any advice would be great, from you guys or even people who have been in the same situation.

I have been a reddit user for a while, but changed the username, so had to start fresh.

Thanks again,","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So heres the deal, I am a 28 year old male, delayed in life so just graduated from college. (did things before college). I have a story and I want to share if this is a normal, natural or occurring thing?&lt;/p&gt;
