I've not had a previous relationship, and I've not even kissed or held hands with a guy.

I'd like to though.

How can I go from zero to having sex with a stranger I think is hot?

There are so many hot guys on campus, and I secretly dream of cuddling and making out with them and I'm ashamed to say I'm too much anxious and uncertain to actually act on my desires in real life. I place everybody else on a pedestal and I get awkward and tense and can't be myself if I meet someone I'm attracted to. If they talk to me, I might stammer because it's like a dream come true. 

How have you guys done it?

Do you guys just go for what you want? I feel like that's how people get things, whether it's experiences or relationships. They don't overthink it.

My problem has always been that I haven't tried. It's like I start out believing it isn't possible, or that these hot guys can't be for me. It's unhealthy, I know, and as long as I act this way I'll really chase myself out of every opportunity. I just want to know, supposing these issues weren't as bad and I actually took a chance, what should I do?

Is this what a hook up is for?

Oh also, a friend I'm not attracted to (who isn't attracted to me and is mostly straight) has offered to cuddle sometime since he said he also wasn't sure of his sexuality. He's totally cool and outgoing. I'd almost like to accept just because I'm sick of not having any experiences under my belt, but I'm worried I might bore him or make it awkward.

I've got a job lined for me up in my field. I have my own apartment. Everything seems fine, right? It's not. 

I've realized I was gay since age 18 (came out at 19) but since then, I haven't changed much and in some ways i've gotten worse. I only kind of came out to my mom (I asked her if I had a boyfriend what would happen and she said she wouldn't care) and my dad doesn't know it all. Every day my dad calls me asking about girls and my life and it's just so hard to keep lying but I'm just way too scared to tell him. Even barely telling my mother took me 3 years. 

I'm still kind of ashamed of being gay even though my friends are totally accepting of me. I openly sleep with guys and comment on their hotness and stuff and they don't care. It's fine. So why do I still feel so fucking different from them? And lonely? Sometimes I fear that their acceptance of my sexuality will change  once we're older and they have families. It doesn't make sense, I know. 

I'm still not out at work and I still try to avoid people finding out i'm gay as much as possible. It's like I have two lives, one where i'm out and gay and another where i'm just faking and pretending. When i'm with my family I feel like a stranger, an intruder but that's all I know how to be. I love my family but they think I don't love them but I don't know how to be there. Ever since realizing I was gay it's just so much fucking distance that sometimes I just cry about it. But I don't fix it. 

I'm about to start my life but i'm still having these problems? It's been three years, why aren't I different?

I'm hoping that you guys can give me some insight here as well...

Here's the story, sorry in advance if it's long. 
I'll put a TLDR at the bottom. 

I'm dating a wonderful guy, we've been together a few months. He goes out of his way to make me happy, and I do the same for him. He knows that I'm not into bottoming, never have been. I bottomed occasionally in my past relationship but I've never been a fan (like even remotely). 

He is not really into bottoming either, but more flexible than I have been. He is certainly not cockhungry, but willing to take it occasionally for me, but often it ends up in handjobs and blowjobs if it hurts him or the mood isn't striking. 

We're both getting sick of not being able to fuck, and he said today that wants to take turns. I'm totally into the idea (I'll do it for him, he does plenty for me and I'm happy to do it), but I'm having trouble with execution. I know how important foreplay is to reduce pain, however I'm more wondering how to approach this from my end. 

How can I make this process easier on myself so that I can find some enjoyment? What should I be doing on my own time? Is there any way to get my mindset a little better? Anything is appreciated and hopefully I get some input that I can pass his way too. 

Thanks dudes, much love. 

TLDR: I'm a total top, boyfriend doesn't really like bottoming most of the time. We're trying to compromise and switch off. I need tips on how to prepare myself and how to make it more enjoyable for me.

He seemed to like me a lot too and would express it very well. Would text me regularly and call me handsome, he would always ask when I was free next so we could arrange our next date, would text me after each date to tell me how he had a good time.

Now this all changed out of nowhere one day and I just made it even worse. So we make plans to see eachother on a weekend , I don't hear from him for a few days so I reach out to him to know what's the plan for the weekend. He tells me he has to work, so I suggest we see eachother at night, he says he made plans to see a friend at night. So I suggest for another night and he says yes. He ends up cancelling last minute and I got a bit  upset , accused him of not being interested etc. and we argued for a bit by text :/ he said it was way too early for me to be reacting this way, which I agree, and we reconciled and set up another date, which went super well. But he didnt text me after to tell me he enjoyed it, although we got more intimate than we ever did,  he doesn't really text me anymore,  he's very dry in his texting, he doesn't compliment me. However he agreed to another date that I suggested.

Now I know that it's pretty obvious that this dude lost interest. But I'm wondering if there's a way I could relight his flame, anyway to ask him if he's still interested in pursuing this without seeming too clingy? Has anyone been in this situation or my guy's situation? Was a guy who seemed needy at an early stage able to win you back and how?

But he didnt text me after to tell me he enjoyed it, although we got more intimate than we ever did,  he doesn&amp;#39;t really text me anymore,  he&amp;#39;s very dry in his texting, he doesn&amp;#39;t compliment me. However he agreed to another date that I suggested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I know that it&amp;#39;s pretty obvious that this dude lost interest. But I&amp;#39;m wondering if there&amp;#39;s a way I could relight his flame, anyway to ask him if he&amp;#39;s still interested in pursuing this without seeming too clingy? Has anyone been in this situation or my guy&amp;#39;s situation? Was a guy who seemed needy at an early stage able to win you back and how? I&amp;#39;m really not that needy, I was just excited to see him and was disappointed when he kept cancelling, plus I had gotten into a fight with a good friend that day, so I was already in a shitty mood . Didn&amp;#39;t know what to think or do!&lt;/p&gt;

To start, idk if anyone has felt like this, but I've just been feeling like I'm stuck in a small pocket of air deep underwater and I'll never get to the surface. This feeling has slowly surfaced since I've moved back in with my mother a year ago (I'm 22).

 I moved back because of financial struggles, and she works in the school district meaning no pay for her in the summer. We talked and agreed to make things work and it would allow us to be able to finally save more money individually. So here I am now with the feeling I told you. Over this year things have just gradually gone downhill for me. 

I only have one real friend and we only get to hang out like once every other week because of conflicting schedules. All of my other friends just slowly disappeared after I came out. Adding to my shitty social life, things at home aren't any better. 

I haven't come out to my mother, although I'm sure she knows. She says that she would be supportive regardless, but she always wants to give me the ""religious sins"" talk, being the main reason why I haven't come out to her. On top of this we pretty much argue about petty things every other day. 

It got even worse. Back in November, just before Thanksgiving, I ended up getting arrested for AWDW against a peace officer (BS charges, a whole different story). I still have pending court cases for this, and the 5 days in jail resulted in me being unemployed now. 

So now arguments are like everyday. I try not to, but if I walk away, ""I'm running away from my problems,"" ""I'm just like my father"" usual bs. Coming to the climax of this story, Were about to submit a 30 day notice cause of having a slumlord, and I'm just not sure if I want to continue this. 

I'm just not happy anymore. So unhappy that I just come home and go to sleep. I've lost all inspiration in my music. These negative feelings have been so strong from all of the bs that I just don't have the energy to do much of anything lately. I've even contemplated suicide, only thing that stopped me was hurting the select few people that actually care about me.

I'm sure you've seen numerous posts about Grindr etc but I wanted to share this since it may have become a little bit of an issue for me recently.

This year I've pretty much been addicted to Grindr, as well as another site where I can hookup with guys. I have met a few already and all have been good experiences on the whole. Now let me say this - younger guys are a fucking nightmare. Most seem to be 'Gym bods looking for the same' etc, that or they're not ready to meet and want persuasion which I can't give. I've even been told that I'm too old at being 24 once! The dilemma I'm in is that I prefer younger guys, but it can be such a minefield to try and chat and hookup with them that I've ended up hooking up with older guys 6/7 times and it's been so much easier. They've all been laid back and just enjoyed it. 

I do prefer guys around my age or younger, and I usually see my age range as 20-30. Saturday night however I got pissed off by TWO dudes I tried to chat to that were younger than me so I ended up hooking up with a dude in his late 30's. Whilst I couldn't get it up at first it sorted itself out in the end and it was ok! He looked good for his age too !

I guess I am expanding my age range but it's pretty much due to the irritation of anyone 24 or younger that I've come across!

Since starting college (currently on my 4th semester) I've had at least one class each semester with this one guy.  I always found him attractive but we never talked much (mostly only talked through a mutual friend).  But then last semester we ended up having two classes together (by coincidence) and started spending a lot of time together.  It was during this time I started to develop feelings for him, even though I knew he was straight.  A few weeks ago I admitted to him how I really felt about him, thinking it would help me get over it (it helped with the last straight crush I had; physically hearing him tell me he wasn't interested helped knock sense into me).  He was great about it, saying he wasn't interested, but also that it wouldn't change anything, yet I'm still not over him.  

I know a common way to get over a crush is to just force yourself to stop thinking about them and resist the urge to text them 24/7, but that's not possible for me.  Not because I refuse to, but because it's physically not possible, or at the very least will be really difficult.  Of the 5 classes we are each taking this semester, we have 4 of them together, 3 of which we sit right next to each other and 1 he sits right behind me.  And in between classes we hang out with the same people, so we're together basically all day, and if my parents can't pick me up from school, he's the one who drives me home.  Outside of school we text each other almost everyday, but most of the time he's the one who texts me first.

I know nothing will ever happen between us, but it's hard to get over a crush when you physically can't avoid the person.  Any advice on other ways to get over someone?  I hope to continue being friends with him (we both admitted that we each consider the other to be the closest friend we've made since starting college), but I would like to do so without the painful one way romantic feelings.

I met a nice, very good looking guy on this app called Hinge.  We agreed to meet up at a bar for drinks after I got out of work and he got out of his law school classes.  I was really nervous leading up to the date.  Note that this bar is coincidentally a gay bar that we both agreed on, because it has great happy hour specials.

Anyway, we get there, and it doesn't start off the best, in my opinion.  I was standing at the bar, and I see him walk in and look around for me.  I waved and called his name, and he looked at me really confused for a second, made a pretty subtle surprised face, but then walked over and shook my hand.  I could tell he wasn't impressed by the way I looked, as much as he tried to hide it.  We ordered drinks,  sat down at a table, and started talking.  Like I said, I was really nervous and couldn't really think of what to say, especially since I was caught off guard by his reaction when we first met.  I was really intimidated and it felt like he was doing 75% of the talking, and I was doing only 25%.

This continues over about a half hour when this girl walks up to us.  She explained that she was really sorry, but she was supposed to meet her brother here, and he was running late.  She felt really awkward sitting by herself at a gay bar, so she asked if she could join us until he got there.  He said, ""Yeah, that's cool, as long as it's fine with you!"" and looked at me, so I nodded and said, ""Sure.""  I was actually relieved she came, because it took some pressure off me and a three-way conversation was much easier for me to handle.  We didn't mention that we were on a date though.  I think she just assumed we were friends.

We chat for another twenty minutes and another round of drinks when the brother walks in.  He's just as cute as my date.  (For reference, I'm 5'8"", dark hair, pretty skinny.  My date and her brother were both above 6'0"", very attractive, light brown/blonde hair, and much more toned than I am.)  He introduces himself and sits down next to my date.  He quickly joins in to the conversation, and it turns out he and my date have a lot in common.  I literally felt invisible for a minute when they started talking about some show I didn't know (Archer, I think?), and he made my date laugh more times than I did the entire night in like five minutes.  At one point, his sister whispered to me, ""I think my brother likes your friend!""  And I said, ""Actually, we're here on a date.""  

She apologized immediately and was like, ""Oh, why didn't you say so!  I never would have bothered you guys!  I'm sorry, c'mon, let's leave them to their date!""  And the brother goes, ""Date?"" and gives my date a bewildered look.  They say goodbyes (note: the brother completely ignores me the entire time) and leave us alone.  The conversation immediately goes from animated to dull in a second flat.  We go back and forth struggling to find things to talk about for a little.

Meanwhile, the brother and sister are at the next table, and it's so apparent how much my date and the brother want to talk to each other.  Like, I think my date thought he was being coy, or maybe this was even unintentional, but he kept looking quickly over at the brother for a split second.  I almost felt bad for keeping them away from each other.

Eventually, I figured this was going nowhere, and I wanted to seem like this was a mutual disinterest instead of me being the one to blow it, so I said, ""Maybe you should go talk to that guy.  I think you and him were clicking more than you and I are.""  And my date said, ""I'm here with you, no way am I just gonna ditch you for another dude.""  But I insisted, and said, ""No, I think you should do it. You guys were really hitting it off, and he's hot.""  My date agreed, and after some more coaxing from me, he decided to go at least get his number.  I said I had to leave anyway, and he thanked me for meeting him and said to keep in touch, and that we should totally hang out again - as friends.

That was Tuesday.  I've been thinking about it all week.  I felt good about it initially - I was able to read between the lines and agreed to be a nice, understanding guy.  Perhaps even a bit of a wingman!  But I'm starting to feel awful about it, like I'm a total quitter.  I feel like I gave up without a fight as soon as this better guy than me came into the picture.  I also feel useless.  Like a guy can win over this person in five minutes more than I could in almost an hour.  I feel ugly, and worthless, and stupid.  

My curiosity got the best of me this morning, so I texted my date to see what was up.  I asked what happened with the guy, and he said he went out with him that night, last night, and are meeting again tonight.  That could've been me!  It probably wouldn't have, but I definitely enabled it anyway.  I just feel so useless and pathetic.

Am I crazy for feeling this way?  Did I act appropriately?  Should I have done something different?

I literally felt invisible for a minute when they started talking about some show I didn&amp;#39;t know (Archer, I think?), and he made my date laugh more times than I did the entire night in like five minutes.  At one point, his sister whispered to me, &amp;quot;I think my brother likes your friend!&amp;quot;  And I said, &amp;quot;Actually, we&amp;#39;re here on a date.&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She apologized immediately and was like, &amp;quot;Oh, why didn&amp;#39;t you say so!  I never would have bothered you guys!  I&amp;#39;m sorry, c&amp;#39;mon, let&amp;#39;s leave them to their date!&amp;quot;  And the brother goes, &amp;quot;Date?&amp;quot; and gives my date a bewildered look.  They say goodbyes (note: the brother completely ignores me the entire time) and leave us alone.  The conversation immediately goes from animated to dull in a second flat.  We go back and forth struggling to find things to talk about for a little.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the brother and sister are at the next table, and it&amp;#39;s so apparent how much my date and the brother want to talk to each other.  Like, I think my date thought he was being coy, or maybe this was even unintentional, but he kept looking quickly over at the brother for a split second.  I almost felt bad for keeping them away from each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I figured this was going nowhere, and I wanted to seem like this was a mutual disinterest instead of me being the one to blow it, so I said, &amp;quot;Maybe you should go talk to that guy.  I think you and him were clicking more than you and I are.&amp;quot;  And my date said, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m here with you, no way am I just gonna ditch you for another dude.&amp;quot;  But I insisted, and said, &amp;quot;No, I think you should do it. You guys were really hitting it off, and he&amp;#39;s hot.&amp;quot;  My date agreed, and after some more coaxing from me, he decided to go at least get his number.  I said I had to leave anyway, and he thanked me for meeting him and said to keep in touch, and that we should totally hang out again - as friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was Tuesday.  I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about it all week.  I felt good about it initially - I was able to read between the lines and agreed to be a nice, understanding guy.  Perhaps even a bit of a wingman!  But I&amp;#39;m starting to feel awful about it, like I&amp;#39;m a total quitter.  I feel like I gave up without a fight as soon as this better guy than me came into the picture.  I also feel useless.  Like a guy can win over this person in five minutes more than I could in almost an hour.  I feel ugly, and worthless, and stupid.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My curiosity got the best of me this morning, so I texted my date to see what was up.  I asked what happened with the guy, and he said he went out with him that night, last night, and are meeting again tonight.  That could&amp;#39;ve been me!  It probably wouldn&amp;#39;t have, but I definitely enabled it anyway.  I just feel so useless and pathetic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am I crazy for feeling this way?  Did I act appropriately?  Should I have done something different?  Some advice or peace of mind would be great!&lt;/p&gt;

I (25) recently (about 7 months ago) got out of a two-year relationship with a really, really great guy (26). We had begun to fizzle and while I blame myself for most of it, the simple reality is that we just had a lot of growing up to do before we could really progress as a couple. Our communication had always been perhaps the strongest aspect of our relationship, and as a result we had a number of good - if not very difficult - talks about what we wanted and needed. 

We're both seeing a therapist to help resolve some of those issues. One of things we were advised to do was impose a separation on ourselves, to cease all forms of communication and involvement in each other's lives. Logically, the idea is what we gain some independence back to enable us to become better people. However, we're nearly two months in and I'm struggling mightily with it.

I'm trying to give it time to really sink in, in the hopes that what I'm feeling is just a lingering desire to return to the comfort and familiarity of a mostly-functional relationship. I know that's not the best option. Even more of an issue is my apparent inability to really establish myself individually. My ex and I have a LOT of mutual friends, and maintaining those friendships while not interacting with one another has proven difficult and at times unfulfilling. I've attempted to make new friends, and have succeeded in a number of those attempts, but I'm finding myself unable to really connect with people. I've lost interest in my hobbies, and more than ever before feel isolated from my own life. I'm gaining weight, sleeping poorly, pretty much just going through the motions of a life that isn't satisfying to me at the moment. 

I do the usual things people seem to do in order to break out of a rut: I go out and do things I might not normally do, while indulging in some of my better habits to ""reward"" myself. I've made an effort to pick up new hobbies, or find new creative outlets for myself. I make impulsive, harmless decisions to alleviate the foreboding sense of monotony that plagues me. Nothing really seems to ignite a fire in me at all.

Therapy is helping, a little, but I'm using that as a method to address some of my deeper issues (like gay shame, something my intolerant conservative family instilled in me). Has anyone gone through something similar? What helped you find a sense of belonging during the lengthy healing process?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I (25) recently (about 7 months ago) got out of a two-year relationship with a really, really great guy (26).

Talked to a 17-year-old boy on Grindr two weeks ago, and I decided to meet up with him at his school. Since we're both 17, I figured nothing absolutely terrible could happen, right? Yeah, notice my username. 

I met him at his school, and since he lives on his own with his flatmate near town, we walked together to his flat. It was the first time I had met anyone and I was a bit nervous and stuff. I asked him questions because he was extremely shy, and he never asked me anything back, which I found a bit boring. 

Anyway, he invited me into his flat. And while we were in his flat, we sat shoulder to shoulder on a tiny sofa while he stroked his cat. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary, really. I mean, besides the fact he was wearing long, black sharp fingernails ONLY on his right hand but I assumed he liked that and wouldn't really judge. He was cute. 

We were watching TV and petting his adorable cat. And after I asked him more questions while we watched the Simpsons, it got very, very silent. I mean, that had happened many times before, and I wasn't surprised. But then out of nowhere something terrifying happened.

He said 'I'm paranoid.' and my only reaction was to ask 'What? What do you mean?' to which he replied, 'I just am.'
That made me a bit uncomfortable. Then, I looked at his hands and noticed something that scared the shit out of me. He was playing with a camping knife in his hand while saying all those things to me. Who the fuck does that? And I thought immediately of all the things /r/askgaybros had said about warning signs, and I stood up (My legs were shaking BADLY) and told him I had to leave and get back to school (This was during a two hour long recess) within 5 seconds after seeing the knife. I stood up, grabbed my bag and walked towards the door. I had trouble talking and putting on my shoes because I kept shaking like a chihuahua dog. And I saw him put the camping knife back into his pocket.

When I stepped out of his flat and looked at him, I said just for the sake of being polite 'It was nice meeting you'. He laughed and said 'Even if we didn't do much' and I stepped into the lift and breathed as I realised I had gotten out of there alive. I was terrified. I was scared out of my bloody mind! 

As soon as I was out and completely alone, I texted my friend and let them know I would be at school very soon to tell them exactly what had happened. At school, 99 % of my friends said it was good that I left. But 1 % of my friends said I should have stayed because he probably didn't mean to do anything.

Now, I can't stop wondering whether what I did was wrong? Should I have stayed? Was it wrong of me to LEAVE when I saw him playing with the knife? I was just terrified he'd stab me right there and then, leaving me to die in his flat while no one knew where I was. I'm young, and I don't want to die.

I'm from Sweden, so I apologise if none of this made any sense and my English sucks.

&lt;p&gt;Talked to a 17-year-old boy on Grindr two weeks ago, and I decided to meet up with him at his school. Since we&amp;#39;re both 17, I figured nothing absolutely terrible could happen, right? Yeah, notice my username. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I met him at his school, and since he lives on his own with his flatmate near town, we walked together to his flat. It was the first time I had met anyone and I was a bit nervous and stuff. I asked him questions because he was extremely shy, and he never asked me anything back, which I found a bit boring. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, he invited me into his flat. And while we were in his flat, we sat shoulder to shoulder on a tiny sofa while he stroked his cat. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary, really. I mean, besides the fact he was wearing long, black sharp fingernails ONLY on his right hand but I assumed he liked that and wouldn&amp;#39;t really judge. He was cute. &lt;/p&gt;
