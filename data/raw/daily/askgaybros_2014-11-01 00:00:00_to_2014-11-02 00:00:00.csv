I can&amp;#39;t fathom the concept of a boyfriend, and seeing two dudes kissing is jarring enough for me to jump away. No offense. And I do mean -romantic- relationships as the priority here. I mean really want 2.5 kids and dog kinda family life ect ect, but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean I haven&amp;#39;t explored homosexual sex,(I&amp;#39;m a firm believer that you should go discover what gets you off and enjoy it) and with the proper boundaries set I can love it immensely. Bout the same enjoyment of sticking myself into a nice lady. Perhaps I&amp;#39;m just explaining the most obvious case of confused male coming to terms with bisexuality. It&amp;#39;s confusing and I&amp;#39;m always worried what my dad would say if he saw my porn history. He&amp;#39;s not the nicest to gays. If its just plain and simple bisexuality i want some online strangers to smack my back and tell me its okay. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR Confused dude who likes dudes, but in physical sense only and not much more than women. what does that make me?&lt;/p&gt;
