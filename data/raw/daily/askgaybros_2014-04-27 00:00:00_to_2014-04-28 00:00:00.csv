Looking for advice but also just looking to rant a little bit.

So basically a few months ago I met this really cool guy, and I'm going to call him D for simplicity's sake, and we really hit it off. Unfortunately D had to go back to college, and we were pretty far apart for a while. We kept in contact and talked essentially everyday. The types of conversations we had were essentially conversations that a couple would have. We'd call each other babe (and our own personal variation of it), talk about how much we cared for each other, and got to know each other really well. It got to the point where we were planning to meet up at some point.  Me, being the brilliant person that I am, decided it'd be amazing to spend an entire summer getting a job where he's going to be headed to grad school next year. At the time, it seemed like a foolproof plan. D was a second semester senior, he was very interested in me, and we were talking every day. I wasn't expecting anything to go wrong, because I was completely insane and convinced myself it would all work out beautifully. We'd spend the entire summer together, it'd be awesome, then maybe a potential long term relationship, blah blah blah. So I got the job about 3 months ago, and D seemed to be just as excited as I was about it. We started talking about when his lease would start and when we'd hang out and everything. 

Then, as of about a month and a half ago, shit went downhill pretty quickly for me. I was texting him, and didn't get a response for a few days, which was weird. I gave him some space because I knew he was busy doing research and trying to get grants and stuff, but after a couple days I decided to double text and see what was up. I said a basic ""hey, beautiful :)"" and eventually, that day got a response. Basically, D got a new boyfriend, and he was incredibly cold about it too. Basically, ignored me for a while, and then asked to talk about it. When we ""talked"", he spent the entire time justifying his actions and repeatedly saying he did nothing wrong. That's technically correct, but it sucked being told that I was technically nothing to him. Whatever, I told D that I needed some time away from him and maybe I'd see him this summer, because now I have a job at his school that I can't exactly back out of.

A few days after that, D sends me a text apologizing for the way he acted. He says he talked to his friends back home, who he told all about me back when we were still talking excessively, and they all told him he was an asshole for the way that he acted. I appreciated the apology, but wasn't ready to talk to him again.

As of a few days ago, I decided I wanted to see how he was doing. I called him up and he said he was busy, but he texted me telling him when I was free over the next couple days and we could talk. I texted him twice, and didn't get a response either time. I'm at the point where I realize that this is so dead and chances are it's never gonna come back, but I just feel like there are things I want to say that I'm never gonna be able to say. I feel like I lost something that could have been amazing without even getting a fighting chance, and that really bothers me more than it should. I'm not a stupid person by any means, but I'm acting stupid about this entire situation. Hell, I planned my entire summer around someone who may or may not have ever cared about me, if that's not stupid, I don't know what is. I guess I'm also just beating myself up because I know I made a huge mistake.

In addition to this, I kind of just feel helpless about this summer. Originally, D was going to introduce me to his entire friend group, who he claimed were all incredibly excited to meet me. Now, I'm completely alone. I literally know nobody out there, and my job isn't exactly in a good environment for me to make friends (I'm 19, and I'm working in a research lab with people who are mostly 40+. I don't believe there are any other undergrads in the lab with me this summer). I also have to spend my entire summer studying for the MCATs and staying in good shape, because I'm a D1 athlete. Also, since I'm 19, bars and clubs aren't exactly an option at the moment. Any advice on that?

I also just have no desire to be at D's grad school this summer. This school, actually, is my very top choice med school. It's a fantastic opportunity for my future career, and I can make valuable connections that would definitely help me out in the admissions process. But I'm honestly just dreading getting on that plane and going somewhere where I have nobody and nothing. I don't have any fall back options though, and I already signed a contract for housing, so I honestly can't back out of it now. I convinced a few friends to fly out and see me over the summer, but that'll be about a week out of 2.5 lonely months. 

Sorry for the convoluted-ness, but what I'm looking for is this: How do you deal with the feelings of feeling like there's things that were left unsaid? How should I approach dealing with being alone for 2.5 months in an environment that isn't ideal for making friends? How can I stop beating myself up for stupid decisions that I made months ago? How can I deal with these feelings of inadequacy because this guy that seemed to care about me suddenly dropped me and never looked back? My self esteem has taken a huge toll, my athletic performance has tanked to the point where my position on my team is compromised, my grades are going downhill, and I'm letting this get to me far more than it should. How do I pick myself up from something that shouldn't affect me this much, and move the fuck on? And lastly, why the fuck do I still care about this guy so much?

Anyway, I'm a very private introvert (with social anxiety) and I went over to his house yesterday to play games. He invited a few other people without me knowing, so I was already kind of uncomfortable, but whatever - that's good for me.

Contact was pretty mutual, but we never really hung out in person too often due to our age difference (me being a few years older).  Always snapchatting me selfies and usually being the only one to always respond to my snapchat stories.  Randomly texting about random things.  He made me feel good about myself, and I was developing feelings down the road.  Problem was (and usually the case in general) is that he's to my knowledge straight.  

I have drunk texted him in the past a few times. During those instances, he would either ignore me or find it funny. I even sent a  :heart: symbol a couple of those times and he would say stuff like ""funny' or ""you wish."" He doesn't really drink much so he wouldn't be one to reciprocate in that manner.   

Then this was when I fucked it up...a few weeks ago, I was out with friends and got drunk again. I texted him and he told me he couldn't talk. I said to him ""ok ;) &lt;3,"" then he texted back right away saying ""stop."" 

The next day I apologized for pissing him off; all he said was ""lol we're cool"" and changed the subject. I've gotten the message now that I can no longer try to pursue him; I figured if he was remotely interested in me, let alone guys, he would've tried to flirt with me back. I feel like crap for putting the friendship in jeopardy, but I need to get over him. I'm afraid if I come out to him anytime soon, he'll put two and two together and it may be more awkward...but this is not where it ends...

He doesn't initiate texting with me as much as he used to, nor does he reply (as much) to my snapchats or initiate sending snaps.  When I suggest hanging out, he started to blow me off usually instead of instantly willing to join me, but whenever we're together in person otherwise (have a couple of mutual acquaintances), he's still very friendly with me and tries to talk to me.  

Now I know you don't know the guy, but my question is what could be going through his mind.  Do you think he may already know I'm into guys and is trying to keep his distance?

We're both students doing the same degree, but at different universities which are about an hour away from each other. We met at a national student body type week-long meet-up thing. (I'm trying to be vague so excuse me).

Anyway point being, we hit it off straight away, became good friends quickly, had a couple of heart to heart chats, and it was all really nice. Plus he's fairly hot. So on the last night of this national student body type week-long meet-up thing, in our final heart to heart chat, I decided I would come out to him. We got talking about the whole gay thing and how long did you know and all this, and what he said to me was that he's felt attractions to men in the past and understands it, and he's had girlfriends but nothing serious and not for a while, he's just a bit ehh about it right now.

I really like this guy, and he really likes me. We've talked about meeting up and since we went back home to our respective universities, we've continued to text each other every day and he's given me advice on stuff. He even briefly suggested I should transfer to his university to do the rest of the degree there. I've been thinking about what he said on the final night and I don't know if maybe I could've pressed that and delved into the idea more. We've only know each other for two weeks now, so I don't think it would be weird like it might be with a longer term friend. He might just say no altogether. I'm not sure!! What should I do? He's a lovely lovely guy so I want him to stay in my life, but I am attracted to him. It wouldn't even have to be a serious thing, more like experimenting with each other. I personally never got to do that because in my teenage years that opportunity never presented itself, and I'm still not fully out to everybody. I can't speak for him, but maybe he's still in that phase where perhaps he's temped to try it out. After all, some guys don't fully connect with the idea they might be gay/bi/whatever until their early 20s or later.

What can I do to initiate that while still preserving the prospects of a good friendship if he says no to it? Should I even be considering this?

Thanks for your help","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, I&amp;#39;m 18, and I met this guy, 19, last week. We&amp;#39;re both students doing the same degree, but at different universities which are about an hour away from each other. We met at a national student body type week-long meet-up thing. (I&amp;#39;m trying to be vague so excuse me).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway point being, we hit it off straight away, became good friends quickly, had a couple of heart to heart chats, and it was all really nice. Plus he&amp;#39;s fairly hot. So on the last night of this national student body type week-long meet-up thing, in our final heart to heart chat, I decided I would come out to him. We got talking about the whole gay thing and how long did you know and all this, and what he said to me was that he&amp;#39;s felt attractions to men in the past and understands it, and he&amp;#39;s had girlfriends but nothing serious and not for a while, he&amp;#39;s just a bit ehh about it right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really like this guy, and he really likes me. We&amp;#39;ve talked about meeting up and since we went back home to our respective universities, we&amp;#39;ve continued to text each other every day and he&amp;#39;s given me advice on stuff. He even briefly suggested I should transfer to his university to do the rest of the degree there. I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about what he said on the final night and I don&amp;#39;t know if maybe I could&amp;#39;ve pressed that and delved into the idea more. We&amp;#39;ve only know each other for two weeks now, so I don&amp;#39;t think it would be weird like it might be with a longer term friend. He might just say no altogether. I&amp;#39;m not sure!! What should I do? He&amp;#39;s a lovely lovely guy so I want him to stay in my life, but I am attracted to him. It wouldn&amp;#39;t even have to be a serious thing, more like experimenting with each other. I personally never got to do that because in my teenage years that opportunity never presented itself, and I&amp;#39;m still not fully out to everybody. I can&amp;#39;t speak for him, but maybe he&amp;#39;s still in that phase where perhaps he&amp;#39;s temped to try it out.

I was going to make a throwaway, but fuck it I don't care. It's more of a vent, and not just about gay issues, but I have no one else to talk these things through. Any advice or perspective would be really appreciated as well though! I'll try not to make it too long.  

To start with, I've known I was gay since I was 13 or so - never really had an issue acknowledging it myself. I was open about it among close friends at school, so never really had a problem back then until we went our separate ways for college/university. I'm out to some of the friends I've had since, but have never felt able to tell my family or anyone who might come in contact with them, and as a result never been able to act on my sexuality or pursue relationships. I don't really want to go into details, but my mom can have a pretty tainted view towards gay people and relationships, and while it seems to have softened over the past couple of years it still seems rather unsafe to tell her while she's providing a roof over my head.  

While I'm sure this reads pretty standard so far, there are other factors that feel like they're preventing me from taking action and moving on with my life. I've been stuck at home since moving back from university, and can't earn anywhere near enough to move out and into my own place. My degree has only allowed me to do the odd bit of freelance work where it's available, and I make a tiny bit extra doing a few hours of minimum wage retail work each week - anything that resembles an actual career that I'm actually qualified for is out of reach at the moment as I lack the experience to get into even an entry-level position.  

I've been in this limbo for nearly 2 years now, and I'm usually able to just cast aside my worries, but it's hit me like a brick suddenly what a lonely existence I have now. I'm approaching 25 and have never had a proper relationship, I have no local friends and the one friend I do keep in touch with regularly never wants to discuss anybody's problems. Where I live doesn't have any LGBT groups, and even if it did I wouldn't be able to get out of the house without raising suspicion. I've debated trying dating sites or apps, but it raises similar obstacles, plus my self-esteem's not great at the moment (no shit, huh?).  

I've always reassured myself with the mantra of ""it gets better"", but it really doesn't feel like it. As I said before, I can usually keep a lid on it, but this suffocating situation is starting to break me. I always thought it was sad and desperate for people to revolve around relationships, but it's hit me how lonely I am and would like to have a companion myself. It's so frustrating that my life feels like it's been put on hold for so long, and that getting my own place will probably allow me to explore dating and relationships. It's just out of my reach at the moment, you know?  

Sorry to sound really depressing, and don't worry I'm not in *that* dark a place. I just really needed to get that off my chest, and wondered if anyone has been in a similar boat and how they get around it.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey all, I&amp;#39;ve been lurking here for a while and wanted to make this post for a while, but I&amp;#39;m always conscious of it sounding like some pity party.

I don't want to write a novel either so I'll keep it as short as possible. Basically, I've always liked girls etc (never been in a relationship though), but lately noticed that I might like guys and was curious. So, I downloaded Grindr and talked to a few cool people. I hit it off with this one guy and as scared as I was we decided to meet up. We went to Starbucks and talked for almost 3 hours until they closed! It was amazing. (I was honest and let him know I was new to this and never met up with a guy before and wasnt too sure about myself he completely understood). 

We then hung out 2 more days in a row and then the next week we had an amazing day long adventure. After, we went back to his house, we laid in bed and talked.. and that's when I kissed a guy for the first time. We then cuddled and went to sleep :). 

Ever since then we have been seeing each other around 2x a week since (its been 2 months) and have so much fun together. I never thought I'd actually meet up with a guy but I'm so happy I did. He is really amazing and this is all obviously very new to me. The only thing ive been struggling with is well.. what am I? Im always excited to see him/get a text from him and we have so much in common. We've done so many fun things together, etc. I love being with him. He's been so patient with me and we've done HJ's and BJ's and even showered together heh :P. (Haven't gone all the way though!)

I really like him, but I also feel really confused sometimes, maybe even second guessing myself.
