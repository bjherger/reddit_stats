He has an open relationship with a mutual bisexual female friend. 

He refers to her as his girlfriend (in just about every conversation) although she doesn't see them as having a relationship, just as friends with benefits. She's also told me she thinks he may be bi and in love with me [see previous post] (http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/244qdy/best_friends_girlfriend_told_me_hes_gay/)

My friend has always been very affectionate when drunk (resting head on my lap, hugging me from behind, tickling me) but lately, when he's been drinking, he blurs the lines between affection and sensual (trying to kiss my neck, lick my ear, once slipping his hand under my shirt to feel my abs.) It's a turn-on but confusing, especially as he conveniently forgets all about it the next day.

He's a close friend. I like him, I'm very attracted to him and if he was openly gay or bi, I would consider him boyfriend material. But I'm not willing to risk our friendship and sell myself short by being his drunk experiment (followed not doubt by convenient morning-after amnesia &amp; awkwardness.)

I don't know if he's trying to reach out to me with these drunk gestures and I should be more receptive? Or if I should set boundaries instead?

Any advice/insight would be welcome.

He did come over but it was only 4 hours this time because he had to go with his father somewhere.

Since then we've had to reschedule the 3rd date 4 times. The first time was my fault - work related. The second time his dad was busy so he couldn't drop him off at my house. The third time he had forgot about the date all together - I was pissed. I told him that I was mad he had forgotten about me but we ended up talking it out and I forgave him. He was supposed to be over yesterday as our 4th attempt but he says he got food poisoning (which he was complaining about an upset stomach on the phone on saturday night). I got frustrated and pretty much didn't tell him to get better or anything, just that I was upset he wasn't going to be here. He hasn't responded to any of my texts since noon yesterday - but he's been updating social media.

Every day I think about making a post like this, or talking to someone about it. I fantasize about being able to talk openly with someone about how I feel. I spend a lot of my time just thinking about how much better life could be, I could be happy, have a job, do things, go outside.. talk to people

I haven't talked to another human being that isn't family in over a year. I am a complete shut in. I hate it, and I can't seem to make myself do anything to change it. I spend so much fucking time thinking about  changing things, but never actually turn thoughts into actions. Even making a fucking anonymous post about it has taken me months to get the courage to  do. I'm alone, I wish i had someone to talk to and hug and embrace and just be able to open myself up to. 

so far in life i have achieved absolutely nothing. I am a complete failure. When I was younger, I had a benign tumour in my jaw that caused me to miss some school. I got into a habit of not going to school, then that habit became me hiding under the covers while my parents shouted at me. I wasted my childhood playing mmos and sleeping. lots of just sleeping because it is easier to sleep than it is to think about things. My coping mechanism for anything became just to hide away from it, to hide under the covers. I haven't completed my leaving cert (equivalent of highschool GED or whatever it is in america), because I missed so much school and eventually just gave up entirely.

I went and did a years college course in a community college where I got some FETAC certs and was supposed to do my CompTIA A+ certs, but I never did those. at the end of the year I ended up failing to do two of the classes, because I procrastinated and ended up doing my coping mechanism of just fucking hiding away. I still can't get the courage to go back to that place because I am deathly afraid someone will recognize me and ask what happened.. I stopped keeping up contact with the one guy I met there that I finally had something in common with (games, reddit, just general geekyness.) I don't know if he just didn't like me or what, but he didn't try to keep up contact either.. I wish I could just ask him and know. I even have him added on steam, but I cringe at every time I see him online because i'm afraid he'll ask what i'm doing.

Here I am, almost a year after finishing the college course, and I have done absolutely nothing. I was doing well after college, even with the fuckups, because I was doing keto and losing weight - but then I fucked up somewhere and let myself slip, and now i'm back at the weight I was. 

My weight kills me. I can't go outside because I feel everyone is judging me. I wish I could feel like a normal person and just do normal things, without fearing that random people are judging me or that i might run into someone I know and have them ask what i'm up to. 

I want to have a relationship, I want a job, I want purpose in life. I can't keep waking up, sitting down on my chair and wasting the entire day on reddit/steam. 

I began learning python about 4 months ago in the hopes I could teach myself something useful while I waste away my life at home. I have so many unfinished projects, things I should finish but always end up wasting time on reddit or steam instead. I feel like I couldn't get a job in programming or with the skills I got from the college course, because I don't even know them well enough myself. 

everything fucking sucks. I want to be a person and not just a leech that lives at home. I want to be a fucking person.

I can't even cry anymore, i'm just so fucking drained it's like nothing can make me feel emotions.

I can't even imagine being in a relationship with anyone, because who would want to go near a fat fucking loner? I really wish I had someone to talk to and confide in. I need help

im sorry for the rambling bullshit, I need to just put this up somewhere.

&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t talked to another human being that isn&amp;#39;t family in over a year. I am a complete shut in. I hate it, and I can&amp;#39;t seem to make myself do anything to change it. I spend so much fucking time thinking about  changing things, but never actually turn thoughts into actions. Even making a fucking anonymous post about it has taken me months to get the courage to  do. I&amp;#39;m alone, I wish i had someone to talk to and hug and embrace and just be able to open myself up to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so far in life i have achieved absolutely nothing. I am a complete failure. When I was younger, I had a benign tumour in my jaw that caused me to miss some school. I got into a habit of not going to school, then that habit became me hiding under the covers while my parents shouted at me. I wasted my childhood playing mmos and sleeping. lots of just sleeping because it is easier to sleep than it is to think about things. My coping mechanism for anything became just to hide away from it, to hide under the covers. I haven&amp;#39;t completed my leaving cert (equivalent of highschool GED or whatever it is in america), because I missed so much school and eventually just gave up entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went and did a years college course in a community college where I got some FETAC certs and was supposed to do my CompTIA A+ certs, but I never did those. at the end of the year I ended up failing to do two of the classes, because I procrastinated and ended up doing my coping mechanism of just fucking hiding away. I still can&amp;#39;t get the courage to go back to that place because I am deathly afraid someone will recognize me and ask what happened.. I stopped keeping up contact with the one guy I met there that I finally had something in common with (games, reddit, just general geekyness.) I don&amp;#39;t know if he just didn&amp;#39;t like me or what, but he didn&amp;#39;t try to keep up contact either.. I wish I could just ask him and know. I even have him added on steam, but I cringe at every time I see him online because i&amp;#39;m afraid he&amp;#39;ll ask what i&amp;#39;m doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I am, almost a year after finishing the college course, and I have done absolutely nothing. I was doing well after college, even with the fuckups, because I was doing keto and losing weight - but then I fucked up somewhere and let myself slip, and now i&amp;#39;m back at the weight I was. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My weight kills me. I can&amp;#39;t go outside because I feel everyone is judging me. I wish I could feel like a normal person and just do normal things, without fearing that random people are judging me or that i might run into someone I know and have them ask what i&amp;#39;m up to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to have a relationship, I want a job, I want purpose in life. I can&amp;#39;t keep waking up, sitting down on my chair and wasting the entire day on reddit/steam. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I began learning python about 4 months ago in the hopes I could teach myself something useful while I waste away my life at home. I have so many unfinished projects, things I should finish but always end up wasting time on reddit or steam instead. I feel like I couldn&amp;#39;t get a job in programming or with the skills I got from the college course, because I don&amp;#39;t even know them well enough myself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;everything fucking sucks. I want to be a person and not just a leech that lives at home. I want to be a fucking person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t even cry anymore, i&amp;#39;m just so fucking drained it&amp;#39;s like nothing can make me feel emotions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t even imagine being in a relationship with anyone, because who would want to go near a fat fucking loner? I really wish I had someone to talk to and confide in. I need help&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;im sorry for the rambling bullshit, I need to just put this up somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
