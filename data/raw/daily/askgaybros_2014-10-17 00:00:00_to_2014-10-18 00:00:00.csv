 Let me explain. 

Most gay/bi guys seem to say they ""knew"" at 15, some earlier some later. Of those whose came out to themselves at a later age (myself being about 17) all seem to say they were just ignoring it or looking the other way but had at some point been attracted to the same sex. 

Even know I was somewhat late what I don't understand is that before 17 I don't have any recollection of boy crushes or any doubt about my sexuality at all. And then at late 16/17 I can't pinpoint it but I started to realise I was starting to focus less and less on the girls in porn and more on the guys. 

I accepted I was bi and still identify as so, but over time I've found myself getting less and less interested in women whereas before preference would sway. Before I'd rarely notice guys but now for a long while it's been the opposite. I can still ""get off"" to say a delightful lesbian porno but the idea of having a girlfriend and sex with the opposite gender becomes less and less an interest. I'm not a fan of this word but I've become less and less ""straight acting"" with this progression as well, not forcefully but I can see I just have. 

I don't want this to sound like I'm scared of being gay because I'm not and am totally comfortable going wherever my sexuality leads me but I was just interested to see if any others have had similar experiences.

I'm a pretty good person in real life.

So... I'm not out, don't plan on being out, probably never will be out. That being said, I'm a pretty good looking guy. Have never had any problems with the ladies (or dudes for that matter lol).

I met a dude almost 3 years ago online and we've sort of had a DL relationship since. He's in the same mindset like me - DL and masculine. He's good looking, but definitely not in the same league as me. He's always been there for me, and is overall just a good guy.

This was supposed to be just a random hookup, never would have expected it to turn into more. We quickly hit it off. It started off with me fucking him. We lived pretty far from each other, so we would meet once a week and I would fuck him 3 times or more the day when we would meet (I have a very, very, very high sex drive lol). This has always been my dream - to find another masculine DL guy who we could hang out in real life and nobody knows what happens behind closed doors.

After 6 months or so, I moved closer to him, so we were able to meet more often, workout with each other daily, etc.

Now I'm the type of dude who never thought I would take a dick in my ass. I never had the desire to, nor have I never used to like watching gay porn with fucking. After about a year of meeting, we went out clubbing (straight club, of course) and got super drunk, and I wound up letting him fuck me that night. And let me tell you this... I was pretty damm good for a beginner haha. We fucked for 2 hours in every position imagineable, from the bed, to the kitchen, to the bathroom, etc. I'm a pretty alpha dude, so I was basically controlling everything.

Damm... what was I missing my whole life! It was one of the best feelings ever. (For all you 100% tops out there - I definitely recommend trying it, you don't know what you're missing out on!) Anyways...

After that happened, I could never get that outta my mind. All I would think about was gay sex. Getting fucked, etc. Now I love watching gayporn with fucking.

Since we both have our separate lives, and also have other obligations, and even though we get to meet up daily for a couple hours to workout, we don't always get to fuck around. This lead to me testing the waters with other guys. I've met some pretty cool good looking dudes, but I've never been able to find anyone else who I was able to click with like my original guy.

FYI - We were supposed to be exclusive. I caught him messing around with other dudes also, and was super hurt, so I've always held a grudge against him for this and didn't feel one bit bad when I would do it.

Anyways he doesn't really share the same sex drive as me. I'm ALWAYS horny. So every chance I get, I'll go ahead and fuck around. I have a few regular dudes who I mess around with, so there's always somebody available.

I've expressed how I feel to him many times about always being horny and him not really being able to satisfy it since we don't mess around everyday. I've even thrown in the fact that I get it from other dudes (brutal I know, but since I hold that grudge, I don't really care to be honest lol). He gets pretty pissed about this since he wants to be exclusive and swears he's never messed around with any other dudes ever since I found out. We also fight pretty often since both of us are stubborn as hell, and always are competing to be the alpha dude, it puts a big strain on things. So it's pretty easy for me to go and mess around with somebody else.

I would really like to find somebody else who is better looking than him, that shares the same sex drive as me, but it's been super difficult. At the same time, I don't really wanna hurt this dude, and I'm gonna be honest - it's gonna be hard to let go. I've already talked to him about this, and he gets pretty pissed.

I'm not really looking for advice, since I've pretty much already let it be known to him my feelings and thoughts, and what I've been doing. He also WON'T let this happen. He'll show up everyday to my house to work this out - he doesn't care lol. So it's pretty impossible to completely stop things with him to be honest, no matter how much I talk to him.

I'm wondering if there are any dudes out there in the same boat as me that can relate. I'm interested to hear what you've done.

Anyways I'm gonna go jerk off or something haha, hopefully I get some good replies.

The issue is that I have no idea whether or not he reciprocates these feelings, and he is also in my fraternity (is gay though).  Our organization doesn&amp;#39;t really frown upon this, but it isn&amp;#39;t typical either, for our chapter.  That being said, I am a senior in college, and don&amp;#39;t face &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; consequences for talking to him about this.  Even though I&amp;#39;m about to leave the state for graduate school for a while, I&amp;#39;m terrified that expressing my feelings toward him will make things weird in the long run, and even moving (at the least) 800 miles away will create an irreparably awkward situation.  How should I approach this?  Yes, this is a possibly typical question for this sub but I&amp;#39;m in a place where I genuinely need advice about how to talk to/not talk to this guy.

Since I've met him, there have been periods where we have hung out a lot, but also periods where we didn't see much of each other at all; I was on vacation for four weeks, he was gone every weekend for a while. He's a great guy and I like him a lot, but I was never sure how serious we were. Although he reffered to me as his boyfriend, we had never discussed our relationship and he had never told me he missed me or really expressed his feelings to me.

Last week, I went to France to visit a friend. One day, she was Tindering on her coach and implored me to download the app as well. It was fun and I thought nothing of it. When matches answered me, we would answer back for entertainment.

When I left her place, I stayed in Paris for a night before my flight. I was bored and alone, so I decided to keep tindering for fun. Granted, I never had any intention of meeting up with anyone, but would talk to some people to pass the time. While I was doing this, I was literally talking to him at the same time.

When I got back to the US, he went through my phone (intentionally snooping) one morning and saw Tinder and all the messages. He didn't confront me about it until the next day, when he came over with a couple of my things and accused me of cheating on him and how hurt he was.

I calmly explained the situation to him explaining I had no intention of meeting up with anyone. I was simply bored and looking at eye candy halfway around the world. I didn't bother to hide the app on my phone because quite frankly, I didn't think it was a big deal; if he had asked, I would have definitely just showed it to him and gone through it with him.

I thought I had gotten through to him, but after a day he hastily called me and now, he wants to break up because he doesn't understand how I could think it was okay to do such a thing regardless of intention. I was honestly shocked how much he cared because although we started to spend more time together, I still felt he was kind of distant with me and we had never discussed our relationship at length.

I really like this guy and obviously have hurt him, even though I still don't think I did anything that was terrible. I want to show him that he is important to me and want to be with him, but I'm not sure what the best way to go about it is. Any help would be appreciated.

&lt;p&gt;I want to stop trying to make myself look like what a lot of men would say is hot. It&amp;#39;s ruining me, it&amp;#39;s taking over everything. Many men will say I am hot, that I&amp;#39;m smart and I&amp;#39;m intelligent, but it doesn&amp;#39;t reassure me. It feels like they&amp;#39;re lying to make me feel better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heck, I can&amp;#39;t even lose weight&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to be content with myself. &lt;/p&gt;

This is the first time I post here, I have come out of the closet to some friends about a month ago and now I want to get to know some other guys since I don't even have any gay friends. A friend of mine said that I should create a tinder so I can find some guys, but I don't know, I am quite insecure and I don't want to just have some hookups. Do you think I should create an account, or maybe an account in some other relationship site?
Thanks in advance. :)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey.
