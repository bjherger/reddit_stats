I've never really been in a relationship, and I've only gone on a handful of dates in my life. I went out with a guy twice, and both times I was invited to go back to his place after dinner/drinks (which I accepted). The first time we just continued chatting, but the second time he made a move and we made out for a bit. We chatted a bit more and I left soon afterwards.

I texted him the next day asking if he wanted to meet up again, but he responded saying he didn't feel a romantic connection.

Since 1) I'm the type to overanalyze everything and have a hard time getting over seemingly trivial things, and 2) I almost have 0 experience in things like this, what went wrong here? I think we had really good conversation for hours, so I don't think that was the problem. Was he expecting more than just kissing (I'm sure I was really awkward about it.), or was the lack of connection determined by just a kiss? Does being invited over to someone's place solely mean they want to have sex? I think I'm confused because I feel like going out on two dates isn't even enough to jump to any sort of conclusion (unless they're blatantly awful).

I know my naivety is really showing through with these questions and that this is a stupid thing to obsess over, but I'm not sure what to think or was going on in his head.

I never really closed the book with him. I fell hard, and I fell deep. This scared me bc of the age difference and differing ideas for a future. I just quit responding to him, which makes me feel terrible. I still think of him daily. 

In the meantime, I've been seeing someone else great for awhile now. He's sweet, thoughtful, caring, sex is great, same goals, etc. I can see myself with him in the long run, but I have reservations on some things. 

I want to meet with the first guy and tell him my thoughts and feelings but honestly I'm scared. I'm scared to fall for him again when things are going well with who I'm seeing now. I melt when I see him smile...

&lt;p&gt;I never really closed the book with him. I fell hard, and I fell deep. This scared me bc of the age difference and differing ideas for a future. I just quit responding to him, which makes me feel terrible. I still think of him daily. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I&amp;#39;ve been seeing someone else great for awhile now. He&amp;#39;s sweet, thoughtful, caring, sex is great, same goals, etc. I can see myself with him in the long run, but I have reservations on some things. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to meet with the first guy and tell him my thoughts and feelings but honestly I&amp;#39;m scared. I&amp;#39;m scared to fall for him again when things are going well with who I&amp;#39;m seeing now. I melt when I see him smile...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has anyone gone through something similar? Or can offer advice?&lt;/p&gt;

I've been working in this new retail job for almost 4 months now and there's a guy that I really like and he's new too. At first he didn't say a thing even though I smiled at him and said ""hi"" (I think he's shy and I'm kinda shy too) but since 2 weeks ago he greeted me with a handshake and asked how I was doing and then left.

And now he always smile and greets me every time he sees me, I don't want to sound like he likes me because I know this is very common for guys to do and I do it too with my other coworkers.  The thing is that there's something special about this guy and I really want to meet him. I can't help but feel stupid because everytime I see him I get nervous and I just can't seem to go past a ""hi, I'm good"".

Last week I decided to take my first step and went to his area to get ""something"" (of course it was an excuse) and decided to ask him something trivial about his job, he nicely replied and he asked me the same question. We chatted for less than 2 minutes but I felt so good. Two days later I wanted to talk to him so badly but I didn't have any reason to go to his area, so I decided at the end of my shift to buy some candies and chat with him a little (sometimes he's at the checkout). He remembered the things we chatted about last time, which was really cool, and I can't help but feel he was a little nervous too. 

So, my question is, how would you guys approach someone to go past a ""hi, how are you doing?"". I really want to meet this guy but our work conditions make it impossible to chat while working. Should I try to talk to him as soon as he gets in the store? do you guys think he's just being friendly? I though about asking him for his Facebook or any social media just to try and chat more outside job but I feel like it's too soon to ask for that info and I don't want to be seen as a stalker. Any tips are appreciated.
