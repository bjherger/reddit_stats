So I live 30 minutes from NYC and I met this guy on an online app last week. He's originally from upstate New York, approximately 10 hours away, and he was here for a job interview. We spoke for a couple of days and my friends and I decided to go out for some drinks. I invited him to come hang out with us and he came out for about an hour and a half before he had to leave to catch the bus that night to head back home. Now while I was at the train station dropping him off we talked a bit and I asked if i could give him a kiss goodbye and ended up kissing him on the cheek. We hugged for what seemed like forever and then we had this (what seemed to me) intense eye contact. I felt anxious and I sent him off on the train. Was I dumb and read the signals wrong? I don't really know what to make of how he felt that night. I do like him a lot I think he's really cute and down to earth but I don't want to come off as super clingy and potentially scare him away. Especially considering we only met and hung out for 2 hours.


So we exchanged numbers and we added each other on Facebook and we are talking casually but I can't stop thinking about him the whole day. He thanked me for suggesting to take the train back to the city and since then our conversations have been very on and off. Like I would always message him first and he would often reply with what seems to me to be quick yes and no type answers. I don't know how to approach this or decipher how he feels. Am I being dumb and over thinking a little? I'm trying to tell myself to calm down but I really don't want to waste my time crushing on some guy that might not like me back.

Any advice would be appreciated. I just don't know how to wrap my head around what's going on.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I posted this before but there was zero visibility on it except for one redditor and I wanted more opinions, thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

23 year old, pretty-much-almost-out-of-the-closet guy here. 

So I'm getting very curious about actually using grindr to meet someone (rather than just browsing like I have been in the past).  The thing is, I'm pretty nervous about a random hookup - whether the person will like me/whether I'll be comfortable with it/how far things might go/what I might feel like afterwards if things don't work out etc. 

Thus far in my history of doing gay things, I've had a boyfriend for about a month a year ago, and been on a few dates since then.  I only really was intimate with my ex boyfriend though, and we had not quite made it to anal sex by the time things ended.  So I'm in the early stages of things I guess.  

Question to the gaybros - should I just go for it and hookup with a random person?  Should I keep on dating to meet someone I actually might like and take things slow with?  What were your earlier experiences like when you were getting started with things?

I moved to a new city last year for my previous job. Three months ago I got laid off. For the past three months I went through more than 20 job interviews, unfortunately, got rejected by every single one. All my friends are far away, and I barely know anyone in this city. The worst part was, my guy decided to end things with me out of the blue after 3 years. We planned a future together, and I even came out to my family that I no longer speak to with his support.

Now, I can't eat, I can't sleep and I don't know how to keep going.

I can't afford to visit him right now, and he rarely contacts me.

But I cant help but feel if this were a woman or a straight dude or a friend of a friend I already knew there would be no issue even if I didnt tell my bf. And my bf doesnt know im still talking to randoms on grindr and have no intention of stopping anytime soon.

Though I doubt that will actually happen, I am confident that this has benefited our friendship, as we really do trust each other.

Bottom line: I told him and we're still planning to do everything we wanted to do before I came out to him. That's what being a great friend is all about!

A quick summary of the conversation:

Me: Hopefully this isn't a huge surprise to you, but I'm gay and didn't want to wait the entire summer to tell everyone. Thanks for having my back.

Him: I am not surprised you are gay. Whatever your choices are, you are nonetheless a good friend.

Should I ask him for his real intention before I agree to go with him? Or is that a dick move?
