It's also a somewhat homophobic one so people generally aren't out but gay-friendly clubs and bars still exist. Anyway, I've started playing the dating game, seeing how I'm 18 and am wholly inexperienced in that area -- I haven't even had my first kiss. Couple that with social anxiety, being an introvert on the asocial side (trying to improve that) and what you get is pretty much an uninteresting guy to everyone but few. 

Anyway, on my second ""real"" date ever, I went out with this wonderful guy called Zack, 21 years of age. We made contact on a dating app because I noticed he likes games which is, well, a huge part of my life so of course I would make contact. The date went... weirdly, I'd say. The plan was to go to a gay-friendly cafe and get to know each other but since this was yesterday, Friday night, all the places were filled and they were loud. We settled on walking and talking. For three and a half hours we walked and talked, with him generally leading the conversation. I pretty much immediately fell for him, his general nerdiness, confidence, his boyish looks and his plain, square glasses which I always find incredibly attractive. His smartness was also apparent which was the straw that broke the camel's back -- I was really into this guy called Zack!

From his body language, though, I could tell he was less impressed. He rarely looked in my direction while talking, and he hadn't made any physical signs of affection. I wanted to kiss him on many occasions as we were walking in secluded parts but I didn't. At one point, we got on the subject of our type of guy. I don't remember the specifics of what his type was but as the boxes were being left unchecked, such as being tall, muscular, older, I knew I wasn't it. I mustered up the courage to ask him, our eyes for the first time actually interlocked, and he immediately says no, I'm not the type. My gut fell inwards and I remember going from being in this wonderful state of walking in a conversation-induced haze where I didn't even know where we were walking, mesmerized by this wonderful guy, to crashing down back on Earth, where I was just another kid afraid of stepping into the real world.

We walked for another 45 minutes I'd say until my back was so sore I couldn't bare it any longer. At the crossroads where we parted ways, he offered a hand to shake, all too ready to replace a hug or a kiss. I just smirked at it, shook him and said my brief goodbyes. Because I still had the mode engaged where I automatically shut-off any signs of affection, I texted him saying how I had a great time and how I really liked him, found him beautiful and whatnot but also that I feel like I shouldn't expect anything more than friendship. He confirmed, citing age and me not being his type.

Still, I feel compelled to be persistent. We get along over the internet like we've known each other for months, building on each other's jokes and such. While there's no chemistry that would start a whole lust-lead affair, I felt connected to him on a deeper, more intellectual level and that's pretty much what I'm looking for. 

My gay gurus, I promise I won't describe every date I take from now on but I need advice, advice on whether or not to pursue something more, start showing him actual affection, unafraid of the reaction, or whether I should forget and move on, keep him as a friend, an older guide in this strange world of gay dating?

Edit: 

Thank you good people, this whole thing was a good learning experience. It's growing pains, I feel, and it's the kind that hurts a lot but also the kind that will be remembered for a good, long time. Now that I think about it, I feel lucky I was able to find someone kind-hearted, someone who gave a damn to teach this kid he has never met before, things about the real world and how it is to live as a gay man. That's how I chose to interpret it, anyway, it beats wallowing in sadness.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;#39;m an 18yo guy living in a half-million people city.

I'm a 23 year old gay male, who came out almost 2 years ago.  My straight friends have all been very supportive, treat me no different than they did before, and have been great people (which makes me super happy). However, when I came out to my few gay friends they seemed to distance themselves from me and for many of them we don't even talk anymore. It just seems...strange to me I guess. 

Then a year ago I moved to the other side of the country for school. I started using Grindr and Jackd to make friends since I was new to the area (I know...not exactly their recommended function). And for a brief period of time, I actually made a few gay friends. It was nice because I could actually talk about guys and other topics that just don't come up with my straight friends that much. But sure enough, a few months later, they just grew distant and eventually stopped responding to anything. 

One moved away to another country for a study abroad for a few months and said that we would keep in touch, but it never happened. He stopped returning any communication efforts and then eventually defriended me on facebook and everything. Another just stopped talking to me and then disappeared practically. Just today, I was talking with someone I have interacted with before and we were friends on social media and he's completely out. He find's out I'm gay via an offhand comment and then later in the day he just blocks me from all social media.

I know this situation is kind of silly. I don't know what's wrong with me (if anything). It's not that I NEED a gay friend. I'm just concerned that if I can't even make a gay friend and keep them...how in the world am I ever going to be in a relationship with a guy.

So I'm in a bit of an awkward situation involving my dating life: I'm a 17 year old senior in high school who's somewhat of a romantic and  prefers to date college aged guys and older. I just find that I don't get along too well with dates my age. The ones that I have been on just made me feel like every high schooler is immature. I also noticed through (platonic) online chats that I like talking to people 2-8 years older than me. This would usually be fine if I were in college or entering the workforce like other 20-28 year olds, but I'm still in high school. The differences between both points in life are extreme!

So my questions are: Is it appropriate for me to court 20-28 year olds? ; Is it taboo? ; How should I go about trying to date them? I really just need some advice. 

Recently I made a Tinder that claims I'm 18 so I can see guys outside of the 13-17 range. It's not to much of a difference from my real age (my 18th birthday is in August), and I disclose that I'm not 18 in my bio. Also, age of consent in my state is 17. I matched with this guy (23 years old) who I had a great conversation with... until he realized that I was 17 and told me I was just too young. Anything I can do in that situation?

Much thanks, bros!

I've always been a reader of various subreddits but it's my first time having an account and more, posting something on my own.

A little background. I'm 22, and have had several flings and three serious relationships with girls for the past, so obviously, it's my first time having a boyfriend. Whether I was gay to begin with, only realizing it now, I don't know, I don't care, whatever, that's not the point of this post. The same goes for my partner, who's 20, and had two heterosexual relationships in the past, and obviously, that makes me his first boyfriend. This relationship, of course, is something ""hidden"" from our friends and families.

So as you guys have concluded, both of us are new to this. We are having small fights every now and then, but a day won't pass that we won't have those fixed. Both of us were reluctant at sex at first, bottoming was painful, but everything went pleasurable afterwards. Everything seems to be going great, with both of us telling how we never loved another person as much as we do now, and that both of us are thinking about our future, as a family and stuff. All those cheesy thoughts.

Until we have one big fight recently. I think it started as I tried to invite him in some event (a circuit dog show) with me, thinking that he might enjoy it, with both of us being dog lovers and all. He rejected me, and I blurted out things, that he did reject because he's not interested in that event even if I'm going there. I mentioned that he is so used to the usual dinner and movie dates with his ex girlfriend, that he doesn't bother going to random events and activities such as this. He then argued that that's not the case, and how I'm such close minded about this.

This turned out to be a really big argument, with him just laughing and ridiculing at anything and everything I said. I felt disrespected, but he just blurted that he's laughing just because he founds everything I said as funny. Which is, obviously, not the case for me. He begins to become arrogant telling me that he never lost an argument before, and that he won't lose this one either. I told him he's being senseless and arrogant, and all.

Obviously, no one was willing to admit his wrong, nor succumb to the fact that he's basically, losing this argument. He said he's disappointed that I said mean things about him, that I don't care about him at all. Well I did tell him too, that I've never had someone ridicule me the same way as he did. I don't know, reddit. This may be a small thing for you guys, but it's a big deal to me, because I feel like everything's falling apart already. If there are two things I'm sure of, that is I love him so much and I'd do anything to save this relationship.

I'm sorry for posting such childish or not-that-big-of-a-problem here, but I'm hoping someone could just show a piece of advice. This is my first homosexual relationship. I'm thinking that as both of us are naturally men, that both of us has dominating, somehow clashing personalities and all. I don't know.

I'm not a ""sissy boy"" but somehow people can tell that i am gay and i fucking hate that. 

I have a straight coworker who makes me feel like i don't worth a penny every time i see him. His looks, natural masculinity and confidence make me feel like i wanna make out with him and i  wanna BE him at the same time. 

It's like a mix of desire, jealousy and guilt that i can't overcome. 

I have the same feeling with every man i have a crush on. I think that's why i'm 24 and never had a boyfriend.

I spent the new year's party sitting on the coach drinking vodka like an outsider, watching some men 
around me dancing with girls and having a good time  being themselves. just wanted to fit in, to feel like i am normal. 
Don't get me wrong. i know being gay it's okay but i don't know how to explain it. I feel different from the other guys. 

I don't want to spend the rest of my life wishing i was another man. But i don't have a great body. Im too skynny and i hate my job. 

Please please tell me if i am the only one who feels that way.

I also happen to be skinny and look a little younger than my age at 24.

Just wanted to have a little discussion: Personally, I'm attracted to white guys, Latinos and Middle Easterners, and in particular, guys who are a bit older than myself as I feel they're a bit more mature in attitude (just my perception). 

It does seem like a disproportionate number of white guys post things on adam4adam and Grindr like ""no Asians"" or stuff like that. I understand that, it's a matter of sexual preferences.

Quite a few other ones who don't say such things and I share a face pic with, tell me that I'm cute or handsome but am not their type.

My skin is pretty white, my eyes look semi-Asian, I have black hair, etc so my physical appearance isn't dominated by what you would expect from either race, it's nearly balanced, perhaps leaning a bit more towards the white side. I also have a good sized dick too (been almost a total top) that a lot of guys slobber over online so I'm not worried about it.

That being said, is there a perception that half white/half Asian guys are equivalent to Asian guys within the LGBT world? It does seem like Asian males are seen as less desirable both in the hetero world and the LGBT world, as they are stereotypically seen as effete, undersexualized, and emasculated with smaller dicks. In the Western world, you never do see Asian males as being sex symbols (Asian women being the exception), instead they are seen as number crunchers who would rather hit the books.

Meanwhile, if you want to talk about black males, how many times have we seen guys online who constantly say they want big black you know what? We've seen stereotypes where black guys are hypermasculinized, seen as having big you-know-whats and are highly sexual. In fact, it seems like a lot of white guys are simply into black guys for the big D and nothing more.

I am not trying to open a forum for a flame war, but I think that this is a good topic to be discussed about the social constructions of race within the LGBT community. As a half-Asian/half white guy, most non-multiracial people see me as a curiosity (the question ""What are you?"" is something that is often asked, even by Asians too) and often guess that I'm either fully Asian, or fully white, but not in between.

So there's this guy at my workplace. We're both in university, working at the library. This past semester, we were in the same 100 level science lecture and lab, which we both struggled in. Before this, I'd see him around, but didn't know him. Then, one day, he wanders into the office in the library that I work in, and while checking out the master key, asks me how I had done on the previous exam. I fibbed and said that I had gotten a 68% (I had actually gotten a 42%). At this point I still hadn't realized who he was, so I said something about my TA from my lab, just making conversation. He says we're in the same lab.

Oh fuck. This is super embarrassing. 

So I just blaze right onward, changing the subject. We have an awkwardly long conversation. Afterward, I see him in the library all the time. We both manage to pass the class with a C, and have more awkward conversations. I see him right before finals are over, we talk, OkSeeYaRound.jpg. Now we're both back from home for the holidays, working, but the semester hasn't started yet. Today he comes by my office again to get something from the supply closet, and we talk again. It's mostly casual conversation and more bitching about how bad that class was from both of us. Then we talk about windows XP (he works in the computer repair area). I run out of stuff to say, and we are at work, so things die out and he heads back. 

At first I was fairly sure he was just a nice straight guy, but now I'm just baffled. I don't think this is me seeing things that aren't there, because I'm never really the one who starts the conversation and he always seems to want to take things further than a casual hello. I'm neither hyper-masculine nor hyper-effeminate, just kinda average, and neither of us have really said anything to indicate any preference, so I'm still inclined to say he's straight. I think that what makes me second-guess myself is that every time we talk it seems like he wants to just keep chatting forever, which is fine except that I'm really bad at small talk. The conversation always ends with me just sorta sitting there in silence for a while and then he'll excuse himself back to work. He also maintains really consistent eye contact, like to an off-putting degree.

However, my gaydar is simply nonexistent. I've had people approach me in public before for random things like cigarettes or directions, and then later had friends clue me in that I was being hit on. Also, I've only been out since last August, so I don't know what's going on anyway as far as man-dating goes. I just can't tell if he's into me or what. I'd be interested if he was, but it wouldn't really bother me too much if he wasn't. 

So anyways: tl;dr: Just another newly-out gay kid can't tell if a coworker is just really nice or is hitting on me.

Obligatory question: How did you approach a guy for the first time? Was it casual, or did you just straight up ask him if he was straight, or out yourself?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys, I&amp;#39;ve been following &lt;a href=""/r/askgaybros""&gt;/r/askgaybros&lt;/a&gt; for a while, so I know how common these threads are, but I just need to vent for 2 seconds, not really looking for advice. &lt;/p&gt;

Firstly hi,

I've been (bi)curious for a few years but never acted upon it, I feel I'm ready to try now. Just have a few questions if nobody minds;

Just wondering how safe CL/Grindr really are, I'm in my mid twenties in Sydney, Australia. What should I look out for (to avoid)?

How risky is un-protected oral sex and is it weird that I want the first few times to be protected?

Is a proper cleaning in the shower with soap and a washcloth enough or is an enema/douche required?

Thanks","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edit: Had my first taster, loved it :)&lt;/p&gt;

I really need some support. I'm sorry to keep on posting about this same guy over and over but I don't have a lot of gay friends I can just call and talk about this. I have a lot of gay friends but they all see me as the fresh guy since I've only been out for a year. I feel like a child when I express myself to them with my dating problems.

I hope someone can relate to me on this or tell me what I'm feeling is normal.

But...

I posted the other day about someone saying they love me, then they disappeared the next day. This was on NYE and then haven't heard from him since.

LINK: [I WANT TO FALL IN LOVE WITH YOU](http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/2r7t2r/i_want_to_fall_in_love_with_you/)

I go to a coffee shop yesterday to pay my PA some lunch during a video shoot, and I don't even see him and his group of friends at a table but he saw me. 

At this point, I still haven't seen or heard from him since he told me he loved me.

He texted me but I'm ordering. I then sit down with my PA and his table yells out to me to say hey.

I'm stunned. 

I play it cool but show I'm not in a great mood to see him.

He tries to include me in their conversation and is joking. I then see the text he sent 10 minutes ago.

Says the kiss we had on NYE was just a kiss and a hook-up and he shouldn't have done it since I apparently was showing my persistence to see him since then. I was showing I was interested. This was the 5th time we've hooked up in a year but the last time we hooked-up on NYE, he says that he thinks about me every-time he touches himself and he's with another lover. He was admitting his feelings for me out-loud so of course I want to see him and of course it confused me.

So...we had a kiss on NYE and hooked up but we did the same the year before at the same party but this year he tells me he's in love with me then takes it back.

I don't know how to react but I pay attention to my PA and he knows everything that is going on.

They leave and I just sit there for an hour and write out a letter to him on my phone. I don't send it to him though. I only wrote it to get my thoughts out.

I get more work done and head home. I cry of course. Then around 1am I finally responded to his text and acted cool and said I was only persistent because I was horny and wanted to have some fun with him because when we were in bed NYE, we were saying all the dirty things we wanted to do the next day. I ended the text with how I need to block him out of my life because of how toxic I become around him and that I'm sorry I ruined a friendship. I just wanted to be his lover for a day.

The opposite is true. I want to be with him and he knows that but I didn't want to admit because of him ignoring me after NYE.

So I blocked him on everything. We run in the same social circle so I know it's going to cause some issues with our friends with this small city I live in. It's a very gossipy city.

I already had a friend call me yesterday asking about it and was on my side. It was nice to hear that but it's clearly getting out there. Not surprised.

I love my town but that's the only downside of living here. Everyone knows everything. I'll probably run into him today. I live in a 20-something city so you see the same people everyday,

**TL;DR**

Lover for a year (the guy I came out of the closet for) has the same NYE kiss we had a year ago and tells me he's falling for me and is in love. Disappears.

Don't see him for days and randomly run into him at coffee shop where he texts me saying it all meant nothing.

So I blocked him. Need to quit wasting energy on this person despite the feelings I have for him. I don't want to lose him and would rather have him as a friend.

Will blocking him online and his number fix this?

**Sidenote**: We run into each other ALL THE TIME. He lives one street from me and we have the same friends.

Long-time lurker of this sub, first time poster. This sub is wonderful.


I'm 22. (Started discovering myself last year; hooked up with a few guys, and had one relationship for 3 months) So, last November, I met this guy at a college party (Let's call him ""Brian""). I told Brian that I liked him, and he said he liked me too. We ended up going to my place, and we... had sex (he was a virgin) and cuddled until morning and it was great. Brian had warned me that he and his family were moving to another country ""soon"" (no final date yet, he didn't know) and I was fine with that. 


Even after he had left, we were still texting and Facebook messaging each other. He helped me throughout finals week, just by texting me, motivating me. After finals week (around December), Brian and I had met each other maybe 5-6 times. Eating, chilling at my place, watching movies, and we would always sleep together (or at least cuddled).


We were never 'together' though. So I met up with / dated a couple of guys. I actually became close with this other guy.  But I always had a special place in my heart for Brian.


So Brian and I meet up today. We eat, talk, laugh, cuddle a bit, etc. Then he tells me they have a final date when he and his family would be leaving out-of-the-country.. He was leaving... 2 weeks from now. And he'd be really busy for the next few days. So basically that would be the last time I'd ever get to see him. (We'd still get to text each other, but I'll never get to touch / cuddle with him and all)


I was a little emotionally crushed. Cause I had really gotten attached to Brian. He actually had to be the one to comfort me before he left. (Honestly, I was about to cry.) He said he would miss me too, but he was looking forward to his new life in another country. I didn't even have the courage to tell him that I love him. (He wasn't really that type of guy.)


So yeah, I'm just sitting here, partially drunk, trying to forget. Like, my ex has broke up with me before, but I didn't have really deep feelings for my ex. But with Brian, I'll really miss the way I held him, how we just had so much fun together, how much he comforted me when I had issues, how soft his skin was. I'm just... really down. I just want some tips on how ""cope"", how to deal with losing someone who I really really liked.


I know it's a little immature; I'm not totally shattered, just really bummed. But I recognise this isn't the worst problem in the world, and I have a *lot* to be thankful for in life in general. Also, this isn't really a ""gay"" problem, but I've lurked so long in this sub it feels natural to say this here without too harsh judgement.

Anyway sorry for the long rant. TL;DR is the post title. I'd really really appreciate any constructive advice and what not. Thanks everyone! Thanks for reading.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey! Long-time lurker of this sub, first time poster. This sub is wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m 22. (Started discovering myself last year; hooked up with a few guys, and had one relationship for 3 months) So, last November, I met this guy at a college party (Let&amp;#39;s call him &amp;quot;Brian&amp;quot;). I told Brian that I liked him, and he said he liked me too. We ended up going to my place, and we... had sex (he was a virgin) and cuddled until morning and it was great. Brian had warned me that he and his family were moving to another country &amp;quot;soon&amp;quot; (no final date yet, he didn&amp;#39;t know) and I was fine with that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even after he had left, we were still texting and Facebook messaging each other. He helped me throughout finals week, just by texting me, motivating me. After finals week (around December), Brian and I had met each other maybe 5-6 times. Eating, chilling at my place, watching movies, and we would always sleep together (or at least cuddled).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were never &amp;#39;together&amp;#39; though. So I met up with / dated a couple of guys. I actually became close with this other guy.  But I always had a special place in my heart for Brian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Brian and I meet up today. We eat, talk, laugh, cuddle a bit, etc. Then he tells me they have a final date when he and his family would be leaving out-of-the-country.. He was leaving... 2 weeks from now. And he&amp;#39;d be really busy for the next few days. So basically that would be the last time I&amp;#39;d ever get to see him. (We&amp;#39;d still get to text each other, but I&amp;#39;ll never get to touch / cuddle with him and all)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was a little emotionally crushed. Cause I had really gotten attached to Brian. He actually had to be the one to comfort me before he left. (Honestly, I was about to cry.) He said he would miss me too, but he was looking forward to his new life in another country. I didn&amp;#39;t even have the courage to tell him that I love him. (He wasn&amp;#39;t really that type of guy.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah, I&amp;#39;m just sitting here, partially drunk, trying to forget. Like, my ex has broke up with me before, but I didn&amp;#39;t have really deep feelings for my ex. But with Brian, I&amp;#39;ll really miss the way I held him, how we just had so much fun together, how much he comforted me when I had issues, how soft his skin was. I&amp;#39;m just... really down. I just want some tips on how &amp;quot;cope&amp;quot;, how to deal with losing someone who I really really liked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know it&amp;#39;s a little immature; I&amp;#39;m not totally shattered, just really bummed. But I recognise this isn&amp;#39;t the worst problem in the world, and I have a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; to be thankful for in life in general. Also, this isn&amp;#39;t really a &amp;quot;gay&amp;quot; problem, but I&amp;#39;ve lurked so long in this sub it feels natural to say this here without too harsh judgement.
.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.
Anyway sorry for the long rant. TL;DR is the post title. I&amp;#39;d really really appreciate any constructive advice and what not. Thanks everyone! Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm making a throwaway just to be safe. This is a mountain of text, so I apologize.  I've placed a TL;DR at the bottom.

I'm in a fairly young relationship, that by most metrics has gone well. We generally make one another happier than not, and we are both always wanting to spend time together. We've been dating for about 6 months. After an argument with my boyfriend, I'm evaluating the relationship as it is now and how it has progressed over the last 6 months. He is a few years older than I am, and we are both in our twenties.



**Him (let's call him Johnny):**

*The Good -* Johnny is an incredibly loyal, sweet and genuine man. He is wildly crazy about me, and **he has never made me doubt his feelings for me.** He initiates sex pretty much every time he sees me, he constantly affirms his attraction for me, **has expressed that he loves me, and is clearly over-the-moon about me. We see each other 4 to 6 days a week.** In contrast to my relationship with my most recent ex, it has been really nice to feel wanted and appreciated. For all of the faults to come, and regardless of what happens between the two of us, I will forever defend his character and genuinely good ""soul,"" for lack of a better word. 



**Me (let's call me, me):**
I can't definitively differentiate what is good or bad in myself. I'm biased as fuck. So, let me just give you bros the general details about myself as they relate to dating me, with an attempt to include what I see as the biggest challenges someone would face in dating me.

**I'm ambitious, possibly to a fault. I'm neurotic, definitely to a fault. I have issues with perfectionism, cleanliness, and general control of my environment and my situations. I'm obtaining my doctorate from the number one ranked program in my field and am in the process of starting a business.** I am confident in my intellect and my passions, as well as my ability to advance through my field, but I also actively try and remain humble. The humility being noted, I am aware I sometimes come off as a know-it-all or as if I'm trying to show people up. I am aware of this, I really am, and I try very hard to avoid bragging (even to the point that I actively rework conversations away from the topic of what I do for research/school). Unfortunately, even with all of these efforts on my part, **Johnny still often feels intellectually inadequate. He has expressed that he is worried he is too dumb for me (his words).** Any attempts I've tried at a more intellectually-oriented conversation (from discussing religion and politics, to music, to literature, to my research) have been met with an honest, but failed, attempt to keep up. Invariably, he has left every conversation frustrated. He is really competitive, and kind of a sore loser, and I think he views it as ""losing,"" or something. I don't really know what to do, and while I've talked to him about it, he never finds the words to appropriately express it.


**The Side-by-Side of us:**

*Goals*

I plan on starting a company in the near future, I'm successful in my field (especially for my age), I will have a highly lucrative and sought-after degree in the near future, I have no debt, and I intend to dedicate my life to work that improves human disease outcomes. I want to find a partner to share my life with, to travel the world with, and to enjoy on a daily basis. I don't particularly want kids.

Johnny has no ambition. Despite being a few years older than I am he is still in community college pursuing something he doesn't really like. He knows he wants to settle down eventually with the right guy, and would like to start a family with that guy.

*Hobbies and Interests*

I love to read, I enjoy video games, I am a major music junkie (rock/blues/progressive/alternative especially), I love going out and camping, playing soccer or whatever else, going for a run with friends, taking a random weekend trip, driving around for the fuck of it, and a lot more. I'm passionate about my career, about politics, and about philosophy and general existentialism. I'm an atheist, which bothers him a little, but I'm first and foremost a humanist. 

Johnny likes a couple of video games, cartoons, reality tv, hates reading, only likes pop music (which is cool at the club, but I get sick of it constantly), despises discussing serious topics like those I mentioned before, and ""just wants to have fun."" He is ""spiritual"" but not dogmatic. He definitely believes, or at least wants to believe, in a higher power of sorts with an afterlife. He uses his lack of education as an excuse often. 

*Sex*

I'm about 60% bottom and 40% top. I'm also very kink-friendly and have in the past enjoyed it a lot. I have very high stamina (45 minutes to multiple hours), as well as a typically-high sex drive.

Johnny is 100% top, totally vanilla and opposed to kink, and he has some ED issues and about 10 minutes of stamina. I've only ever been able to finish while bottoming for him twice, and every other time I've had to jerk off later. He isn't trying to be selfish, and makes great effort to go longer, but simply can't. He also refuses to bottom for me generally. We've tried a few times, with failed results. He routinely gets frustrated with me for not initiating sex often enough or allowing him to see his initiation of it all the way through. It makes him feel like I don't find him attractive, which is very false. I just have a hard time motivating myself to make a mess of my ass for him to get off while I'm left horny and covered in lube.

*My Problems With Him*

He still smokes (e-cigs). He smokes pot too much, he drinks too much, too often, and despite saying he wants to settle down and shit, I don't really see evidence of that. He caves to his friends' wills very easily, and is almost always instantly swayed by them. Though I think their intents are to protect him, they've insinuated that I am stringing him along until I find someone better, which is abhorrently false - I spend ALL of my free time with him and I love him (just not in love with him yet). He lacks logic on many fronts (but he isn't stupid, just has a different mind than mine). He is insanely jealous. 

If he stays on his current trajectory, he is going to either end up in jail for stupid delinquencies that a teen can get a way with, but a 30-year-old can't. If he does manage to avoid prison, he is going to die by 50 from cirrhosis of his liver, cancer from smoking, or some combination therein. I don't want to fall in love with someone who I have to watch die 20 years before me, barring my untimely demise.

***Help Me:***

I provided you all with that information primarily as a way for me to vent, but also because I'm sort of hoping, on some level, that someone will say these differences are reconcilable. I want to believe I could spend my life with him, but I don't believe that right now. 

With that, because I've completely failed to figure out a scenario in which we are actually compatible, my current intent is to break up with him before his love for me grows deeper. I love him, but not really in the way of romance. I love who he is at his core, the good and generosity in him, the naivety, the desire to please, and his ability to love me despite all of my faults. I love him for the good traits he has, but I'm also not capable of letting go of *all* of the traits/habits I find problematic. We are coming up on our 6 month anniversary, we have really big plans in the immediate future with two friends (and ruining these plans by a breakup would be out of the question - I refuse to do it). How and when do I break up with him? How do I break up with one of the best humans I've ever met, who just isn't right for me, and for whom I also am not right? This is going to crush him (and me on a different level). It is not going to be pretty, and I severely doubt we will remain friends after I do this, which crushes me more than I can express. He has done nothing *wrong* per se. Things just aren't right. We have a HUGE overlap in our worlds where we both live in terms of people we know and the places we go, and I'm a bit scared that he is going to blacklist me from our entire community for breaking his heart. 


**TL;DR:** My boyfriend and I are, seemingly, incompatible in a variety of ways, but he is the most wonderfully sweet man I've ever been with, and he loves me to a fault. Short of some relationship-saving insight, I need to break up with him as gently and cleanly as possible before he falls more in love with me, and I have no idea how to break up with someone I love. Further, we have a HUGE overlap in our worlds where we both live in terms of people we know and the places we go, and I'm a bit scared that he is going to blacklist me from our entire community for breaking his heart. 

Please, help. What do I do, and how? I've tried very hard to present all of this with as little bias as I could, as well as honestly as I could manage. If I'm the prick here, please tell me. He is a better human than me, I don't doubt that. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi bros. I&amp;#39;m making a throwaway just to be safe.
