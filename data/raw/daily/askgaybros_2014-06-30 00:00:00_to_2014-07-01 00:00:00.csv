However, one day I changed my picture and he sent me a text message ""hey, nice smile"" and my heart skipped a bit. 

Long story short, we became close, ran into each other unexpectedly twice and went movie date three times and went twice for lunch/dinner. He asked me to add him on whatsapp and we chat almost everyday (usually I am the one who says hi first and he doesn't seem annoyed by that, in fact, he said he will tell me if I am getting too nosy). He knows I am a pretty hardcore stalker (i.e. liking almost every single photo he posted online - he does the same too btw, asking him super random questions on formspring and he replies almost all of them and I had fun teasing him and sending him super cheesy flirts anonymously until I got busted one day) and I think he's okay with that. We didn't do anything past the first base except that *handshake which he scratched my palm with one of his finger* - I'm guessing this doesn't really mean anything.

The thing is, I kinda like the guy (he's 39 and I'm 23 btw) as we have similar interests (same genre of movies, he also likes fantasy novels, etc.) but just this last weekend he was talking about this guy he has a crush on, that he's going to have a surprise for him during his birthday dinner and I was kind of surprised by that fact. Hearing that, I immediately went all sarcastic towards him and amazingly, he wasn't angry or whatever and that made me feel bad about it. I said to him I'm jealous of that guy and he said I shouldn't be, as my turn will soon come and I will enjoy it. (Actually, when I was mad I asked him to tell me about the other guy, he said it's a long story and he said we should not talk about it as he *felt bad* talking about him.)

Guys, I am completely insecure about this. Usually every other guy I met online would just turn me down/ignore me when they found out that I am a super-stalker, nosy, and attention seeker. I guess he absolutely knows that I like him, but I don't know about him. This weekend he's inviting me to stay over. Of course I am happy, but, *do you guys think that he has a feeling towards me or he just wants me as a fuck buddy or maybe I am just a friend, or he's just a player*? (Not that it's a bad thing, but I guess it's not really my thing).

I am a recent college graduate with a B.A. in History with Elementary Education. I will have an elementary license, but in Colorado I had to get a BA in something, so I chose history because I hate math.
While I want to teach, I would also be okay pursuing other career or somewhat temporary options.
I like teaching in that I like being around kids every day and I like the whole teaching/learning/school environment. However, I dislike the low pay and insane amount of paperwork involved (outside of grading papers).
I've been searching for teaching jobs but I haven't found anything yet. As such, I'm open to other jobs that pay well enough for me to live on my own. In other words, I don't want to work at Burger King and live with my parents. I understand that it is still a bit early to find a teaching job, but I feel it would be smart to pursue other options in case I can't find a teaching job. Subbing is always an option but it seems that subbing can be very sporatic and would be difficult to live on. I currently score student assessments for Pearson, but this is a short term job. I feel that having the BA in History could be beneficial in a job that is related to writing or research but I'm unaware of where to start looking.

My first relationship ended because I couldn't comfortably handle the rough sex he liked to give and we didn't see each other often enough to work through it. I've tried playing with some toys and small plugs work if I take it slow.

My IBS would have me going to the bathroom a lot and this spring saw a lot more expulsion than necessary. My bowels basically spasm-ed and I experienced pretty ridiculous diarrhea that I tried to control and ended up feeling very drained by. But just before that tried bottoming for a guy who had a pretty big tool. It hurt a lot. I almost couldn't finish if we weren't making out. The next day I was pretty sore. My doctor had previously prescribed me a hemorrhoidal ointment because my IBS had me going so often all the wiping ended up making it very dry and inflamed. Applying it helps. I asked two doctors if receptive anal sex would irritate my colon and cause the terrible bout of diarrhea I had. Both said that it could become a bit irritated but the symptoms of my condition would be from conditions throughout my intestine.

I think I've developed hemorrhoids. Recently I tried bottoming for a guy with a very small penis and it was generally a good time. When it inserted I felt stinging in very particular areas around the anus. When we finished and I went to the bathroom there was a small amount of blood with some expelled lube. Also when I try fingering myself I can feel small bumps around my sphincter. They're pretty miniscule but definitely there. 

I experience the same bit of blood when I try using a plug. I've had minor bleeding from larger men as well but ultimately I get very uncomfortable trying to take it. I like to call myself vers because I don't want to feel limited and both positions can be effectively satisfying. But a lot of guys I'm very interested in seem really capable of giving and taking. I'd really like to experience both of which but I feel like there's some sort of size limit I need to impose. So with that I have a few questions to ask:


I don't believe relaxation is the issue and I know not all asses are created equal so does that make me too tight? Is that a thing?


Is the presence of hemorrhoids a deal breaker for a prospective bottom? Anyone else (s)experience the same issue?


Is blood a big deal or is it just the hemorrhoids? Is it still a big deal anyways?


How can one become a more talented bottom? I don't know if it's just the end of it or if my limits can really be tested.


Am I better off sticking to exclusive topping? The idea of bottoming can be really hot but limiting myself sounds like a huge bummer.

Edit: my IBS is being managed and most of my concerns are around the general discomfort of bottoming.

Okay ideas

* cleaning in my underwear. I've actually seen people advertise this on CL. Like cleaning a room of the house or wash a car. 
* Cuddling. Fully clothed just cuddle with a person for whatever amount of time. This girl I read about actually does this as her full time job in portland.
* Just going on dates, like to dinner and a movie
* Massages. I'm not sure how that works though, but would be willing to give 'erotic massage' Not sure if I need to be certified to do that.. maybe just back rubs. 
* Consulting people, or just listening to someone's problems. I actually know a lot of about nutrition and psychology but don't really put it to use. 

What else? And one more important question, say if you had to pay for these things, how much would you be willing to shell out for these 5 things? Like say it was an hours worth of time for each?

I mean, a *lifestyle* is whether you're a vegetarian or how often you go to the gym, or whether you work in an office park or a tree farm. Whether you're sleeping with men or women doesn't reshape your whole life.

After months (well, over a year) of gradual self introduction via porn, I decided that it was time to see how I would fare to the same sex. 

Now, I've never considered myself too terribly attractive, definitely not *hot* by any means, but good lord, I have been swarmed with an onslaught of sexual offers and remarks that I'm attractive. 

I've definitely been hit on by guys in the past, and I was always flattered. Like I said, I'm quite surprised.

Anyway, excuse me if I'm just terribly naive, but is all of this attention mainly due to the fact that I'm new on the scene (I live in semi-rural NH, though there are a lot of guys on there) and am being preyed upon like fresh meat?  

I'm not looking to hookup anytime soon. I'll be waiting until I get back to school, and then I would like to actually get to know the guy. I mainly created this out of curiosity. 

Thanks for any insight, bros, I found this sub last night and really like the community that it offers.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey there fellas, I&amp;#39;m a college student that has recently discovered that I do indeed have a sexual attraction to men.
