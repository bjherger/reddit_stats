Right when I thought we were gonna meet, he starts getting weird on me, making up excuses about why he can't talk, etc. After weeks getting more and more shitty towards me he tells me it was all a joke and he was just bored.

After feeling stupid and heartbroken, lesson learned. I never wanted to talk to him again. Then recently, he contacts me. He starts by apologizing profusely. There was no question of ""taking him back"", since I told him I was in a relationship (and it would never happen anyway); on the other hand, I still wanted a bit of closure to figure out wtf happened between us. So we texted back and forth for a couple days. I tell him I mostly forgive him, he opens up to me.

Granted, my suspicions about him being messed up in the head are confirmed once and for all.

However, even at this point I have limits to what I'm willing to do to him. At the end of the day he's a fucked up, mentally disturbed kid who has no clue what he wants.

So I am here to update on my last post on whether to get Grindr or not. I got it and things have escalated way too quickly. I am technically not a virgin anymore and I have a fwb that I haven't met lol.

So I understand many things that I have read over time about the app. At first the sculpted torsos did make me feel a bit bad but after talking to some guys and sharing xxx pics, i have more confidence now.

SO the biggest thing of all is that I basically had sex. I hooked up with this Mexican dude that was slightly older than me (he was 25/26, and I'm 23). Initially we hit it off and we went for coffee and then we went to do the nasty.

We took a shower and then he kissed me (my first kiss). He said I was pretty good and was in shocked when I told him that it was my first kiss lol. Then things got hotter and we sucked each other off. He also said I was doing pretty good for a beginner (thanks porn haha). But unfortunately, being a noob, i did use some teeth (oops). But i confirmed that I do like to suck dick, i sucked it so much haha. Then he ate my ass and I ate his. And then he fucked me. But he lost his erection and he didn't cum and I wasn't hard either and didn't cum.

I thought anal was going to hurt alot but it actually didn't. It did feel weird but nothing out of the ordinary until he wanted to get into total top mode and go fast and i told him to slow down and shortly he stopped altogether as he lost his erection. 

We left the room and then he kissed me goodbye in the parking lot and said to message him. BUUUTTTT, here's the kicker, when I finally got home, he BLOCKED ME lol. Naturally my reaction was  WTF??? 

I don't have positive nor negative feelings about hooking up with him because it was okay. But I am irked that he blocked me after engaging with me after we left the room. Since he didn't cum or anything like that, I still consider myself a virgin, I'm going to act like if I just played with a dildo or something like that. I feel like I didn't complete the deed.

So that's that.

Also, I have a fwb that I haven't met. That might be fun. He's a bottom and I'm going to probs break my top virginity with him but we'll see how things go.

I know I have been saying that I wanted my first time to be with a virgin, and i was so close to achieving that but the only virgin I talked to and started clicking with started to ignore me and ultimately blocked me lol.

So it's been a crazy ride and I'm trying to process things slowly but we'll see what other adventures will come my way. Life is crazy, If you would have told me that these events would be happening to me in January, I would have laughed and said ""bullshit"".


Have a good weekend bros. As usual, I want to hear your thoughts about this.

I'm kidding about still considering myself a virgin. I just feel like it didn't count lol.

I'm sure he didn't think it would upset me, but it really did. It hurts to know that I'm not considered as an option for some gay guys. I mostly get approached only for sex and I did say yes a few times, but then I feel like shit hooking up with strangers, I don't enjoy it at all. I don't consider myself to be THAT amazing, but I don't bomb any category by any means. Maybe being more toned would help me get a boyfriend, but it's not like I'm hideous as is. Or maybe I am, but hideous people deserve love too!

What's worse is I often meet guys who ask for my number (through friends mostly) and I give it to them, but I RARELY get texted after the fact and it's depressing, I just want to go on a date like a normal person. I don't know why this is a thing, but it is. And I know there's grindr etc. But honestly I don't even want to just hook up, I'd love to have sex more often, sure, but I want to date somebody too just as much. I go back on forth on downloading it. The holidays make this 100x worse cause all of the closest people in my life are in very serious relationships. I'm at my parents house right now and my siblings are all out with their significant others and it makes me feel like I wouldn't be this single if I were straight.

I'm basically out to everyone I care for too, so honestly I don't actually know what to do at this point. I'm sure somebody will say be less desperate, but why lie? I really want a boyfriend. And I assure you I'm not desperate when meeting guys in real life. Even if I do scare some guys away, there's no way I could be scaring every guy away. I just want to know: what the hell am I doing wrong?

I know this is a rant, but I really need this right now. I can't handle taking to my parents about how they know all these nice girls who would love to date me. It just hurts to feel so alone and it feels like I'd be more dateable as a straight man. WHAT DO I EVEN DO?! I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M DOING WRONG. If somebody has overcome a similar problem please share.

Tl;Dr: my friends tell me I'm destined to die alone in a loving way and guys don't want to date me. I'm starting to think it's all a big conspiracy, but I still want to do whatever it takes to be more date-able. I just don't know what that is.

It just hurts to feel so alone and it feels like I&amp;#39;d be more dateable as a straight man. WHAT DO I EVEN DO?! I HONESTLY DON&amp;#39;T KNOW WHAT I&amp;#39;M DOING WRONG. If somebody has overcome a similar problem please share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tl;Dr: my friends tell me I&amp;#39;m destined to die alone in a loving way and guys don&amp;#39;t want to date me. I&amp;#39;m starting to think it&amp;#39;s all a big conspiracy, but I still want to do whatever it takes to be more date-able. I just don&amp;#39;t know what that is. Please help me.&lt;/p&gt;

Go ahead and explain to me why I'm a bad person. I don't think you'll change my mind, but you're welcome to try.


I'm 21. Until about 2 years ago, I was completely straight. I didn't do anything with girls in high school because I was a shy and awkward teenager. But I had crushes on girls, I jerked off to straight porn, and I never thought about boys. Until like 2 years ago. I started to like boys, but only younger. Like 13-17 mostly. That attraction has grown stronger and stronger, to the point that I no longer even self-identify as bi. I never think about girls any more. 

Once in a while I see an 18 or 19 year old who I find attractive, but it's very rare. And even then, the attraction is not nearly as strong as it is to boys a few years younger. The attraction isn't merely sexual. There's something about the personalities of boys that age, which I can't quite identify precisely, that draws me to them.

I've never had any sort of romantic or sexual experience in my life. With anyone, of any age or gender. I get overwhelmingly lonely, especially at night. I feel an emptiness inside me. I need somebody to hold and kiss and cuddle. I want to curl up on the couch and watch Netflix together. I worry that I'll never have any of that.

Morally, I'm ok with liking younger guys. I think that consent is far more important than age. I wouldn't do anything with a 13 year old, no matter how into him I am, because I wouldn't be certain that he fully understands the implications of our relationship. But with the right 15 or 16 year old, I would leave it up to them. At that age I think people are capable of making those decisions. 

My problem isn't the moral aspect. It's that I don't know how I can possibly find someone. If I was into guys my age, I would be out and normal and happy, and be able to go on dates and flirt and all of that good stuff. But since I like younger guys, I can't. I want to be able to see a cute boy and ask if he wants to get coffee. And I can't. It's incredibly frustrating.

I've used kik to find boys to talk to, and to some extent that's been successful. I've met cute boys, and I've been surprised to find that some of them are as into me as I am into them (which has been huge for my self-confidence). I just haven't been able to find any that live near me. And with each passing day, I get more and more concerned that I never will. And every night I feel more and more empty.



I don't really know what I'm looking for in posting this. I guess it's partly just a way to vent, because the only way I can tell this to anybody is anonymously. And maybe I'll find someone else out there that's gone through or is going through the same thing. But it feels good to write it down, and that's a good enough reason for me. Let me know if you have questions or whatever.

So, I've got a profile on OKC and that's seen some limited success, but judging by my friends' experiences I'm a billion times more likely to meet someone via the gay apps (even after excluding everyone who just wants NSA sex). So, uh, how does one get started with those? I've tried googling around a bit, but I've found contradictory advice, so I thought I'd ask you guys.

(And yeah, I've thought of just trying them all and seeing how things go, but I find social media distracting enough as is, so I'd like to at least try to wade into things with a more narrow focus, at least to start.)

Second, any tips on how to set up my profile and such? There're always going to be the dudes that don't look beyond the photo, but there's gotta be ways to at least *somewhat* advertise to the right subset ...right?

As far as what I'm looking for, someone in the same age range as me, similar nerdy interests, and a slim or average body type (though I'm really not all *that* picky). (Well, OK, I have a thing for athletic dudes, but I'm well aware that it's not really worthwhile keeping my focus there.)

&lt;p&gt;So... where do you guys think I should begin?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Also, before you all say &amp;quot;screw the apps, get out in the real world more!&amp;quot;, I&amp;#39;m going to be doing that as well.)&lt;/p&gt;

I'm 22 and my best friend is 23. We are both ""straight"" (im bi I think, but he doesnt know), and we have been experimenting lately. We watch porn and jerk each other off, which is certainly not unheard of for straight men, but which generally occurs in the early teens if im not mistaken. More recently, we decided to give each other a blowjob (this hasnt happened yet). I have never heard of straight guys blowing each other to begin with, but it gets weirder. We decided to ""educate ourselves"" by skyping and watching gay porn together while we watch each other jerk off. We have done this twice, and after the first time he said it made him feel uncomfortable and that he didnt want to do it again. A few days after this comment, he says he wants to skype again and starts talking about how horny he is and how he will probably get off while we skype. It obviously happens again, after which he says that's the last time and he was just super horny again. I basically called him out and asked him what was going on, and he replied that he like masturbating solo more than with me, but that he was horny that night. He still wants to be involved in a 69 with me.

I guess my question is this- Im pretty sure I have feelings for him, and I can't tell if he has feelings for me. We are going to blow each other, we watched gay porn together while watching each other masturbate, we came together. Neither of us has had a GF, and he has only had sex when he was intoxicated. Furthermore I know for a fact that he has used grindr in the past (because he was ""super horny"" again...) in order to get head from men. 

Am I reading too deeply into this, or is it something we should discuss? After we blow each other, I had planned on asking him where we stand, saying that we should probably discuss our sexuality. I want to say something along the lines of ""I think I know what you're going through because I'm going through the same thing. I think it would be really beneficial for us if we talked through this and tried to help each other"". At the same time, I dont want to make things weird between us- he's my best friend! 

With the little info I have given you- do you think that my plans are reasonable? Is it normal for straight guys to make these in depth plans weeks in advance to give each other oral, to research the best techniques through watching gay porn? And, most importantly in my mind, is there anything that i can do or say to make him comfortable enough to possibly confide in me as to his sexuality (if he is indeed queer). Would it help if I told him I was bi and then suggested that he might be too? I have tried laying groundwork by asking him what this blowjob means to him (he responded it was just getting off).

Thank you all so much, this has been weighing on my mind lately.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello Reddit, I have a bit of a predicament.

Growing up, I discovered and eventually embraced my sexuality at a pretty young age. When I was around 12 my parents got divorced and both of them had to work, so after school I would be sent over to my 16 year old neighbors house where we would play halo and he'd help me with homework until someone picked me up. For the most part I acted like a normal kid. But there were a few moments that I have always been really ashamed of, and it's been weighing pretty heavily on me lately. 

- I stole his underwear. All the time. I even made sure it was dirty. I loved the smell of his dried pre-cum. I would sometimes even put it on and wear it home, then bring it back the next day and put it under his bed so he wouldn't be suspicious. I also stole his stick of deodorant and a comb.

- Another gross one. But at the time he was sexually active with his girlfriend, and I would actually take his dry used condoms that I found in the trash, and bring them home too.

- Here's the one I'm most ashamed of, and it's because it's more a break of trust than something unhygienic. He used to let me play these strategic type games on his computer, and one time I noticed his girlfriend had off loaded pictures from her phone into a desktop folder, and the next day I brought a digital camera and took pictures of his nudes.

So, basically, I'm wondering if stuff like this made me some kind of depraved child, or if some of you guys had done anything similar.

I've been going to gym and trying to eat better to be more healthy. I know that my body type won't be of a twink ever, I will probably be stocky no matter how much I work out, but I am trying to shave off lots of kg acquired as a result of depression through almost the last ten years. I've had relationships before and I've never given too much thought about them. But I'm not so comfortable with intimacy. And I really don't understand what a 19 year old very fit jock type guy sees in me. Or a 27 year old successful fit guy also sees in me. I've downloaded growler the app and people say I'm a cub. I dunno if that fits. I am a bit hairy. But lots of guys labeled themselves as chasers have approached me and want to hang out. We exchange pics we chat and they all fill me with compliments. There are currently 4 I am talking with and they all want to meet and have something casual. I want it too but I'm afraid that when they see how actually not in shape I am they will back out. I've tried to send the most truthful pics possible but they still feel attracted to me. I'm starting to come to terms with it and enjoy. It just doesn't feel fair for a guy like me that clearly let go of himself to be having fun with these dudes that go gym and have great bodies. And I dunno. My dick is average. Some of them are tops that want ""to fuck my big ass"" and others are only bottoms. Is that how it works? What can you guys tell me about yourselves as chasers? What do you like in a guy, what attracts you about big guys instead of the standard fit dude you're probably part of? I am also afraid that now I'm finally seeing a therapist, a nutritionist and been going gym with a personal trainer to take better care of myself, that I will be invested in a relationship like this and then I'll be dumped cos I'm not big anymore. Most of the guys I'm talking now I don't feel especially attracted beyond something casual, but the 19 years old guy is so cool and we share lot of the same interests I feel there could be something long lasting there. Hope I haven't felt about anyone else in a while. I think that when chasers want guys they want it to be like in this pic, not like I am in real life. http://40.media.tumblr.com/3689458605f3ad1dd2183d758fcdbd11/tumblr_nglg4zgfWl1tm8n6bo1_500.jpg

It just doesn&amp;#39;t feel fair for a guy like me that clearly let go of himself to be having fun with these dudes that go gym and have great bodies. And I dunno. My dick is average. Some of them are tops that want &amp;quot;to fuck my big ass&amp;quot; and others are only bottoms. Is that how it works? What can you guys tell me about yourselves as chasers? What do you like in a guy, what attracts you about big guys instead of the standard fit dude you&amp;#39;re probably part of? I am also afraid that now I&amp;#39;m finally seeing a therapist, a nutritionist and been going gym with a personal trainer to take better care of myself, that I will be invested in a relationship like this and then I&amp;#39;ll be dumped cos I&amp;#39;m not big anymore. Most of the guys I&amp;#39;m talking now I don&amp;#39;t feel especially attracted beyond something casual, but the 19 years old guy is so cool and we share lot of the same interests I feel there could be something long lasting there. Hope I haven&amp;#39;t felt about anyone else in a while. I think that when chasers want guys they want it to be like in this pic, not like I am in real life. &lt;a href=""http://40.media.tumblr.com/3689458605f3ad1dd2183d758fcdbd11/tumblr_nglg4zgfWl1tm8n6bo1_500.jpg""&gt;http://40.media.tumblr.com/3689458605f3ad1dd2183d758fcdbd11/tumblr_nglg4zgfWl1tm8n6bo1_500.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*hey, this was written up by my cousin that has been going through this. He asked me for an opinion and I suggested we posted here, but he didn&amp;#39;t want to create an account and asked if I could post it for him. He poured his heart out and we will be very grateful if you can share whatever experience you have in that subject with us. Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: massive cock up here. I&amp;#39;m 25, not 15. I typed this on the phone and one is just next to two. So sorry.&lt;/p&gt;

Generally, dialogue on any shows/movies I watch seem to be whisper quiet, while the background noises and sound effects seem to be way amplified.

_____________________________________________________________

So after breaking up a few months ago [over working out](http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/2cexxl/would_you_get_upset_if_your_so_went_to_the_gym/), Ive made it a point to express my current fitness goals with potential boyfriends so they at least get an idea. Nothing crazy, but I point out that if something happens or comes up, its not uncommon for me to go to the gym past 11pm, my goal is to get bigger, and that I try to go 4-6 days a week. Well i got lucky and recently met this great guy about a month ago. We hit if off great, starting things off slow, have the same geeky interest, ect. Its not without its problems but the outlook is good. 

Recently we had a discussion about our fitness goals a little more deeply. He's a bit on the hefty side and has been slimming down. His goal is to be toned. I, on the other had want to bulk up. I want to see how big I can get. Here is where things get a bit screwy. He said if I get too muscular everything ends right there. Like he will wake up, decide I'm too big, and end the relationship. He said it like there was nothing wrong or controversial about what came out of his mouth. 

* Veins are a no no. I told him its inevitable a few veins show up. Either by genetics, tone, or some other reason. If I get bigger and toned, some veins will show. Again, unnatural and gross to him. Even if my genetics had given me a big throbbing artery crossing my chest. Nope, still unnatural to him. 

* He wants to get toned to the point where he would have veins popping out by virtue of low body fat. My obvious counter augment is his point made above. Which he then ignores and goes ""thats not the same"" like a 5 year old.

* He thinks that a lot of muscular guys are ""disproportionate"". Granted steroid use plays a part for some, the V shape large guys get is unnatural to him.  I showed him pictures of guys with the body i want to obtain, making sure they have proportionate development. Yet still he says it's unnatural. Again, he shows me his goal body and its the same thing. Thinner, leaner V shaped men. Think fitness models.  At this point the argument is cyclical. 

* He has an issue with dominance in the relationship. Getting bigger than him (he's still taller) somehow screws with that. He only accepts my current size since he's still larger than me. Even if its because of a high body fat %. 

He has this weird perception of what a normal muscular body is. Im willing to respect someone telling me muscle is not their thing, or that Im too big for them. Or they don't agree with dietary supplements and don't want to day someone using ""drugs"".  Its another so say ""You can get muscular, but not this type of muscular. Unless you fall into my narrow and contradicting perception of a normal muscular body, its over, no matter how long we've been going out. I love you, but get to big and Ill drop you like a rock."" It just baffles me.  

Thoughts?

Edit: To avoid confusion. The time I spend in the gym isn't the issue this time around. The link was mostly for context. This current guy comes with me occasionally. He's more worried about the end goal. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;tl;dr:  Discussed fitness goals with new BF.
