We dated for about 8 months or so. He's really one of the best people I've ever met. Silly. Funny. He has a passion for life and art. The only downside is that I felt like he never really had time for me. Like I was fit into the parts of his schedule that weren't taken up by something else.

For example, he could never really come over on weekdays because he was afraid that it would screw him up for work the next morning. Sundays was dance practice, and if we would do something after his practice, he would sometimes bail and go home to sleep.

We want to live together, but he's not even entertaining the idea until at least a year after we graduate.

His dad doesn't let him visit (I think he suspects us. My boyfriend is out to everyone but him, but he's not an idiot), and I don't have my car, which means I can't visit regularly until at least next September.

Because of this, we can't have a real relationship until next summer, otherwise it's just us waiting for months until the next break.

I don't know how to do this though... I've thought about why so much, and how much I don't want to do this, but I don't know what I'm supposed to do... this will be the first real, non-confrontational break-up I've ever been in, and I'm dreading it to the point that I'm not sure if I'll even be able to do it...

He's a chill and friendly guy, but, because I haven't known he's gay, I haven't made a move all semester. Now I'm trying to get a bit closer, and I've started chatting with him before/after class, but the semester's coming to a close, and I likely won't see him next. I don't have the time to take it slow.

I know I need to make a move, but I can't seem to find a good opportunity to ask him out. When he's not in class, he's mostly with one of his friends, so I don't feel comfortable walking up and asking him out between classes. In class is the same issue. 

So I'm considering asking him out over facebook, but I feel like that's awkward and juvenile. I would prefer asking him out face-to-face, but, since I only see him twice a week, if no good opportunity presents itself, I basically have to wait an entire week to try again, which, aside from being frustrating, will make it even more awkward if/when I actually ask him out, since he'll just wonder why I never asked him out sooner.

So I need to find a solution which balances all the awkward factors and optimizes my chances of not coming off as weird / desperate / creepy. Suggestions?

He'll go silent for hours and hours, even if he initiated the conversation. But he will initiate now and then. So I can't tell if he's not interested, talks to me when he's bored, or what??? Is he just trying to feel me out?

He will type things like "" I hope we can hangout soon"" or ""We'll just play it by ear,"" -- but I've invited him to a few neutral things and he's always had a reason to say no. I don't want to be annoying, and I don't really like giving up.   Basically I'm someone who over thinks everything and I'm slightly robotic, so dating stuff stresses me out.

I went on a date with someone through okcupid, and I wasn't really that interested, but he was nice and we shared lots of interests, so I agreed to a date. He texted me quite a lot beforehand (initiating 2-3 conversations each day including good morning, good night, etc), which I found off-putting, but still, he was a nice person. 

The date lasted 3 hours, and we started talking over coffee and discussed our similar interests (music production), and then he asked if I would want to smoke a joint. Of course, I said yes. I now realize that this was a mistake. If I were genuinely interested in him romantically, I may have suggested waiting a couple of dates. 

My tolerance is quite low at the moment since I'm searching for a job, and post-grad life does not afford the same level of being permanently stoned. I got quite high and was in an unfamiliar environment with a kid I had just met. Needless to say, I was a little loopy. I DID enjoy hanging with him and we had plenty to talk about (like how that apartment building over there totally just looked like a gothic cathedral for a sec. Totally.)

However, I knew I wasn't into it romantically, and I had to end the date just as he suggested going to get some food (quite ungracefully mind you). As he said goodbye, he spoke of seeing each other again, and went in for the kiss. I stood ridden with anxiety unable to properly communicate what I needed to. As he approached, my hands remained in my pockets, and I stared blankly as he aborted the kiss for a painfully awkward peck on the cheek. He then froze up and awkwardly apologized and was clearly embarrassed (if that were me, I would also be somewhat hurt). I told him ""Dude, don't worry about it, you're fine"".  

Normal ""good time"" texts were exchanged afterwards. I don't want to go on another date, but there is no doubt we hit it off to a certain degree. He's the kind of guy I could see being friends with in college. I'm feeling a bit guilty about the way I handled the situation: being too high to communicate clearly, making him feel embarrassed, and perhaps not letting onto the fact that I wasn't interested. 

This happens a lot. I meet a guy I totally like, but I tend not to be sexually or romantically attracted to guys that are *just like me*. I have gone on a couple of very long, pretty enjoyable dates that end with the other guy being confused or annoyed when he finds out I'm not interested. In this case, a friendship is unlikely (he's in school, I'm not. I live about 25 minutes from the city, and it's not a casual friendship. It would feel forced). 

I feel badly. I feel a bit guilty. I'm not sure what to say to this guy. It's been a couple of days with no word, so I'm sure I could just let it fade, but I don't want him to think he did anything wrong or have him be hard on himself (I know speculation runs wild when I get rejected). Do I tell him I had a great time, he's friendship material, but I'm not interested, or do I allow him to deal with it on his own and not contact him (since he's taken the cue and stopped contacting me)?. If I weren't so blazed, I would have said something more concrete and clear in person. I just feel like a bit of an asshole. 

     ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, I ask this with the context of having met someone (for the first time) on a coffee date. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went on a date with someone through okcupid, and I wasn&amp;#39;t really that interested, but he was nice and we shared lots of interests, so I agreed to a date. He texted me quite a lot beforehand (initiating 2-3 conversations each day including good morning, good night, etc), which I found off-putting, but still, he was a nice person. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The date lasted 3 hours, and we started talking over coffee and discussed our similar interests (music production), and then he asked if I would want to smoke a joint. Of course, I said yes. I now realize that this was a mistake. If I were genuinely interested in him romantically, I may have suggested waiting a couple of dates. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My tolerance is quite low at the moment since I&amp;#39;m searching for a job, and post-grad life does not afford the same level of being permanently stoned. I got quite high and was in an unfamiliar environment with a kid I had just met. Needless to say, I was a little loopy. I DID enjoy hanging with him and we had plenty to talk about (like how that apartment building over there totally just looked like a gothic cathedral for a sec. Totally.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I knew I wasn&amp;#39;t into it romantically, and I had to end the date just as he suggested going to get some food (quite ungracefully mind you). As he said goodbye, he spoke of seeing each other again, and went in for the kiss. I stood ridden with anxiety unable to properly communicate what I needed to. As he approached, my hands remained in my pockets, and I stared blankly as he aborted the kiss for a painfully awkward peck on the cheek. He then froze up and awkwardly apologized and was clearly embarrassed (if that were me, I would also be somewhat hurt). I told him &amp;quot;Dude, don&amp;#39;t worry about it, you&amp;#39;re fine&amp;quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normal &amp;quot;good time&amp;quot; texts were exchanged afterwards. I don&amp;#39;t want to go on another date, but there is no doubt we hit it off to a certain degree. He&amp;#39;s the kind of guy I could see being friends with in college. I&amp;#39;m feeling a bit guilty about the way I handled the situation: being too high to communicate clearly, making him feel embarrassed, and perhaps not letting onto the fact that I wasn&amp;#39;t interested. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This happens a lot. I meet a guy I totally like, but I tend not to be sexually or romantically attracted to guys that are &lt;em&gt;just like me&lt;/em&gt;. I have gone on a couple of very long, pretty enjoyable dates that end with the other guy being confused or annoyed when he finds out I&amp;#39;m not interested. In this case, a friendship is unlikely (he&amp;#39;s in school, I&amp;#39;m not. I live about 25 minutes from the city, and it&amp;#39;s not a casual friendship. It would feel forced). &lt;/p&gt;

I posted a similar thread about my frustration over guys not wanting to actually talk, but dependent on texting and Facebook or whatever.
I'm a 24 year old, I didn't get a home computer till I moved out at 20 and I had a tracphone with 100 minutes and 100 texts per month, I got my iphone earlier this year and I like that i never get lost anymore and have to up to date news about stuff. But, I feel like I'm becoming one of those people who are always looking at a phone instead of going through life and I miss the feeling of going out and not being able to be contacted by people, and I need constant access to information instead of just reading a book or a news paper. I'm considering just pawning the phone and getting another tracfone for emergencies. I have a desktop at home so i won't be internetless. Also, pay $10 per month for the phone plus whatever for DSL mis a lot more appealing than $250 bucks for wifi iphone data.

My question is, would a guy without a cellphone (the tracfone would be for emergencies only has 100 minutes and no extra texting plan) be a no-no for you?
