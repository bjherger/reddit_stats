I work full time to pay the bills and go to school part time. I've always been one to avoid debt when possible and I've been lucky enough so far to pay what a grant doesn't cover out of pocket. Because of work, I can only take a few classes a semester and my graduation date is moving further and further away. Lately I've been feeling pretty down about how long it's going to take to graduate and I've been thinking of quitting my job, going to school full time and living off loans. If I do this, I'll be cutting my time to graduate in half, but I'll be racking up a good chunk of debt (around 20k). I'll be going into a career with good employment rates and a good starting salary, so I should be able to pay my loans back pretty fast. But the idea of owing so much money is scary when I've never owed more than a few hundred bucks. 
So, what would you guys do; Continue the extremely long process of school debt free while working a shitty job, or quit your job and finish school much faster with student loans to pay back?
And if you don't mind answering: how much money have you guys racked up in school? And how hopeful are you of paying them back?

All my friends are straight. They are awesome, but I always end up a bit sexually frustrated since no amount of getting to know or building a friend relationship better leads to anything more. I've learnt to move past any specific crushes, but just the general feeling of always hanging around straight people makes me frustrated.

I've never had many friends, always been a bit of a loner, and I'm pretty socially awkward. I've gotten a lot better since high school, but still face anxiety slightly from me feeling like everything social is forced for me unless I'm around my closest friends.

I broke up with my girlfriend of 4 years when I came out, and that was a HUGE chunk out of my happiness and confidence losing her. I'm still quite depressed losing someone that fulfilled so much emotionally for me.

I've been told I should work on myself before looking to date or anything serious. I've been told to do things I love and everything else will fall into place.

The thing is, when I do things I love all the time, I just get surrounded by more and more straight people, and just become really good friends with more straight people, which just makes me frustrated again.

All my hobbies, interests, etc. are pretty much solo things, and the things that aren't are pretty masculine or gender neutral, and I've never meet any gay guys I've noticed there. And I can't advertise I'm gay.

I'd really like to meet some gay friends, but I just can't find any doing what I do now.

Any gay specific event, club, etc. has little interest to me, as sexuality specific things don't interest me a lot. Perhaps I have just been going to the wrong places?

Going to new places is scary as I would go alone, I'd have to bug a friend to go with me, which just makes me feel shitty they don't want to be there (or maybe its OK for me to push them to go with me?).

I live in Vancouver, which I'm told is very gay friendly, but yet I'm having such a hard time.

I guess my whole life up to now has been shaped in a very specific way, and it really isn't working for my sexuality right now.

In college I was a bit of a slut, by my own admittance. Had some bad things go down but I'll skip the sob-story for this. My BF and I have been together for a little over a year now. We've had sex multiple times by now of course but I always have the feeling that my hole looks too used for him. Out of all the times he's topped me, he's only cum once while doing so. I'm too shy/non-confrontational to ask him if my hole looks gross. 

I'll look at myself in the mirror and if I was about to fuck my hole, I'd be a little apprehensive, but I'm my worst critic. I'll look at porn of similar guys my age and their holes are smooth (not meaning hair) and tight, while its sexy as hell, I always feel a little discouraged. I've had an anal fissure that tends to bleed sometimes, and it's a little lumpy. 

Is there an appropriate /r/ to post a pic or two of my hole for honest criticism or someone to just help me in general. I need to know if I'm all used up or if I'm just being too critical of myself. 

**TL;DR** Worried that my hole looks too gnarly for the bf, would like someone to tell me the truth. Willing to share pics.

I've been dating a guy for over 3 months, and lately I've noticed that I've been to one who's been doing the chasing. It kinda makes me seem needy. It's this exact thing that destroyed my last relationship.

I know that if I stop what I do (for example, I'd text good morning and good night to him every day), then he may think that I'm not interested anymore. And that's not what I want to happen.

What are some tips to be the one who is chased?

Thank you.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I feel like if I play hard to get then I&amp;#39;ll just come off as not interested.&lt;/p&gt;

I hate the obsession over sex (much more than straight guys) mainly. I feel like a prude in comparison to most gay men, but I feel normal when I'm with work colleagues and friends. But then if I was to say that I felt gay activities were abnormal I'd be called a self hating homophobe.

I have had gay mates who I get along with really well, but the more they indulge in the gay community the more I feel estranged from them. 

I feel like when I try to connect with other gay guys (for friends, sex, or romance) it feels a little seedy or forced. Like Growlr or Grindr. You try to connect with other gay men with the sole focus on sexuality and it can get a bit weird.

I about as proud as my sexuality as a straight man would be, i.e. neutral. It just defines who and what I find attractive, but the behavioural stuff I feel like I connect better with straight people. Manchester Gay Pride is always on my birthday and I avoid it like the plague. I find it so full on. All I want is a nice chubby guy to share my life with and have a laugh.

And I don't blame anybody but myself for feeling like this. It isn't anybody elses problem or fault but my own. My question is does (has) anybody else felt like this, and if so what did you do, if anything.

Sorry for the ramblings and uncoordinated text, I've felt especially pissed off about it today.
