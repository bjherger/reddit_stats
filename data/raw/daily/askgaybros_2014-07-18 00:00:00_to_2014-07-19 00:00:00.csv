I'm a rising sophomore (19) studying in the States, came out earlier this year, openly gay. My school's pretty liberal and my friends (both on campus and back at home) were all extremely supportive and accepting.

The problem is that my parents don't know, and I have no idea when or how to tell them. They're Chinese-Canadian, raised on the mainland—and we know how patriarchal and traditional *that* culture is. Neither is particularly accepting of gays, which they associate with effeminacy. Doesn't help that I've never been particularly macho (though hardly Liberace) and have started being more particular about my appearance. 

They constantly pester me about not having a girlfriend, and I simply tell them I don't have time for one (4.0s before hos... ha). I'm planning on pursuing romance next semester, which shouldn't be difficult to conceal from them because I'm in another country. Thing is, I'm not sure how long they'll accept the ""SORRY TOO BUSY READING BOOKS NO TIME FOR BOOBS"" excuse. My mother is already sending me clips of Chinese dating videos to ""help with getting girls""—pretty sure they're suspicious about my being gay, especially since back when I was 14 they found my porn. 

I've thought about telling them when I graduate, but I'm not sure they'll buy it for that long. No idea how they'll react, either. What should I do? Should I grow a (metaphorical) beard?

What are some easy ways to keep fit while travelling? Has any one had any experience with this. Preferably things that are free.

Usually walking or cycling for around 4 hours a day but doesn't seem to be doing enough.

TL;DR: Travelling and want to stay fit, how?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently I&amp;#39;ve decided to get fit and have been going pretty well so far (lost around 5kg already) and want to keep up the momentum. I&amp;#39;ve just started an eight month trip in Southern Europe (France, Spain and Portugal) and after a week I&amp;#39;m starting to feel like I&amp;#39;m putting on a bit more weight from the Backpackers lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;

There are a lot of issues to tackle here confidence in your appearance being the simplest one. 
                                                   
Just as a little background I am an Anglo-Caribbean male who lives in the south east of England in a prominent white area where racism is far from unheard of. And to top it all I am the only person of colour in my family as my Father died when I was young and his side of the family does no reside in England. When I was younger I always had trouble convincing myself that I could be as stylish as or I could be as attractive as a white guy. Whenever someone didn't find me attractive I would always attribute this down to my colour or the features that come with it and it became impossible for me to convince myself otherwise completely decimating my confidence. 

Some guys will have different tastes in men but this does not mean that you are inadequate compared to a white person and this most certainly does not mean you can't be so much more that what others or even you believe you can be. you need to stop trying to be as attractive as or as stylish as X and understand that you can be so unique and such an individual if you are proud of your race and you make the most of it. I have found that the world is far more interesting place the further from the norm you are through my years of hardship I have met so many amazing people that have liked and loved me both as a person and as a person of colour.  

This is by far the hardest thing I have every had to write as it is such a hard issue to tackle but I hope I have inspired some confidence in you guys.

Edit: Changed the wording to give a bit more clarity :P 

It would have been lovely if people had instead of trying to pick holes in my arguments tried to maybe help our fellow gaybros in accepting themselves but balls to that hey.

We took his big Husky for a walk around downtown where he lives at 2a.m. and really felt like a couple. No touching, no kissing, no sex; just fun times until he fell asleep beside me watching Orange Is The New Black at 4a.m. I could get used to that. 

Well his friend is getting married this weekend and he hinted at making me his plus one. I really want to say let's do it, but I don't know if that would be moving too fast? Any advice?
