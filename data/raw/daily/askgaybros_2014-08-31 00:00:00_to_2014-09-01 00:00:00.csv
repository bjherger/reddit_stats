Right now i think with everything on it it gets up close to 200lb. It comes with dumbbell things too.

So if i were to do 3 sets of 10 pushups, and 3 sets of 8 or 10 bench press. Would that count for a full chest workout for one day?

What would i do for legs? Just squats? 3 sets of 10 for that too?

What about toning my belly/torso area? What would i do to lose a bit of fat and get muscle there. 

I want to get fit and finally start using this thing, i got it a few years ago with my birthday money and i never used it since, i just don't know where to start or if i should have some workout schedule thing.
