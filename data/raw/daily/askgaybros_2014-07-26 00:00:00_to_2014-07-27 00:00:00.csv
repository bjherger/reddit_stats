Whilst I almost always use condoms whilst having sex, I have previously barebacked with ex-partners. 

However, never have I let anyone cum in me when having unprotected sex. The thought of letting someone ejaculate inside me is a real turn-off and I think I have conditioned myself to think like this to help minimise the risk of catching diseases, especially HIV. 

In my head I (naively) assume that people who have caught HIV etc. must have had really messy cummy anal sex. 

My question is, when having unprotected sex (if you do it), is it common for you to ejaculate or be ejaculated into? Or do you never allow it?

I'm 21 and I've known I'm bi for probably 3 years now, and I've been acting on it for probably a year and a half, but in all that time I've never given anyone a sign that I wasn't as straight as they thought. And in all honesty never thought I would tell anyone because I didn't see myself getting serious with a guy, but I ended up meeting an awesome guy and have been dating him since February.

In that time I haven't seen my best friend a whole lot because he was dating a super controlling jealous succubus. They broke up last weekend and he wants to go out and get crazy this weekend like we used to, like getting wasted and picking up chicks (he has even joked, I think, about us having a MFM threesome, which has been kind of a running joke). 

Edit: Guess it's not happening tonight, just as I had resolved to do it. He's decided to stay in tonight so we are just going to play Titanfall with each other online. I suppose I could still do it, but it would be over Xbox live, not sure if I should now or wait 

He is also always determined to find me a girl and it's always bothered him more than me when I'm single for extended periods of time. Some of those times I'm actually completely single, other times I have been fooling around with people, my friend just has no idea. So tonight when he inevitably starts talking about finding me someone I think I'm going to tell him, but I have a few things holding me back:

1. The added complications of being bi instead of gay, I don't want him to now discount my previous relationships as fake or half-hearted. And I dread the typical ""why don't you just choose women"" comment 

2. I'm going out with him and a bunch of his (American-style)football buddies that I've since become friends with, all super bro cliches, and if I tell him at the beginning of the night it could get super weird

3. While I don't really see him freaking out or being homophobic, there's always a chance, especially because I live in the Kansas of Canada (Saskatchewan). But I've never seen him be homophobic, only when he jokingly calls me gay or says something or someone is being gay (I'm guilty of this too) 

4. And this is my main one, we've seen each other naked a fair bit over the years and there's been the typical stupid homoerotic locker-room goofing around stuff that happens (especially when we shared hotel rooms on our senior Europe trip) I don't want him reading anything into any of those previous interactions and being weirded out because there was nothing sexual about it for me and for the most part, I didn't even know I was bi at that point.

Basically I want to know how I should go about this, do I just put it out there at the beginning of the night when I pick him up to go bar hoping, do I wait till the topic comes up? All I really know is I plan on saying it very matter of factly, I just fear it will get weird. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeah I know, another one of these&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m 21 and I&amp;#39;ve known I&amp;#39;m bi for probably 3 years now, and I&amp;#39;ve been acting on it for probably a year and a half, but in all that time I&amp;#39;ve never given anyone a sign that I wasn&amp;#39;t as straight as they thought. And in all honesty never thought I would tell anyone because I didn&amp;#39;t see myself getting serious with a guy, but I ended up meeting an awesome guy and have been dating him since February.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that time I haven&amp;#39;t seen my best friend a whole lot because he was dating a super controlling jealous succubus. They broke up last weekend and he wants to go out and get crazy this weekend like we used to, like getting wasted and picking up chicks (he has even joked, I think, about us having a MFM threesome, which has been kind of a running joke). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Guess it&amp;#39;s not happening tonight, just as I had resolved to do it. He&amp;#39;s decided to stay in tonight so we are just going to play Titanfall with each other online. I suppose I could still do it, but it would be over Xbox live, not sure if I should now or wait &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is also always determined to find me a girl and it&amp;#39;s always bothered him more than me when I&amp;#39;m single for extended periods of time. Some of those times I&amp;#39;m actually completely single, other times I have been fooling around with people, my friend just has no idea. So tonight when he inevitably starts talking about finding me someone I think I&amp;#39;m going to tell him, but I have a few things holding me back:&lt;/p&gt;

After nearly 3 years of depression I've become what I always hated and feared becoming the most- A complete, unemployable loser with no future.  I turned 30 only a couple of months ago and at this point my health, mental state, and finances are all in a complete state of destitution.  I've lost and alienated all my friends due to me being to ashamed to face them, and I'm stuck living on the couch of my loving, but hyper-religous and homophobic family.  I've had a lot of bad breaks in a life that can be best described as a living nightmare, but fuck that- I've taken accountability that regardless of circumstances it's still *my* life and I could have made a lot of better choices or fought a bit harder to not get to this point.

I've accepted this, and I'm trying to move on and turn things around, but It ultimately feels so hopeless.  I know it's wrong, but I think about dieing all the time, and how it would finally be such a relief.  I go to bed hoping that I'll not wake up again the next morning so that it will all finally be over.  I'm still trying to turn things around though.  I've taken steps to improve my physical health and diet in hopes of it jump-starting a more positive outlook, but so far it's been slow.  I get up every morning at 5:30 and walk/jog for 30-60 minutes, but can't do much more than that due to a lack of energy from a combination of a genetic illness that affects my muscles, and the 50 pounds I've put on over the last few years.  I can't lift the way I used to, so it's a slow process, and It doesn't help feeling all the time like my existence and worth as an individual is worthless and would be better off dead, but I'm still trying.

The worst part of it all is the realization that I've fucked things up so much that I'll be alone for the rest of my life now.  It hurts and feels like my chest is collapsing in on itself at times.  I wasn't exactly a catch before hand, nor have I ever been considered attractive, and my education never extended past a couple of semesters at a community college, but at least I had a unimpressive but decent enough job that payed ok, lived on my own, and had a good social life, dated occasionally and at least had *something* to offer a potential mate.  Now I have absolutely fucking nothing to offer and I don't see that aspect of me changing anytime soon.  I know it's going to take me years to claw my way out of this deep hole, but in the end I'll probably be just some lonely, ugly old schlub eking out a pathetic existence.

I'm not scared or terrified of the fact that I'll probably have a shitty life from this point forward, it's the fact that I'll be alone with no one to love or be loved back by.  That train of thought keeps me up at night sometimes and honestly, is more scary than the constant thoughts of death.  I don't care about sex- it feels empty unfulfilling for me with random people anyways.  I do however miss the intimacy and bond of a relationship with someone you have genuine feelings for.  Things like holding hands, spending time together, kissing, holding each other, waking up next to each other- I can't express in words how much I miss and long to experience things like that again.

So I guess the ""Ask"" part of this long rambling whinefest, how do I cope with the knowledge that I'm more than likely going to live out the rest of my time on this planet alone?  I can live with the fact that i'm a failure and a loser, It's a struggle but I can live with my health problems, and it's going to suck but I know I'll probably be poor and living paycheck to paycheck the rest of my life- but god fucking damnit I'm not sure I can bare all that *in addition* to not being worthy enough of finding someone to spend the rest of my (pathetic) life with.

Transferring to a new college this fall, where I will be living in a Scholarship House (think frat house for geeks). Planning on being open about my sexuality, but I'm not sure how to tell my roommate.

My last roommate found out when I decided to bring a guy back to the room to spend the night. (Hindsight this could have gone disastrously, but he took it in stride.)

Just really nervous. Most people don't know I'm gay when they meet me (and half think I'm joking when they find out). Don't want to come on to strong. Ecstatic for a new school and don't wanna fuck this up.
