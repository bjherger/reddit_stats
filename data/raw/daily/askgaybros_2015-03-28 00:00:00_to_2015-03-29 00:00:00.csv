I find OKCupid fascinating in a sense that I'm in a bigger city, there're tons of guys, but none of them really want to talk or do anything. They kind of just ""exist"". Even in the rare situation where someone messages me first, I have to put up the extra effort to keep the contact going, bring up the possibility of a date, arranging a date, etc.

So, bros... does this seem typical for you? It really feels bizarre that these dating sites will have so many people on them that are looking for a relationship, but won't actually reach out to anybody or respond to those that reach out to them.

The shallow side of me wanted to chalk this up to physical attraction. Maybe they looked at my profile, saw me, and weren't interested. Still, out of the thirty-or-so people I've contacted, this is a bit *too* consistent.

What's your take?

I’ve been reading the posts here for a month now and you guys are really great. I want some input on me. (Sorry in advance for any language errors, 2nd language.)

I’m 21 years old. I’m currently living abroad and now staying with my brother rent free for a while. I would say that I’m average looking and average built.


I haven’t really got any experience with dating, as it usually ends after one meeting, even though conversation is flowing and we’re having fun. 
 It never seems to continue, I’ve tried the apps and all that stuff. But now I’ve deleted them all.

 It seems that I’m stuck in the Siri conversation. I initiate a conversation, there is a reply. Nothing more. No one initiates my way. Which is why I have given up on the whole thing.

I’ve been stood up and friends forgetting plans with me so many times that I now have a sixth sense about it. Since I knew I was forgettable I didn’t really think over it much. But a week ago I was sick and stayed in bed some days. It gave me some time to think, and now I feel like shit.

I’m a good guy, I put everyones needs ahead of mine, putting a smile on someones face makes me happy. I'm selfless and always shares. 
It has always been a fundamental thing in my personality, and I’m not sure if its something I’m willing to let go off.
A friend of mine said that I have the personality that people like when they are 35 and are ready to settle down.

So I've become stuck in this bad circle. I have never had sex, just fooling around and giving bjs, and only 5 times. I’m not comfortable with meeting someone with the only purpose being sex. 

I want to know if anyone has been in the same position and have any tips. I’ll answer any question :)

This is probably a silly question (for more silly posts and comments inspect my history) but it's bugging my mind anyway. I'm 17 now and I will start University this fall. I got the chance to go to one of the best Universities in Europe because I apparently live in the accommodating suburb and my parents are providing me the free housing. I'm somewhat grateful for all this, but then again it makes me think. It's a different culture maybe but looking at US colleges I see 85% of people describing as a really fun opportunity. Especially because you house around equally old people.
I wonder how you guys would go about dating if you were me. Please don't tell me I can't have a boyfriend because I need to study all the time, it's not like I'm not going to take this serious but I'm neither a 24/7 work machine. If I ever got to know someone (by dating or random occasion) and it turned serious what would I do? Maybe we could go to his place but I swear every hotel/hostel around here is absolutely expensive and this really wouldn't be an option. Then taking him to my home would be so extremely weird (especially since my family hasn't cleared themselves completely from their internalized homophobia) and we couldn't have *that* kind of fun here either because in our home you'd hear about everything.
I would really like to share some of my time and love with a guy and I'm interested in a long-term relationship rather than a hookup but I guess in my current living situation it would only work out with a rich sugar daddy (and I'm not sure how great exactly this would be).
Any opinions on what I could do about this all? Do I just stick to solitude during the next couple years (and also to the years following until I can afford a flat here or move to a cheaper country)?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey Bros!&lt;/p&gt;

I really want to fix things between him and I and have our friendship back. 
Has anyone been in a similar position or be able to give some advice? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: the situation that ended the friendship was he could no longer deal with me pushing him away and always being in a bad mood because of external things going on in my life. I don&amp;#39;t blame him, we are complete opposites. He is very go with the flow and relaxed and I&amp;#39;m high strung and always thinking. I regret so much pushing him away and I want to fix things. &lt;/p&gt;

The breakup happened 5 weeks ago; and im feeling fairly emotionally sound. I want to try hooking up; And i have even courted a guy off craigslist who is interested in FWB.

My question is basically on the emotional rollercoaster of breakups; One day im feeling fantastic and want to have a hookup to get over my EX. And then randomly the next day im a crying mess.

I really really want to try a hookup because i think i can find some liberation; and i know that in the moment; i will probably feel good about myself. 
I have actually attempted dating; and found a guy. But it was only 2 weeks after my break and i was entirely not ready.
So im taking it slower and wanting to try again instead with a hookup; becuase i think the emotional connection side just isnt ready yet.


- My fear is having the hookup; Then the next day the emotional roller coaster of a breakup kicking my ass; making me feel horrible for 'cheating' on my EX.
Is this a rational fear? Should i consider waiting a few more weeks if i fear this is goign to happen?

- or is this just one of those emotional hurdles everyone has to cross at one point; and is it likley goign to give me the liberation im looking for?

But, I left before it started. I went with my best friend and his other group of friends. I don’t really know them or have anything in common with them, and I’m sure they weren’t doing it on purpose, but everyone kept running off to different places while I just stood by myself. Kinda felt like a loser, so I just left… Now my buddy is texting me, asking where I went. I know if I tell him I left he’ll feel like a piece of shit, and I don’t want to ruin his night. He’s really an amazing friend, and he shouldn’t have to turn his life upside down because I have horrible social anxiety… Now I’m sitting in my room, kinda drunk, kinda crying, which is not atypical for my Friday nights… 

Most people would be really surprised this is how I spend my free time. I have my life together in most other respects. I go to a good school, have good grades, can converse with people really well, speak well in front of large groups of people, etc. I just don’t have a core group of friends. Lost one of my closest friends last year when I told him I was gay. Another good friend graduated early. And my only friend left (my best friend mentioned earlier) has another group of friends, much more fun than I am, that’s a bunch a bros. I guess I’m a fairly masculine guy, but I just don’t feel like I fit in with them at all. Just don’t have anything in common with them, don’t exactly talk the way they do, they’re always talking about girls and shit and I have nothing to say about that… Even my best friend will like pat them on the back and stuff like bros, but he doesn’t do that with me. I just feel really alone and shitty. I feel like me being gay is always getting in the way. And I fucking hate myself for being so dramatic. Seriously, I sound like fucking Patrick from Looking, that guy fucking sucks.

I just want to feel the way other people do. I want to have friends and I want to be able to go out and have fun with them. I just don’t want to feel alone anymore.
