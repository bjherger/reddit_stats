He's very understanding and was a major help when I came out to him, while I find him very attractive, I value him greatly as just a friend and I've promised myself to not do anything inappropiate to him. (Also he has a girlfriend and I don't want to ruin anything there)

He ended up sleeping at my place and I found him a thin matress, probably not the most comfortable to sleep on, but after a bit of complaining I teased him to join me in my 1-man bed if he wanted a softer matress. He refuses at first and we keep talking about what's happening in our lives. After some time of talking I actually convince him to come and cuddle with me and we end up falling asleep next to eachother in my single sized bed.

In the morning I wake up as the big spoon and decide to jump under his blanket to keep myself warm. I get comfy and hold tighter to him and get a really nice spooning position. I had no intentions of doing anything else at this point, just to cuddle because I fucking love cuddling, but then he starts to tease me. He starts rubbing his butt on my crotch and I pay no mind, I was thinking he might just be joking because he knows I'm gay. I don't say anything, but get a weird feeling when he still haven't stopped after a while. He keeps rubbing my crotch with his butt and I can feel my boner rising, surely he could too, but apparantly he didn't mind. I still haven't said anything at this point, because it felt good and was still kind of innocent, but it keeps getting more intense. He starts massaging my thigh and works his hand up to my crotch. He grabs my dick through my sweatpants and starts gently stroking it. I'm in shock. I'm caught between enjoying it and being really uncomfortable with my straight friend doing this to me. I don't know if I'm able to say much at this point, or if I even wanted to make it stop. His hand reaches down my pants and grabs my dick and keeps stroking it. I get to my senses and grab his hand to take it away from my dick.

He ends up admitting a bit of bicuriousity to me and I let him know that I'm having a million thoughts in my head right know. We don't discuss it much further and he lets me know that he doesn't really think that much about it.
I'm really conflicted about it though. Should I have stopped him sooner? Does this count as him cheating on his girlfriend? What do I need to tell him about this? - he's probably a bit surprised too I would guess.


TLDR: Spooning with my longtime straight friend, he rubs my crotch with his butt and strokes my dick with his hand, I stop him there. Now I'm comflicted about it, I know he kind of came on to me, but I can't help but feel it's my fault.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I had my long time friend over for a night of gaming and movies, just us 2 having a good time like the comfortable couple of friends we&amp;#39;ve always been.

I'm in my mid-twenties, I came out in Spring this year (religion held me back) and since coming out I've always been intent on having a relationship rather than doing the grindr thing.

Despite this, I have used grindr a few times and I always feel a little bit dirty and used after I do. I realised that I need some kind of emotional connection to be able to have sex with a guy.

I'm signed up to a few dating sites (Tinder/POF) etc and I seem to have no problem converting matches into conversation, then conversation into first dates. The problem I have is I often meet guys that I'd quite like to see again and invariably they want to see me again too. I haven't really had a bad first date. About the second or third date I've had sex with the guy and at this point I start to lose interest. I usually start to see flaws in their character that I can't get over, or I start to become less physically attracted to them. A small part of me starts to feel that maybe I can do better and that I'm just 'settling' for someone who clearly likes me.

My question is - am I the one who's flawed? Is it normal to find someone less physically attractive after you've had sex? Should I settle and accept that everyone has some flaws?

I really want to find 'the one' but I feel like I either have really high standards (I don't think I do), or maybe I'm just not ready to be in a relationship yet.

About a month ago I was talking with a guy on Grindr when we decided we should meet up. We played disc golf, he bought me lunch, and we went to the movies, overall we both enjoyed it. The next two weekends I went to his house where we ate, cuddled while watching movies together, slept together, and then we'd go out and do something the following day.

So after these three, I don't know if ""dates"" is the right word, but dates, I was fairly interested in this guy. About a week goes by and our convos get less frequent. After about a week I texted him pretty much telling him I really enjoyed our get-togethers hoping that I could see if he was still interested or not. He responded that he just wanted to be friends for now but that maybe it could develop into something later.

Fast forward to today, we decided to meet up and we went on a hike together, both of us seemingly had a good time. Then when he dropped me off we kind of awkwardly said bye to each other and that was it.

My question is, if this guy isn't as into me as I am into him, I kind of want to move on and start seeing other guys. On the other hand, I don't want to risk screwing up this potential relationship by seeing other people when he may want to get together in the future. So, am I still ""allowed"" in a sense to go out and see other guys? Or should I wait it out? Its been a little over a month and I'm kind of frustrated because I don't really know where we both stand. I'm also too afraid to ask him about any of this or what he currently thinks because I feel like he might just get rid of the friendship altogether.

Any advice on what I should do? Thanks guys.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alright so here&amp;#39;s my dilemma.&lt;/p&gt;

Over the summer I dealt with a heavily labor intensive job in which I felt in danger every day, my father blatantly telling me how he's going to treat every other sibling of mine better than me (paying for their colleges, cars, ect) simply because I won't turn on my mother (theyre divorced and he doesnt want to pay child support), and an Ex whom I only dated for about a month and a half. He flat out tried to ruin my life. 

My Ex would tell my friends that he was selling himself, slept with 100 people since the breakup and possibly had HIV... THEN he admitted a few days ago that he lied about all of this just to get my friends to hate me. And the scary thing was it was working because a few people started to avoid/stop talking to me. I've gotten apologizes from those people but the fact that his lies worked hurts. He also showed them half-nude pictures of myself. The other day he spent 15 minutes begging/crying at my dorm room door asking to let him in and give him another chance. It all ended when I texted him to either leave me alone or I'd call the cops as he was harassing me and started to scare me.

My Ex admitted to lying and begged for my friends' forgiveness (he was part of my friend group before we started dating) and they all granted it to him. That really hurt that they'd allow him back in after all the fucked up shit he's done to me. And now he's trying to use that text I sent him to garner sympathy again ""He's trying to ruin my reputation!"" or ""He's handling this so immaturely"" I know that my friends now understand he's a liar and don't trust him but I don't like that he's getting a second chance because he's an extremely gifted liar. He may be a stupid asshole, but he's the greatest liar I've ever met. Even when I know he's lying to my face I believe his words. 

After all of this, coming out, having a sister in and out of rehab due to a heroin addiction, and going through my parent's divorce... I feel defeated. I don't like watching movies anymore. I'm always tired. I'm not interested in my classes anymore... I know it's some form of depression but whats scaring me is that I don't feel like myself. I always feel nervous/anxious like there's something I need to do or else something TERRIBLE will happen. Like if I haven't called my dad in a few days I get this horrible throb in my chest and I get all sweaty... I don't even like talking to him. When I'm with my friends I always feel like it's draining and I'm almost always disinterested with 90% of the things they're saying. I also can't even think about guys anymore. If a guy is attractive the most I'll do is give a quick look and just give up. I used to try and strike conversation. I also used to occasionally hookup but now I just can't even bother anymore. The idea of a hookup or date just tires me out. Even masturbation is a chore.

And now he&amp;#39;s trying to use that text I sent him to garner sympathy again &amp;quot;He&amp;#39;s trying to ruin my reputation!&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;He&amp;#39;s handling this so immaturely&amp;quot; I know that my friends now understand he&amp;#39;s a liar and don&amp;#39;t trust him but I don&amp;#39;t like that he&amp;#39;s getting a second chance because he&amp;#39;s an extremely gifted liar. He may be a stupid asshole, but he&amp;#39;s the greatest liar I&amp;#39;ve ever met. Even when I know he&amp;#39;s lying to my face I believe his words. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all of this, coming out, having a sister in and out of rehab due to a heroin addiction, and going through my parent&amp;#39;s divorce... I feel defeated. I don&amp;#39;t like watching movies anymore. I&amp;#39;m always tired. I&amp;#39;m not interested in my classes anymore... I know it&amp;#39;s some form of depression but whats scaring me is that I don&amp;#39;t feel like myself. I always feel nervous/anxious like there&amp;#39;s something I need to do or else something TERRIBLE will happen. Like if I haven&amp;#39;t called my dad in a few days I get this horrible throb in my chest and I get all sweaty... I don&amp;#39;t even like talking to him. When I&amp;#39;m with my friends I always feel like it&amp;#39;s draining and I&amp;#39;m almost always disinterested with 90% of the things they&amp;#39;re saying. I also can&amp;#39;t even think about guys anymore. If a guy is attractive the most I&amp;#39;ll do is give a quick look and just give up. I used to try and strike conversation. I also used to occasionally hookup but now I just can&amp;#39;t even bother anymore. The idea of a hookup or date just tires me out. Even masturbation is a chore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to find myself again but I don&amp;#39;t know how. I hate who I am right now. Can you guys offer advice on how I can find who I am again? I don&amp;#39;t know where else to turn.&lt;/p&gt;

So yeah. How do I love? I've had 2 guys in the past break up with me because they say I don't give enough and I can't love. I highly agree with them. I don't know how to show them I love them or I care for them. Usually I wake up, send a good morning text, go to school, ask how their day went &amp; send a goodnight text, sleep and repeat. We usually get into pointless conversations that I fooled myself to enjoy. I'm okay with that but it's not enough to make them happy. I know relationships are heavily dependent on communication and I feel that I say enough. I don't know what was lacking in my past relationships. I suspect that I'm just not good enough for them. I'm going through the love-yourself-first route and I think I don't really love myself enough but I don't see how that affects my apathy. Will I be magically capable of love when I learn to accept my flaws? I'm worried I'll still be a mess after I accept myself. I don't see the sense of accepting yourself when no one else accepts you. Please help me, reddit. Sometimes I feel the need to make the best out of my life but a lot of problems hold me back. I want to break past those problems and die happy.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is question is a bit heavy. I think reddit can answer it.&lt;/p&gt;
