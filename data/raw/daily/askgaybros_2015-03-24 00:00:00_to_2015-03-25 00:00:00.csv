I was unable to find a job in my university town after moving for an entire summer, I tried to shake off feelings for a friend I was previously into after she kissed me on New Years in January 2014. In November 2014 on my 21st Birthday I joined tinder traded some pics, flirted a bit but nothing serious. I met this guy we flirt a bit and then we end up talking about sex. Considering I have been single for almost 10 years now and I've had no sexual experience with anyone of either sex and my general inept social skills and general low self esteem , my body confidence as I look fat and hairy being 5ft 5 and 158lbs as well as general sadness over my mothers cancer diagnosis. I very rarely drink, I don't take recreational drugs legal and illegal apart from caffeine which is usually rare and I consider myself as being self-controlled and rational.

He sent me the results of his last tests that were all clear seemed legitimate and I stayed at his house where he barebacked me as well as exchanging blow jobs as well as being anally licked. After reading /r/askgaybros on these whilst he slept I began to see how stupid I was, so I made my excuses and left at around 8pm the following night. In the morning I went to my local clinic as I was home from university and sought PEP and completed PEP in late January. During that time I tested negative for syphilis, chlamydia, gonorrhea as well as herpes. Assumingly I was HIV negative. During that time I neglected my university work, excessively slept both overate and underate going most days without food, neglecting my looks and generally just losing interest in the things I loved. It's been three months since and today I tested negative today on a rapid Generation 3 HIV test at my local sexual health clinic. Took 60 seconds to get my results with 99% accuracy. I've had extra blood taken as a confirmatory test which should take 7-10 days. Those seconds felt like small knives stabbing into every fibre of my being. Despite being extremely relieved I believe I may need counselling for depression and/or anxiety as a result of how low I felt during this experience. I've had a blood test for syphilis, HIV and for my HEP B vaccine (which I've already had) where I should get the results in 7-10 days. 

Quick TL:DR I barebacked bottomed first time having sex. 21 years old Bisexual, mom's got cancer and parents don't know I'm Bi. HIV negative result from a rapid third generation test in 60 seconds. Have had another confirmatory test from a blood sample and will get the results from that in 7-10 days. May need counseling from this experience. Really my question is where do I go from here?

I 38, have a bf who I love, house together, dog, good job, and all is well.  I've felt a bit low recently, not depressed (I've been there and this is different), but kind of feeling sedated for a while now. The whole work/life balance has been weighing a little heavy on my mind and leaving me tired.  Friends are moving on to settle down and have kids (both the straight ones, and even some of the gay ones), but I don't feel the same way. I still want to have beers, play video games, and relax with friends on evenings in, at the pub, or days out.  Having kids and losing all of my free time would feel like a nightmare.

Anyway, I've been feeling a little robotic for a year or so.  Going through the motions at work, zoning out during commutes, feeling listless etc.

I was after something to inspire me into something new, and well, it's a little odd what's happened.

Basically, I have a bit of a crush on a tall beefy guy I see around town.  He winks at me, and is friendly, we say hi to each other on a regular basis.  I've bumped into him a couple of times in the local video game shop and chatted, briefly.  He's about 6ft 4, muscular, although a little padded.  I noticed him a while ago, thought he was handsome, and then went about my life.  6 months ago we shared a brief exchange in the video game shop, and since then I get a wink and a smile every time I walk by him.  I'm 95% sure he's straight, although he always looks back.

Recently, through an overheard conversation (about 4 weeks ago), I found out his name, and got an understanding of his hobbies, and for some reason it's stirred some quite deep feelings.  Maybe even a crush.  

Crushing isn't unusual for me.  I've gone through it from time to time, 9 times out of 10 it's usually about some unattainable guy.  The last guy I crushed on is now one of my best friends, and it's always been platonic.  I'm a shy, introverted guy, but the friendly nature that I exhibited when indulging my crush struck up a fantastic friendship, and it was a very positive thing.  I didn't care about the love/relationship thing, I had a partner, and I never even mentioned that side of it, gaining a friend and having him around was just as good, and, like I said, something very positive came of it.

So this tall guy.  He's 10 years younger than me, and into the head space that I still want to be in, beers, games, late 20s lifestyle.  Something which a lot of my friends have moved on from.

Anyway, after crushing over this guy for a few days/weeks, I discovered that it had me feeling VERY positive.  I'm hitting the gym, feeling upbeat, getting more into my hobbies (I had previously grown unfocused and generally spent evenings doing something for 10 minutes, and then moving on, unfulfilled), and generally feeling happier about who I am.  I'm spending more time with my partner, enjoying his time more.  Why?  I'm not sure.  I know that I will never have this new tall guy, I'm genuinely happy with my partner, and sure this guy is straight, but the positive vibes I get from him, or even wanting to be like him (gym fit, active, etc) are a feeling that I'm enjoying.  It feels amazing not to feel listless.  Maybe I'm basing this off previous crush experiences.  I would say I'm equally crushing (wrong word by now I'm sure) on the lifestyle, AND the man.  Even if he went away today, I'd still feel 10 times better than I did 4 weeks ago.

Is this bromance? I've considered chatting to him more and seeing if he wants to play games online.  I don't want to come across like a madman.  I'm trying to figure out my feelings.  I feel motivated and full of hope and potential.  I want to get into my life again.

Does anyone else go through this?  I'm a very, very level headed guy.  Polite, and unassuming.  I know how this reads and how (possibly) it makes me look.

I think maybe the crush is becoming an ideal about who I want to be.  (Or something!)

It's been driving me nuts for almost a week now.


I met K through grindr beginning of February and it was originally going to be a hook up type of deal. We met a few times for that but we also started realizing we had this connection. I eventually told him that I had a crush on him and to my surprise he said he felt the same way. We kept on seeing each other and come Valentine's Day, I took him out and asked him how he felt about making it an official relationship. He agreed.


Things go very well for a couple of months. We go out on dates, we have lots of sexy times, we see each other almost every day, the sky was never bluer nor the grass greener.


Two Saturdays ago, he starts getting really distant. Ignores my calls and texts. I finally get to see him on the Monday for dinner and I had to fish out why he was acting so weird. He says that his ex sent him an email saying that he was moving back into town. Apparently they have been together for a very long time before I came into the picture, that they have known each other since they were 12 (we are 25 now), that his ex has been so close to his family and has helped him with the rough patches in his life. The only reason they broke up (from what I know) is because the guy moved to Europe for work and K decided to stay here to help with his family.


K dumps me that night. He tells me that he needs to be alone for now to figure things out. He says that he doesn't think it is  good for him to be in a relationship right now and he won't be treating me properly in his current state. 


Feeling really hurt by these events and having all this pent up anger from getting ignored the whole weekend, I stormed out of dinner. He sends me a text later saying he felt like shit, apologized, and again explained that he needed to be alone.


I don't respond right away, still shocked and angry about how it ended. I text back a few days later, ""talk to me when you're ready."" Haven't contacted him since.


It's been a week and I still cant stop thinking about this guy, and I've gotten over previous longer lasting relationships with less difficulty. Everything about meeting him seemed magical I guess. We argued a bit about things but I really thought we had this deep connection that I have not been able to make with other guys, not even with my closest friends. Within 2 months of dating this guy, I stopped caring about other guys to the point that I would put the porn away so I could get off to thinking about him (I know, romantic right?) - and the scary part is I still tend to do that until now. I still think about him when I hear his favourite songs on the radio and when I pass by the places we used to eat. I don't feel this way about guys very often and I have never gotten this deep into the previous guys I've dated. I genuinely thought in my heart that we had a future together :( 


Its been almost two weeks since the break up. I want to meet him one more time to tell him how I feel about all of this. I am not going to try to force him to take me back though. I don't think I can compete with his ex and their history. I don't even know if he feels the same way. All I want is for him to know how I feel.

Should I do it or should I just leave him be?

We're in a ldr and probably see each other every 3-4 months. We do talk and webcam daily however. The other day I told him I had a dream of him cheating on me where he cammed with another guy; After that he confessed that he did about a month ago but was convinced that it wasn't cheating because it wasn't physical. 

We kind of talked about it for a bit and he was extremely apologetic and acknowledged what he did was wrong, I told him that as long as it doesn't happen again. Things have been pretty normal but I just can't stop thinking about the whole situation. I still do care for him very much and I'm sure he's the one for me, but at the same time I feel like I should be mad?

","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;ve been with my current boyfriend for over a year now. We&amp;#39;re in a ldr and probably see each other every 3-4 months. We do talk and webcam daily however. The other day I told him I had a dream of him cheating on me where he cammed with another guy; After that he confessed that he did about a month ago but was convinced that it wasn&amp;#39;t cheating because it wasn&amp;#39;t physical. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We kind of talked about it for a bit and he was extremely apologetic and acknowledged what he did was wrong, I told him that as long as it doesn&amp;#39;t happen again. Things have been pretty normal but I just can&amp;#39;t stop thinking about the whole situation. I still do care for him very much and I&amp;#39;m sure he&amp;#39;s the one for me, but at the same time I feel like I should be mad? Well I am angry at the guy that cammed with him since he kept telling my bf that it&amp;#39;s not really cheating, but whatever. I feel like I&amp;#39;m just in this weird position right now. Do I just let things go back to normal and act like it never even happened? &lt;/p&gt;

We met via work and in a short time became inseparable. I've always found him to be very smart, attractive, witty, sarcastic, and an all around amazing guy. My feelings became overbearing and otherwise too emotionally draining a few years ago. On a moment of extreme stupidity, I told him that I am in love with him. He responds by telling me that everyone in our circle knows and that I just need to ""not cross the line"". I was relieved, but then I became annoyed because he didn't want to discuss the subject any further (I wanted closure). A few months later I visited a therapist for help since I didn't want to destroy our great friendship and my feelings only grew stronger as the time passed. The therapist was not much help.

A few years after meeting him he received a job offer and a few weeks after starting with the new employer he offered me a job so that I could work with him. Therefore for most of the time I've known him we've spent every workday together. Last December I was offered a new job and that meant that I no longer spent every day with him. I hoped my feelings would go away since I'm not around him nearly as often, but now I just wake up just to think of him, I have dreams involving him at least 3-4 times a week, I sometimes think of him at random times of day, etc. It's been almost 4 months and my feelings haven't changed.

Lately when we meet up with our friends I feel horrible being around him, I want him so badly but I can never be with him. Furthermore all of our friends know about my feelings towards him. Sometimes I feel as if our friends think that I'm pitiful and foolish for feeling that way.

I've tried to put distance between us, but he always ends up coming back. I've looked for reasons to be angry at him so that I can push him away, but I can't seem to stay angry. Usually when I blame him for doing something that angered me he smirks and I melt. I figured that if I could stay angry at him he would stop caring and I could use it as an excuse for not speaking to him anymore. I've dated a few guys during the past 6.5 years but I could never fully get into the relationship because none of the guys I dated measured up to him. To me he was always smarter, sexier, funnier, and better in almost every way than whomever I was on a date with. I know that I could never be satisfied with just being his friend, therefore I must push him out of my life so that I may eventually get over this nightmare chapter in my love life. Problem is that we're friends to the same group of people, so in order to get him out I must completely get rid of all of my friends.

I'm not sure how to approach this situation. I know that if I manage to get the courage to tell him to never contact me again that I must do it over email. Doing this in person will cause me to start crying uncontrollably, just like the day that I told him I was in love with him. Thing is that even with the email option, I have no idea how to even get started.

**TLDR:** I've been in love with my straight and married best friend of 6.5 years and I've concluded that the only way to get my intense and overbearing feelings to go away is to get him out of my life. However, we share our group of friends and therefore the only way to get him out of my life is to also get rid of all of my other friends.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been having strong feelings for my straight, married, best friend for the past 6.5 years, the feelings started the moment we met.

Hey guys. So as y'all might know, I posted on this sub a few days back hoping to get some advice, and I just want to thank y'all so much. I met with my closeted friend Kyle* a few hours ago and here's how it went…

I messaged him yesterday asking if he wanted to hang out alone at his place, and he said yeah. So I get over to his place, and he looks like a mess. I give him a hug and sit on his couch. After a few awkward minutes, he and I start talking. 

Now some of y'all suggested I ask him why he gets uncomfortable when we all talk about girls, but I decided that it wouldn't be appropriate or fair for him. So after a while, I told him that I love him, and that no matter what is happening, I will always be there for him. He looked at me, and started balling his eyes out. 

Turns out his mom (who is like a second mom to me) recently got diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer, and it's been weighing heavy on him. I comforted him and told him that she would pull through and that anything he needed, I would be there for him day and night. It really was a kick in the guts when I heard this news, it really did explain his demeanour over the last few weeks…

We were talking about some other private stuff when he said that he wanted to tell me something else. I put my drink down and just stared at him. He started to mumble his words, but it finally came out (no pun intended)… He said ____, I'm gay. He said that it's something he's wanted to tell me for a while, but thought he was just confused at first, and that his feelings would go away… well clearly, they didn't lol.

I stood up, and gave him the biggest hug and kissed him on his cheek. My goodness, I was gushing like school girl. I was so happy that he accepted himself and trusted me enough to tell me (the first person by the way). I was honoured. After talking more about his journey of acceptance, I started apologizing for all the stupid shit I said about the LGBT community and assured him that it wouldn't EVER happen again and that I will take steps to make sure others don't in his company either. 

I honestly couldn't be any happier right now. Although the news about his mom was horrible to hear, he trusted me enough to tell me something about himself that he resented for a long long time, and I feel like this would only bring the two of us closer. 

So thank y'all so much for y'all's help. I really appreciate all the comments and support, y'all are awesome! If y'all are ever in Jackson, MS, you might just find me and my bro at a gay bar ;)

I recently found out a friend of mine from college died a few years ago. He was a great guy an amazing street photographer and also did everything he could to help me be comfortable with being gay. I'm heart broken, I haven't felt the need to eat for over a week, I have waves of uncontrolled sadness. 

The reason I just found out was that we live in different sides of the U.S. I graduated back in 2001 so the ways to communicate over the Internet were essentially email. So we both had life get in the way and kind of fell off the map. I just always thought he would be there when I could find time from work and life to start talking with him again. 

I don't know what to do, my family won't care and all my friends have moved on to different states, some have gotten families and their lives are their own. 

I've tried to reach out to some of the people he was friends with to get more information, but I don't think they'll want to talk so I'm not expecting them to respond.

Patrick finds out on his own that Kevin has Grindr while in a relationship. Patrick then freaks out because of it.

This brought some old memories because I've gone through a similar situation. Although my bf and I were on a break at that time, it still made me feel very uncomfortable and he always knew how I felt about those apps. He was only on it for friends. I'll admit that I'm the jealous type. However, I would feel really weird to be around my boyfriend while he's on an app, and talking to other guys. I just think it'd just lead to a disaster because I think he would most likely talk to guys he finds most attractive lol. We had our biggest argument because of this.

If I'm gonna be in a relationship, I want it strictly just my boyfriend and I. No open relationship, or dating apps. It'll just lead to trouble.

In general, what do you guys think of apps while in a relationship?

Met this guy online, we where into a lot of the same stuff, video games, he was the asian of my dreams, I was his white meat, all that good stuff.

Due to Canadian winters and not having the ability to do romps in the sheets yet, we mainly just talked online, played WoW, LoL, Diablo 3, etc.

Bumped up to me sharing my dudesnude profile, he started sending the sexiest bathroom nude selfies, we even started making plans to have full day sexcapades once I get my place to myself in the summer or even go to a bath house if the situation permits and we are that level of horny.

So sent him a selfie from school since I'm here late, non nude but with pants kinda pulled down to show off the hellow with red trim aussiebum undies I have that I want to get a pikachu hat for to be a gay pikachu at gay pride.

So sent him that and he replies that.... his boyfriend doesn't want him recieving pictures of other dudes any more for obvious reasons.

Heart sank, I know it wasn't even anything yet but the past few days where all what we would like it to become.

Deleted the shot, told him I was confused as he sent the first nude but alas I didn't want to step on any toes, message received.

Next reply was that it was the boyfriend responding, that its a relationship and shit happens, he was probably bored of him and trusts that he never met up with me (was true despite us both kinda wanting it, or so I thought) and was sorry I got involved...

UGHHHHH

First attempt at  relationship since coming out to family and its one of /r/askgaybros top story styles right after ""I'm crushing on my straight friend""

I dunno, just needed to vent and type it out, I know it takes time/will find someone else/he wasn't worth it/if he'll do that behind his back hes likely to do it behind mine/etc

I now understand others posts like this, will never judge them (in my head) as I did before, this fucking sucks and as I'm sure I will be reminded, it wasn't even anything yet.

&lt;p&gt;Next reply was that it was the boyfriend responding, that its a relationship and shit happens, he was probably bored of him and trusts that he never met up with me (was true despite us both kinda wanting it, or so I thought) and was sorry I got involved...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UGHHHHH&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First attempt at  relationship since coming out to family and its one of &lt;a href=""/r/askgaybros""&gt;/r/askgaybros&lt;/a&gt; top story styles right after &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m crushing on my straight friend&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dunno, just needed to vent and type it out, I know it takes time/will find someone else/he wasn&amp;#39;t worth it/if he&amp;#39;ll do that behind his back hes likely to do it behind mine/etc&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I now understand others posts like this, will never judge them (in my head) as I did before, this fucking sucks and as I&amp;#39;m sure I will be reminded, it wasn&amp;#39;t even anything yet.&lt;/p&gt;

A solidarity post if you will. 

I'm still a little flabbergasted by the rise of the popularity of the beard (and general hairiness) amongst gays. I had always been a clean shaven lad, and I guess my preference is clean shaven (I don't have strong stubble feelings anyway, and more isn't necessarily a deal breaker though). To each their own, but of course I keep running into the frequent problem of crushing on boys who are really into beards. Then I see the guys the are into and have that immature moment of ""Um, literally all he has going for him is a beard. If I had a beard I'd look so much better than at."" 

So of course sometimes I look in the mirror and think, ""I should give it a try."" But it doesn't grow very fast. I only get something resembling 5 o'clock shadow at around 5 o'clock the next day. Plus my hair is a light brunette that can reflect as almost blonde (some of the mustache hairs actually do come in blonde), so it's not even the most noticeable thing at first. My stubble is hard to detect in shitty photos, for example. I'm not going to be king of the beards (but every dude in my family has -- or has had -- a pretty good one), but I'm sure after two to three weeks I'd be working with something alright. However, I end up having to go to something in the meantime I want to look nice for and just shave it. The longest I've gone is maybe like 8 days. It gets itchy too. 

It's funny though, because its a change you can make to your appearance that can totally alter the type and pool of guys who are attracted to you that doesn't take lifestyle changes and months/years of work. It's literally like, ""Don't shave for two weeks."" It's not like ""Oh, he's into super jacked muscle guys and I'm just not that so whatever."" It's just like, ""Well, I could be that type pretty easily, hmm...""  

It's not a big issue, but I swear every few months I go through it. Anyone else? ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not so much an advice post as it is a &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not the only one, right?&amp;quot; post. A solidarity post if you will. &lt;/p&gt;

My boyfriend and I broke up. I suppose I should say ex-boyfriend. I've cried and sobbed and wondered where I've gone wrong. It still hurts so much just to even type these words. 

We met in undergrad. We fell in love so fast. Maybe that was our problem. Maybe we rushed it. Maybe I gave too much too soon. We graduated together. I saw us building a life, a future. We fought, sure, but we always overcame it. We're best friends. We told each other everything. He helped me through my eating disorders and I through his turmoils. One of our biggest hurdles was graduation. What would we do?  How would we be together?  We pushed through it. We decided on California, him for law school and me for graduate school in education. Sure, we wouldn't be at the same institution but we were close enough to live together. We found a solution to what felt like a terrible problem.  I figured we could last through anything. 

Before I continue, you have to understand that I don't hate him. I honestly can't hate him. The type of love I was raised to give was sacrificial. I do everything to make him happy. His happiness is my priority. I hate myself for it but I can't bear any ill will toward him. I still love him so much and my entire body aches thinking that he's happy with someone else. But when I see him smile, the elation on his face and the way his eyes light up with this other boy, I can't help but be happy despite the pain. It kills me but that means nothing because he's so happy. 

We'd been having problems for a while now. From having threesomes, to opening our relationship, to taking a ""break,"" all the signs were there that we were over but I was too stupid and pathetic and stubborn to admit it. We were just hovering on the precipice of being over and this past Saturday was us falling over the edge.  You see, he's been head over heels for this other boy for quite some time. Many weeks, if not months. Probably since we first met him in October. It's been a silly and turbulent ride of emotions but long story short is that my boyfriend...excuse me ex-boyfriend has wanted to date this boy for a while and I have been trying to help and support him in any way I can.

So, at Beyond Wonderland this Saturday, I talked to the object of my ex's desires. I told him that my ex liked him a lot, that my ex wanted to date him.  This boy said he had an idea of that but didn't want to make things awkward because he valued me as a friend. In my rave induced daze and want for my ex's happiness,  I gave them my blessing for lack of a better phrase.  They kissed under fireworks to Hardwell. It was beautiful to be perfectly honest. They both said thank you and my heart soared. I don't think I'd seen either of them that happy in a long long time. 

However that elation didn't last long. All my good vibes stopped when the realization hit me that we were done. Four years built up were suddenly gone. I held back tears. I didn't think it would have hurt as much as it did. We still live together. We have a dog. He says he loves me but I know he's not in love with me. At least not in the way I am with him. He isn't happy with me and hasn't been in a long time. They say that you have to let go of the things you care about if it's what's best for them. I know it's what's best for him. 

I just don't know what's best for me now. I don't think we were good together, at least not in the end stages of our relationship. We've been together for so long I don't know who I am without him. I don't know what I should be doing. I don't know how to make it stop hurting. Suddenly I'll tear up and have to breathe so deep to make it go away. I'll get this aching so deep that it won't go away. I gave him everything and I feel like I'm left with nothing. I see them holding hands and all I want to do is sob more and more. I smile though. I put on a good show so his new boy doesn't feel bad about my hurting. I act perfectly content so that they can be happy.

I can't be selfish. I don't know how to be. I was never taught to be selfish. I was told to be selfless so that others can be happy. I don't know how to do things for myself without thinking of others. It sounds really egotistical, I don't mean to be. I honestly feel terrible if I do something that benefits only me. I don't know how to be me anymore. I can't help but feel like I could have done more to keep him. I can't stop thinking that it's all my fault that he's with someone else or that there was something I did wrong. 

I don't know what to do anymore. I want to stop hurting and I don't know how to do that. All I know is that nothing feels right anymore.

recently i started to notice that my BF of 1 year began acting weird whenever i asked for his phone (to navigate, or look up a restaurant, etc.) i've been cheated on before, so i knew this was a definite red flag. 

for some context, we have talked extensively about how important honesty is in a relationship, and reiterated that we can talk to each other about anything. he has told me repeatedly that being honest is his #1 most important value. 

this weekend i approached him about how he was acting strange when i had his phone, and asked if he would let me look at his text messages. i told him that he could tell me anything, i just wanted him to be honest. he said ""i have absolutely nothing to hide"" and gave me  his phone. i looked through about 3 weeks of messages and there was nothing. but then i asked if i could look on his macbook. 

when i opened up iMessage on there i found 3 people he had sexted that week, sending naked photos and saying stuff like ""so horny"" ""feeling vers"" etc. clearly he had been deleting messages from his phone, but hadn't from his computer. 

he broke down and said that he had done it because he was horny, and that he had never actually met up with anyone. he apologized, and said he feels really bad, but i'm still struggling with the fact that he blatantly lied to my face, particularly after telling me so many times that honesty was important to him. 

i told him i need some time to think about our relationship. i'm looking for advice on whether i should forgive him and continue this relationship, or whether that makes me a pushover. 

what do you think, bros? am i naive to go back to him, or is this an honest mistake he made? ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;hey bros, &lt;/p&gt;

When I was a kid I was on the heavy side, after hitting puberty the weight just kind of dropped off and now I am happy with my current size. The problem is my face really, it's just ugly and it makes me feel sad whenever I look in a mirror. There's nothing I can do to change it though so I was wondering if there are any ways to live with it? Like how to actually embrace how I look?

I also wear glasses which I think make me look even worse, I tried contacts but they didn't work out, I plan on getting laser eye surgery in a few years. The thing that annoys me most is that I can take really nice photos which make me look attractive but in real life I look like a potato... This is the main reason why I won't make a tinder or online dating profile - I'm scared they will see me in real life and be disappointed.

&lt;p&gt;Also I&amp;#39;ve just noticed how whiny this posts sounds, just needed to vent how I feel sorry.&lt;/p&gt;

so I've met up with this guy about 3 times in the past for naughty blowjobs in public areas, but by now I think he passes the not-a-creep test and I'd like to try a little something more besides oral. the only thing is, I'm pretty inexperienced with sex in general. with the 3 or so dicks I've sucked I still gag when it gets past the tongue. I've been practicing with my toothbrush to get used to having long, girtht objects in there since it kinda comes with the territory and I'm getting better at it. 

he's 22 and I'm 19 but the thing is, he has a **really** long and kinda thick dick. long like 7 1/2"" of uncut,  thick Italian sausage (which is awesome :D). I've tried fingering myself before but it just feels like reverse pooping and... weird. I know it takes some getting used to the feeling,  but I still haven't found my prostate which makes me wonder where the pleasure comes from. the first time I was ever with a guy, I asked him to stick just the head in (seriously, just the tip haha) and it felt pretty good in a nice and full kind of way but there was no further thrusting after that. 

so is there anything else I can do to prepare? I don't have access to toys I could practice on so it's really just my fingers that I have. 1-2 fingers, ok I can do that, anything after that it gets weird finding the right angle to stuff everything in there. and I'm making sure to be safe the entire time so condoms will be used. we're planning on meeting up this Thursday or Friday so I've got about a week to ""practice"". thanks for your help bros!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;first &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt; I mean...&lt;/p&gt;
