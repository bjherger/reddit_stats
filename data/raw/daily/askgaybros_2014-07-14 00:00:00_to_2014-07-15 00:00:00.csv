Yesterday something happened that left me pretty traumatized.  So I met someone at a this gaymer convention, you may have heard of it, and we went out later last night afterwards and had a blast, he was from out of town so we ended up going back to my place... We were both just looking for fun and I was a little surprised when he had ""supplies"" with him in his bag.   Toys etc.. Pro move but weird... Anyways he pulled out GHB as well and asked me if I wanted.  I don't prefer GHB especially as a top, so I declined, but said he was free to do what he wanted. So he poured some in a glass of water and we started making out and he was going crazy erotic intimate (I knew he would which is why I didn't care if he as the Bttm wanted to do it) and it was super intense and fun, he got up after it had already gotten pretty close to full on, took another drink, stood there for a second, stumbled over to the chair in my room and passed out.   Overdosed.  Having seen this before I covered him, turned him on his side so his head would rest in a way that kept his throat open if he started to vomit and kinda watched... About an hour in he puked (I had previously aimed his mouth towards a trashcan, smart) got up eyes blazing red, puked again and started gasping, but was totally incoherent and un-responsive so now I had to call 911 and get the paramedics involved.  I spent two hours with the police in the middle of the night explaining to them that he had ghb'd himself and I didn't do it to him.   They were obviously suspicious and I don't blame them one bit.   
It seems to me that ghb is becoming more prevalent and I think it's really dangerous  I mean that dude seriously could have died in my house last night.   I'm kinda rethinking my, ""you can do whatever you want to do as long as I can pass and we play safe"" attitude and just say no period... I dunno was I wrong to let him do it in the first place?  He seemed to know what he was doing.

My boyfriend and I have been dating for 5 months now. He has a *huge* thing for gingers (totally fine, I do too) and has said before that he's always wanted to sleep with one because he never has before (kind of OK, nothing serious). He's joked about having 'one exception' within our relationship; should either of us have the chance to sleep with a ginger, we would.

For the longest time I thought he was joking. Recently though, I've got the feeling he hasn't been joking and this is something he's actively pursuing. Just last night, he again joked about it and after I gave him 'the look', he laughed and said 'I would never cheat on you...except with a ginger'...more laughing (from him, not me). Another time he joked about it and after telling him I didn't want to share him, he laughed about me being a jealous boyfriend. Just now, we were texting, it came up and I said 'It's fun to joke about, but I'd rather have you ;)'....his response: ""Aww, thanks baby, but if you have a chance with your ginger you have to take it. :p' (admittedly, I have a bit of crush on my (possibly gay or curious) roommate but, would never do anything)

Point is, I'm pretty sure he's serious about this. Honestly, it's not something I'm totally sure about. I'm pretty sure he doesn't think it would be cheating because he's been up front about it from the start (which he has been but, when I thought he was joking). He's spending the next week 8 hours away with his family and I'm a bit of a wreck. I care a lot about this guy and he feels the same way about me so,  a part of me is *OK* with it...it would be a one time thing...it's not love and we could move past it. Another part of me is the 'jealous boyfriend' and wishes he were joking but, I'm afraid he's not. Not sure whether to be angry or sad...I'm just confused.

What is Love in a “LGBTQ Relationship”?
Why should LGBTQ get a Community Center directed towards Teens?
What “rights” are taken Away from the LGBTQ Community?

Situation---


So we still work together this summer, things seemed to be okay between us.  Talking a lot during work and outside of work.  Saw each other a couple of times in person outside of work since my last post.  I asked him yesterday if he wanted to see a movie.  He asked which one.  I told him whatever he wanted to see, and he said he would let me know.  He then messaged me back an hour later saying nothing looks good.  Then I said maybe we can do something else tonight.  He said he was busy and had to clean his room and help around the house all day.  Told him w/e.  

I messaged him later in the evening to talk about work, and he says ""I'm out with friends right now, can't talk.""  I then messaged him back saying ""Friend of convenience, much?""  He was confused and then figured out what I meant and all he said was ""sorry.""  I told him it wasn't the first time he did this and he goes ""I know sorry."" 

 I then told him how I felt about doing all this stuff for him and being there for him before he got his car, and now he always blows me off when I ask for something or to hang out.  He says ""I know what you mean, idk i'll ttyl.""  This happened last night, haven't heard from him since nor did I reply. 

Did I do the right thing?  I didn't want to come off as desperate to hang out with him, but I didn't want to appear as a pushover either.  I felt betrayed and that he walked all over me this whole time.  Maybe I'm thinking too much into this.  Problem is I will have to see him at work tomorrow so I don't know how I should act around him. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Background info on this person...
