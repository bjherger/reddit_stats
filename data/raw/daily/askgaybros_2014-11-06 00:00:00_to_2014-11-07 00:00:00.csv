Well, I have discovered that he has been swapping photos with guys online. Not frequently, I don't think, and probably only for flirty photo swapping purposes.

Anyway, Hello.
I'm a 32 year old man from eastern Europe. I'm the father of two girls, but I lost my wife in an accident a long time ago.

For all my life I've never been interested in other men, not even curios.
I'm not homophobic, other men just never tickled my fancy, neither romantically or sexually. In fact I've never really been into anything besides 'vanilla' hetero sex. My wife was into some kinkier stuff, but it didn't do much for me.

About a year and a half after my wife died, I met a guy, I'll call him Tom in this thread.
Tom is unlike any person I've ever met. Generally I tend to not be very good with other people (not including my daughters) for extended periods of time, but with Tom, it was never a problem.
The only other person I've felt that way about, was my wife.

Tom and I quickly grew very close. Then I started feeling weird whenever the was around.
At first I told myself this feeling was just how very good friends feel about each other, because how would I know, I've hardly ever had such a close friend before.
Then Tom crept into my mind, and I started having dreams, then fantasies, about sexual situations with him. 

Now, this is the part where it gets confusing.
At first, when this started happening, I told myself ""Yelp, I'm gay"", but then I realized I don't feel this way about other men at all.
I still prefer women, and I feel *nothing* looking at/thinking about other men. The idea of gay sex doesn't turn me on at all, neither does any gay imagery.
It's just when it's Tom it's different.

Also, I feel like I'm very much in love with Tom, I want him in my life, I want to be insider of him, I want to hold him and protect him the way I held my wife.
But when I think about him, and the way I love him, it's not like I imagine us marrying and heaving kids.
I love him, but I don't love him the same way I did my wife, which is very confusing to me.

We're 23/24... One of my friends is gay, the other straight. We've been friends for probably 8-9 years now.

I've been out for about 5 years. My friend has been out for about 2. In the last two years, despite knowing for sure that we're both gay, I've never had a crush on this friend nor thought of him as anything at all beyond just a friend.

But over the last month... I just feel things... changing. I'm seeing something that I didn't see before, and I don't know how I missed it if it's always been there. I always thought he was a bit... rough. Like he's not the kind of guy I fantasize about being with, typically. He's a bit less educated, more likely to respond to things physically rather than mentally/emotionally... Much more grounded in the concrete rather than the abstract world. But I'm seeing a sensitive side I never really saw before, despite being best friends... We just sat up together for like 2 hours after our other roommate went to sleep, going through all his old FB photos and laughing/talking about the stories involved... He's also started hugging me randomly, which isn't something we ever did before. I feel like I'm seeing the 'real him' now.

But, backing this up to my concerns. 1) I'm still not really sure what I'm feeling. I've dated before, and I've had boyfriends where I knew within the first 5 seconds of talking that I wanted to pursue them. I'm not really sure what it is I'm feeling here. I'm definitely re-evaluating him.. I don't know if he now falls into the category of ""someone I'm interested in"" or just ""someone who's a great friend that I have a deeper understanding of now"".. Also 2) We're roommates. All three of us rely on each other to pay rent. I KNOW any relationship would mean we start off living together, which scares me. Granted, I've known him for 9ish years. But something still feels inherently wrong about starting a relationship maybe with someone I'm already living with. But I can't deny the thought is there, or that there's SOMETHING going on here that wasn't going on here before.... I just don't know what it is.

We were both deep in the closet, like further than Narnia. To give you an idea, we are both Latino men whose families are hardcore Catholics and view being gay as the worst thing a person can be in life. We finally realized one drunken night our affection and made it physical. Everytime this happened, the next morning he would shrug it off and say it was in the past and it was 'just a thing that happened.' This continued on for about five years (mind you, we only see each other twice every year because he lives far from me). So, I have come to understand who I am and just two weeks ago came out to my family, which has been its own struggle. However, since I told him I came out we saw each other once, just this past weekend, but he put distance between us. I was so heart broken. I didn't really know what to expect, he never admitted that he is gay, not even to our closest friends. So, we went our separate ways again but it kept eating at me, the way he treated me, it hurt. So, I called him and we spoke about it for quite some time. He kept telling me that it is against his values and that he is saving himself for marriage and that he doesn't feel the same as me. He would then tell me that he wants to see me and spend time together like we used to (referring to the times we hung out without having physical interactions) and that he really wants to be in my life. I told him that it is really hard for me because I love him so. He responded that it will be ok that we just have to hang out in order to move forward. He says move forward which came across as having two meanings to me, he said it to imply that hanging out would move us forward away from the times that we admitted our attraction through physical love yet moving forward to me means moving forward in the direction of that very love. I feel as though he is truly split within himself and speaking from family tradition and value. I told him that those times are the very reason that I love him and that the physical interactions we had were physical representations of that. He told me that he just can't see it that way and that he is very good at detatching himself from emotions, he said he is icecold, that he even detatches himself from his emotions towards his family. Now, the question I have is what do I do. I know that the healthiest thing for me to do would be to drop him out of my life. But I love him and I want him to be who he is. The idea of him living a lie brings me so much pain. He is such an amazing person that has so much to offer. I am stuck. Please help me shed light on this even if it is telling me to let it be. Help, I need somebody, help.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have had an intimate friend for a long time, the last 10 years. We were both deep in the closet, like further than Narnia. To give you an idea, we are both Latino men whose families are hardcore Catholics and view being gay as the worst thing a person can be in life. We finally realized one drunken night our affection and made it physical. Everytime this happened, the next morning he would shrug it off and say it was in the past and it was &amp;#39;just a thing that happened.&amp;#39; This continued on for about five years (mind you, we only see each other twice every year because he lives far from me). So, I have come to understand who I am and just two weeks ago came out to my family, which has been its own struggle. However, since I told him I came out we saw each other once, just this past weekend, but he put distance between us. I was so heart broken. I didn&amp;#39;t really know what to expect, he never admitted that he is gay, not even to our closest friends. So, we went our separate ways again but it kept eating at me, the way he treated me, it hurt. So, I called him and we spoke about it for quite some time. He kept telling me that it is against his values and that he is saving himself for marriage and that he doesn&amp;#39;t feel the same as me. He would then tell me that he wants to see me and spend time together like we used to (referring to the times we hung out without having physical interactions) and that he really wants to be in my life. I told him that it is really hard for me because I love him so. He responded that it will be ok that we just have to hang out in order to move forward. He says move forward which came across as having two meanings to me, he said it to imply that hanging out would move us forward away from the times that we admitted our attraction through physical love yet moving forward to me means moving forward in the direction of that very love. I feel as though he is truly split within himself and speaking from family tradition and value. I told him that those times are the very reason that I love him and that the physical interactions we had were physical representations of that. He told me that he just can&amp;#39;t see it that way and that he is very good at detatching himself from emotions, he said he is icecold, that he even detatches himself from his emotions towards his family. Now, the question I have is what do I do. I know that the healthiest thing for me to do would be to drop him out of my life. But I love him and I want him to be who he is.

A little bit about me: I'm a junior in high school and well that's pretty much all you need to know about me. And I have never made the initiative in any of my relationships/friendships.

As the title says this is a question about getting to know this guy I have a crush on and we shall call him Jack. He's a senior in the same high school and suprisingly enough we have some of the same classes, anyways... First time I saw him was at one of my math courses last spring and I immediately felt like I was falling for him. Fast forward two months and I grew a pair and first came out to my ex-girlfriend who is pretty much one of my closest friends right now. Fast forward another couple of months and I grew another pair and mustered the courage to come out to my family (at this point school had already started again and I started seeing Jack in classes again, hadn't talked to him at this point, ever.) Coming out to my family and them accepting it completely gave me the greatest boost of courage and a week later I decided to do something about Jack. So after talking to a friend about this I decided taht I had to do a 'surprise attack'on Jack after the usual math class of Thursday. Math class ended and I almost didn't but had to grow a third pair and stop by his desk and ask him out to go bowling because I am totally inexperienced with any sort of dating (or asking people out) pretty much (even though I've been in 2 short relationships with 2 girls in junior high.) As I asked him my heart was pounding out of my chest because he's incredibly good looking that it's a bit intimidating and I don't even know if he 'swings that way'. So I ask him if he likes bowling and wanted to go for free to get to know eachother and he says that he'd have to check when he's free to do so. I take that as a yes and I'm really happy and excited about it. I make my first mistake here and don't ask for his number nor do i give him mine.

He doesn't get back to me about it on Friday, understandable it's not like I'd be his first priority. During the weekend we don't see each other and after the weekend there's a week-long holiday so no school and I'm away for the whole week anyways. On the Monday after the holiday he still hasn't come to me about the bowling and I don't want to make him uncomfortable about it by asking him if he's figured out a good date for it. Later that Monday I talk to my good friend I met on /r/gaybros about it and I declare that if he doens't get back to me about the bowling by the end of the week I would just get over it and move on. No harm done. So he doesn't do anything on Tuesday nor Wednesday, Thursday or on Friday. After I get home on Friday I decide that there's nothing here to be going after, life goes on no big deal at all.

On Monday I'm repeating to myself in my head ""Please don't come to me today, please don't come to me today..."" Can you guess what happened, I had decided that I'd forget him, didn't want him to return to me about the bowling? Yes, he came to me about the bowling on that Monday. I just listened to what he had to say and answered his questions about the bowling thing. He also said that he doesn't have his car right now and public transportation is inconvenient, so right now I'm assuming that when he gets his car from where ever it is we're going to set up a date for it. I still repeated my mistake and didn't ask for his number/give him mine.

So finally the questions...
- When we do go bowlin' what should I look out for to see if he has any interest in me whatsoever (God that sounds stupid to say)
- What sort of questions should I ask him to get to know him and waht he likes and all? I mean I want to know a whole lot about him and become great friends at least if not more.
- If it's a great success how the hell do I give him my number/ask his after we're done? I thought of giving mine on a good ol' paper and pen and say something like ""We should hang out again soon! Here's my number if you want to do this again, or just for wahtever you want to do with it.""
- And lastly I feel like an hour of bowling is kind of a  short time to get to know a pretty much complete stranger. Is there any other suggestions for activities or anything to do in a city/town that don't require a bunch of money/reservations? (Ex. walk around/go sit somewhere)

I just come in a lot and make an effort to smile at him when I see him making sandwiches or at the register. I can tell he gets kind of nervous around me whenever I come in. 
              Anyways I have no idea hot to approach this dude. i am pretty sure most of his co-workers think he I straight. He is also so good looking to the point that it isn&amp;#39;t even fair. To be honest I am just extremely afraid of rejection. I guess I would consider myself a &amp;quot;good looking&amp;quot; guy. I mean my nose is kind of big but whatever (jewishboyproblems). Anyways I am getting a haircut and cleaning myself up before I go back in this weekend. I don&amp;#39;t even know this kid&amp;#39;s name. How do I even approach him/ask him out? Although I live in Vermont, there are not that many gay dudes around here in the part I go to school in. Any tips on what to say? &lt;/p&gt;

He and I had been seeing each other just over 3 months and labeled for about 2. Sparing you the details, it was perfect. Everything about each other surpassed our own expectations and that was a frequent conversation we had about how lucky we were. So I guess we got caught up in that and I never saw it coming. 

He picked me up one night and told me he didn't love me the way he thought he did. That we should change the nature of our relationship but still be friends. I was actually speechless for the first time in my life. All I was able to muster was that I loved him, he was breaking my heart, and that I wanted to go home. 

Fast forward two days later, and he hadn't stopped txting me. Essentially his messages boiled down to ""I'm so sorry, I love you so much, I miss you, I regret breaking up with you...... But I'm to overwhelmed with X, Y &amp; Z to be in a healthy relationship. Please be my friend.""

So I made him come see me because it wasn't a conversation I wanted to have via txt message. I said everything I'd thought about and felt, how selfish it was to dump me and ask to be my friend. Where had all this stress come from and why did he tell me about it before? How did I not see it, and if I had noticed little things he shrugged it off and it wasn't fair for me to push him to talk about things he didn't want to. I was hurt, confidence lost, I felt like that whole time together meant nothing. So he cracked. He spilled everything about everything. We'd seriously never had that deep of a conversation. So I forgave him, albeit without promising to be his friend, and he agreed we'd let the dust settle and talk about us later when he got his shit together. 

SOO... I guess what I'm asking, after reading the context as well as I can convey it to the best of my understanding... WTF? Is he trying to let me down easy but still avoid being my boyfriend by saying he regrets it etc? Is he genuinely so overwhelmed that taking one thing off his plate (me) is helpful to him? Should I be understanding or pissed off that I'm something he can do without.  

It's just super confusing, and obviously my friends are on my side and tell me what they think I was to hear. I need a reality check!

All right, so.  Here in Chicago, they're running a contest called [Barlesque](http://barlesque.org/).  It's for charity, but basically, it boils down to a ""beauty"" contest for bartenders at gay bars throughout the city.  The more money raised in one person's name, the more revealing their photos become.  It's kind of brilliant in a marketing sense, but that's just the setup.

A friend of mine is close with a couple of the dudes involved, therefore I know them vaguely (as in, I've met them at the bar maybe once).  I don't know how relevant that is to my overall question.  

I've noticed this before, but I think I might have some sort of issue with overt sexuality.  As in, it makes me extremely uncomfortable.  

Don't get me wrong, I like porn just fine, but browsing through these photos of friends-of-a-friend, and even the other people that I don't know, I get sort of... uncomfortable.  I don't know how else to describe it, but I can guarantee that while I find them sexy, I don't get *turned on* by the pictures in any sense.  Mostly I just want to move away from them.  I was the same way with an ex: he liked to do his ""sexy dance"" for me in the nude, and while it was cute, all I could think was ""this would be much better if you had clothes on"".  Especially with his dick swinging around.

So, the question boils down to: am I the only one who thinks this way?  That avoids strippers/go-go boys because they just seem to be trying too hard?  That doesn't see the need for attractive men to be naked to want to have sex with them, and in fact typically finds himself turned off to sex with a nearly-naked man in an incongrous situation (that is, at a bar as opposed to at a pool), despite finding them sexy?

It's a weird cognitive dissonance I have trouble putting words to, so maybe y'all can help me out.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Title might not be the best wording.&lt;/p&gt;
