When I was younger, I was very overweight, I was 19st 7lbs which is 124 kilograms for those who use metric. Over the years I have lost all that weight and am now sitting at 11st 10lbs which is about 75 kilos. Once I had lost all my weight, I had to have an operation on my chest at the age of 22 (I'm now 25) and it has left me with a somewhat disfigured chest. It's not horrendous by any means but it has always been there in my mind and on a very basic level, I don't know whether it makes me unattractive.

I've taken some photos for you to see http://imgur.com/a/0l0co#1

It's worse on the left hand side than the right. Sorry if it's difficult to see, it's not the easiest thing to get a good photo off but you can see it in some of the photos. 

I'm not the most sexually active person because of this. I've only ever had 2 encounters and they didn't end in sex and they were both over 2 years ago and since then, I've really just held myself back because I'm self conscious of this. I'm really just looking for some feedback on whether you think it looks horrible or whether it wouldn't bother you. I realise everyone is different and some guys are only interested in massive pecks and a six pack but I'm hoping for some honest answers here.

Thanks for the input and feel free to ask for more information.

Edit: Just want to thank people for your input, it might seem silly or dumb to some people but it has been an issue for me for a while and I honestly do take your advice/comments to heart.

A little back-story. So my boyfriend and I just broke up after 3 years. Things have been getting difficult since I moved home from college and started to deal more and more with my horrible family. I joined a gym and to my surprise, really took to weight lifting. It became my safe place when shit hit the fan at home, and a source of confidence since my work showed. In short lifting kept me sane and healthy. He on the other hand, still lives a very sedentary lifestyle. Our relationship got worse when he moved out and lost his car. Neither of us had any reliable transportation outside of the weekends. Even then we both had work.  The gym visit tonight was just the last straw. I'm wondering if we just grew apart too much if such a choice was a big enough trigger, or if I really should have went with him.

So tonight I went to the gym. Its 24 hours so I usually go later. I planned on going around 10pm. Around 7 I decided to take a nap. Guess I was tired since that nap lasted until 1:30am, sleeping well through my alarm.  Its not an issue since the gym is 24 hour and work starts in the late afternoon today, so I made the decision to get up and go.   I changed my clothes, grabbed a snack, and checked to see if anyone message me on FB while I wake up  (Cell is out for repairs).  My now ex boyfriend sees me online and hits me up. We chatted for a little bit and he asked to come get me since he has the car this weekend. He insisted on coming over right now to get me even though I told him I only got up to go to the gym and Ill probably just pass out a little after my workout is over. So its probably not a good idea.  Turns out I had no choice since he was already on his way because I responded. Again I warn him he might have to wait until I finish before I leave.

I get to the gym 5 minutes after, take a per-workout, get situated and get ready to do legs. By now its around 230am and I'm only in my second set when he shows up. I go out to say ""HI"" and see what he wants to do. Its obvious he just finished drinking as he gets out to give me a hug. After a kiss he asked me to grab my things and get in the car.  I tell him I just got here, and I can probably finish in 40-45 minutes so he can just park. Like a switch he goes from happy to sad. Telling me how disappointed he is and how he just wanted to spend a night with me.  We go back and forth trying to decide what to do. I ask him to wait until I finish, he wants me to drop it and go. We go on for 20 minutes before he ends up leaving. I tell him multiple times that I can drive over after if he doesn't want to wait for me at the gym, but to him, that wasn't acceptable. I had to leave now or not come over at all. He then drives off. 

I got back and in get another few sets in before I get a message on Facebook from him saying hes disappointed and its over.  He thinks I chose the gym over him entirely and since I go 5 nights a week, that I can skip one to see him.  I told him that he was warned earlier I was going to the gym tonight and he would have to wait. If I wasn't going to the gym I would have never have gotten up at 1:30am to see his message in the first place. 

tl;dr: Boyfriend breaks up when I insist I finish my work out than sleeping over at 230am when he randomly visits.

The problem is that I'm in love with him and he is showing me signs that he likes me more than a fuck toy too. I really don't know what to do, I'm unemployed and renting to him is the only way I'm getting money, I have no friends, and he makes me feel like a prince.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m an escort, and was seeing different guys up until 2012. Then In December 2012 I was contacted by a celebrity that is straight and very well known. We did stuff and I thought it was a one time thing so I didn&amp;#39;t get attached. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then he started to message me more and more, and renting me more and more, I get gifts from him and the sex is GREAT. He made me promise to stop seeing other guys and only see him (paranoid about giving his wife an std), and I agreed since I like him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that I&amp;#39;m in love with him and he is showing me signs that he likes me more than a fuck toy too. I really don&amp;#39;t know what to do, I&amp;#39;m unemployed and renting to him is the only way I&amp;#39;m getting money, I have no friends, and he makes me feel like a prince. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it a good idea to tell him how I really feel? Should I tell his wife what is happening? Should I tell the media? I&amp;#39;m so confused. &lt;/p&gt;

He lost interest after I sent him a face pic. Everybody talks about how easy it is for gay guys to find someone to fool around with but in my experience it's next to impossible. I live in a college town with nearly 50k people and still nothing.
