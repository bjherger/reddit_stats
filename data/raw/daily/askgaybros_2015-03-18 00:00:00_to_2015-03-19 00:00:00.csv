I have this friend I went to college with. She's beautiful, smart, hilarious. You know, the works. I really had feelings for her when I met her, but one time at a party we got a bit drunk and she told me she was not interested in younger guys (she's about 3 years older than me) so after that I knew it could never happen, and I gave up. Since then my feelings for her are completely gone, and we are the best of friends. 

She was engaged all of last year, but she broke off the engagement because the guy cheated on her at the beginning of the year. She's been going on dates and stuff since. She straight up said I just want some fun, nothing serious for a while. Today she straight up told me she was horny, and wants a D. But she wants to do it when someone she is comfortable with, not someone new because she would feel like a whore. 

She never really straight up asked me, but I can't help to shake the feeling maybe I should have some fun with her. Even though my feelings for her are gone, we are completely comfortable with each other, we share all of our intimate stuff, and etc? 

anyway, long story short, should I go after this? and if I do, how should I go about? Not going to lie, I'm VERY deep in the friend zone, so how can I let her know I would wanna bang, but still be good friends?

They are still people and a part of this community. However, I have never met someone with HIV/AIDS (that I know of) nor have I been in a relationship with someone who does.

Now, a very good friend of mine, who's also gay, recently met a guy on Tinder. I don't know ALL the details but I know they've been talking for a few weeks and seem to have hit it off. My friend is thinking of meeting this guy in person for this time, and driving a few hours away to meet him. There's nothing wrong with that in my eyes and I support him.

What I need advice is on something he told me tonight. My friend told me that this guy is HIV+. He's done his research about having sex with someone who has HIV and is intelligent and wouldn't do anything that would put him at risk.

But I'm so unfamiliar with it that I just want to make sure that I don't say the wrong thing. I told him that if he's really into this guy that having HIV shouldn't be a dealbreaker (because this guy has apparently been undetectable for years).

Thoughts? Advice? Thanks!!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: I&amp;#39;m just gonna say outright that I don&amp;#39;t think people living with HIV/AIDS should be shunned. They are still people and a part of this community. However, I have never met someone with HIV/AIDS (that I know of) nor have I been in a relationship with someone who does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, a very good friend of mine, who&amp;#39;s also gay, recently met a guy on Tinder. I don&amp;#39;t know ALL the details but I know they&amp;#39;ve been talking for a few weeks and seem to have hit it off. My friend is thinking of meeting this guy in person for this time, and driving a few hours away to meet him. There&amp;#39;s nothing wrong with that in my eyes and I support him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I need advice is on something he told me tonight. My friend told me that this guy is HIV+. He&amp;#39;s done his research about having sex with someone who has HIV and is intelligent and wouldn&amp;#39;t do anything that would put him at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;#39;m so unfamiliar with it that I just want to make sure that I don&amp;#39;t say the wrong thing.

I know its gonna take time to get to my goal fitness level.

I still can't get over the way I look though. Its the one thing thats holding me back.
