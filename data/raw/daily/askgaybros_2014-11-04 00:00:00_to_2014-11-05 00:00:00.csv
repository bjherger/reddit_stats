  im looking to bottom 2morrow with my friend who is decently sized and i want to make sure i have my ducks in a row. he will be bringing condoms that he likes and fits him, but i have purchased some other stuff just in case.

i also bought condoms and hopefully they work well with anal. i've used the original pjur oil and water based products and love them. im new to bottoming but i do have experience with anal toys, aneros and what not. but things are different now that it's going to be a real penis. i do have some left over jo h20 water based lube also. 

isn't there some cardinal rule about what toys or condoms to use with certain types of lube? like water based lubes can be used with ABC, and oil based lubes can be used with XYZ?

in the morning i'll shower and just warm up with my largest aneros(progasm and vice) and lube and wait until he comes over. which lube do you think would go best with the condoms below? side note, can i use oil or silicone based lubes with my progasm and vice, thus far i've just used water based stuff.

condoms:

Okamoto Beyond Seven ALOE Condoms (just read reviews, i dont knwo anything about them)

lube:

I (29, straight, genetically born female) consider myself a pretty open-minded person when it comes to relationships, sex, and even life in general; however, a moment has come where I'm facing some extremely unfamiliar territory in the relationship department. As a woman who works in the adult industry with a lot of fetish under my belt, very little bothers me -- and before I was even in this world professionally, I didn't judge and was very openly supportive of many communities, including the LGBT one. So, when my boyfriend (30, supposedly straightish male) came out to me expressing his desire to cross dress, I was so supported that a single eyelash did not flutter with worry or unpleasantness.

That was about two weeks ago, and things have gotten a bit more perplexing since then.

It doesn't help that despite being very involved with the trans community that I have never been romantically associated with it in regards to whom I've dated in the past. That makes things a bit more complicated.

About a week after the dressing conversation, he told me that for the last three-ish years he has only been in relationships with trans women, none of whom were post op. As a man who very specifically calls himself straight without even a smidge of bisexuality, this struck me as a tad odd -- but again, didn't judge, I'm okay with this even though it is a strange thing to be the first genetic female he's dated in several years. He has slept or has been in short flings with other GFs, but not an actual relationship. I told him that you can love a person as that, a person, despite the packaging, and that it makes him incredibly awesome for being okay with that. Sure, it made my mind go ""hmm"" for a moment, but more in a, ""okay, this is uncharted territory,"" way.

Last week, I went out with him while dressed, along with one of his friends and one of my own. After the second stop for the night, without warning he ditches me and my friend with an excuse he now insists was a joke (joke or not, ditching your SO whilst hanging out on a date we already arranged in advance is NOT okay, ever) saying,"" *[friend's name]* and I are going to leave and try to make cute men buy us drinks."" Even after talking with him about how that was a hugely rude move didn't seem to sink in, but after that the apprehension really started to take hold.

Two nights ago, we go out for the night, run into several friends, have fun, etc. Many of his friends (new and old) started off by telling me how happy they were to see that he was comfortable in going out as his feminine self and that his confidence was a direct result of having an understanding partner. Eventually, those same people started adding in that I need to watch my heart because for the time they've known him, he has been overcompensating in behavior to emphasize just how uber straight he was, as if he has something to prove, and that more may be coming that I need to prepare myself for. Coming from out gay men, these comments are taken very seriously, as opposed to random remarks made by people who know nothing about the crossdressing or gay community.

Same night, he doesn't go home with me, despite us having a ride from one of his very awesome friends -- perplexed both of us. Favorite quote of that ride was, ""If I were straight, your boyfriend sending a sexy woman home alone, without a real reason, after she expressed wanting him to go home with her would end up in MY bed. There is something not quite right about this."" He and I end up chatting about a few things over breakfast, and I'm dropped at home.

About 10 minutes later, I get a message: ""guess whose boyfriend has been logged into grindr after leaving her for the night?"" His profile lists him as *single*, with tribes such as *""daddy"" and *""discreet""* chosen, with a photo that I took of him the night he had ditched me previously. Since the **profile photo was taken by me**, whilst his girlfriend, he definitely had the account edited after we became a couple.

I'm direct as shit, so I asked him about it. Honestly, no good answers were given. He first tells me that he had the grindr account to find other crossdressers to use as support, then changes it to saying that the trans site he chats with his support group on (this one i 

knew about) logs him into grindr automatically when he uses it.

From what I know as a professional web nerd, grindr is 1) a standalone proprietary app, another website doesn't log you into it, and 2) it's a blaaaaaaaaatant gay hookup site. 

Seriously.

While expressing my worries that I'm not the type of person he really wants to be with and that I feel more like a comfort to him during a difficult time than a romantic partner he loves, he says that he couldn't possibly be gay, otherwise he wouldn't be able to do what he does (quite awesomely) in bed if he weren't attracted to my gender. I tried to explain that it wasn't necessarily a good excuse given many gay men can perform in the bedroom without a cock present, but he has this problem with not listening/comprehending/being rational with a counterargument. I'm not sure if part of this is a side effect of also being a diagnosed aspie or not -- but one thing I do know about people with Aspbergers is that lying is not usually in their cards.

In regards to what his friends said/showed me, he said that they were just trying to break us apart to fuck with him for whatever reason. He claimed that since the friend who showed me the grindr profile recently started seeing a trans man that this sudden taste of pussy made him magically attracted to straight-up women and that he was likely just trying to fuck me (that one made me laugh my ass off... seriously... he implied that homosexuality is easily cured by the taste of pussy).

So yeah, I honestly don't know what to do or think -- and regardless of what his true orientation may be, whether it's straight, bisexual, or gay, it is very obvious that he doesn't know either. I told him that I am not asking out of anger and that I know he isn't purposefully trying to hurt me, but that I do still deserve the right to ask questions and voice my concerns -- something he was not taking very well. He is obviously deeply confused, and I am just trying to be okay with eventually finding out that my partner is only with me to emphasize his straightness while having serious vagina envy. He's going to a shrink in a few days to talk about why he feels more comfortable as a woman than a man, so I'm hoping that they will get something more out of him than I can.

It is entirely possible that he is straight and just not handling things very clearly/well, but the longer we are together, the more I can't shake the feeling that I'm his unintentional beard. I don't want to hurt him, but I don't deserve to be hurt either.

Other than my current plan of just continuing to be supportive and open while riding this out to see where it ends up, I could really use some advice or general thoughts from people we don't know.


Honestly, it's even helpful just writing all of this out. For some reason, even though I know I shouldn't, I feel like an asshole for being upset/worried about this.

I just wish I knew how to talk with him about this more without him closing off or blowing up. I can't even give him feedback on clothing/makeup without getting my face bitten off with a growling yell of *""I KNOW how to do this, I know a lot of drag queens and trannies!""*


**TLDR:** I'm a 29-yr old genetic female whose self-proclaimed straight boyfriend (30) recently came out as a cross dresser, then told me he hasn't dated anyone but pre-op trans women for nearly 4 years (til me). His own friends warn me that my heart may get broken bc they suspect that he is hiding much more, and two nights ago he preferred to be on Grindr instead of going home with his girlfriend for a night of kickass sexual debauchery (of which we have a lot, so that works in his favor). He insists that he doesn't have a single gay bone in his body. 

WTF do I do in this wonky-as-fuck situation?

Which direction are your testicles oriented?

I have horizontally oriented testicles, meaning the long axis lies horizontally. It never really occured to me that this might me uncommon even though every text book diagram of the male reproductive system shows the testicles almost vertical.

The other day I learnt that horizontal testicles are more prone to torsion (don't look it up if you don't want to cringe) and that made me finally question just how uncommon that testicular orientation is.

Your testicles are elliptical in shape, and the length can point head to heels or back to front or angles in between.
I think it's something to do with how much the epididymis adheres to the vas deferens or something. 

So guys, in what direction do your testes lie? I'd like to know for serious surveying purposes.

  I felt like this was the best place to post this, but if anyone cares to recommend another subreddit to talk to, I will definitely cross post what i've written…

  I am 20 years old and a junior in college.  For a long time I have known that I was not the straightest person in the world but I was really not sure what to do about it.  Because of this (I think), I have always been rather quiet, sexually. I have never tried to advertise myself as a potential relationship or hookup partner (I don't work out, never intentionally hit on people...). I have been completely closeted about my sexuality until very recently, and now only a couple confidential people know that I am bisexual- none of which are family members.  Throughout my life, I have had this very strong idea in my head that I want a wife and children.  Even today, I want this. Only until recently have I really come to terms with being bisexual.  I am at a point now where I understand that my bisexuality is a part of me, and not something that I an can or should hide from.  I was wondering if there was anyone in this group that could sympathize with what I'm going through, or had any advise about dating as an open bisexual?  I've felt like it is a hinderance to finding a partner for so long, but I am at a point now where I want to be honest with myself and the world while still being able to work towards having the family that I want to have.

Hey guys, so on Friday I told my date (?) how I feel about him &amp; he feels the same way.

He initially didn't want to try out being together with me because he said he has got studies and he wants to ""be a better person"" before loving someone else.

I talked him out of it only because I had the same excuses as him before and I know what he's feeling.

But regardless our stand now is to continue going out like we do (dinner, long chats) at least until his finals are over in the beginning of December. 

Now I'm confused as to what to do. As in, besides continuing what we usually do, should anything else be different - now that we have made our feelings known to each other?

We have both never been in a relationship before so I'm sure he's just as lost, but I'd like to know more so that at least one of us can lead the other.

More specifically, when do I hold his hand, or kiss him? We are in Singapore, which recently rejected a repeal of a penal code that criminalizes consensual sex between two men, so it wouldn't be easy for us to be touchy in public.

And um, how long should we keep the status quo before we can know if we could be together? My stand is we should at least date for a few more months to see if we're compatible, and he's the same, except he was afraid we are going to be in it for real had he agreed to try things out with me (because we have been friends since July and he considers the time we spent together as friends half-dating)...

So yeah long post I know, but I really like him and I don't wanna be so lost.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL;DR - Date &amp;amp; I feel the same for each other, what next?&lt;/p&gt;
