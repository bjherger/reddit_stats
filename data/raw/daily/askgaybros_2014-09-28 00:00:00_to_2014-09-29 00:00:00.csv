Known for a while. A few friends here know, and some friends that live in another state. And I'm fine with them knowing, but none of these friends that know are in my immediate circle. 

So, most of my immediate circle and I were out at the pub on Friday. And one of them is having a chat to me. He starts on the line of questioning ""What's going on with you?"", ""Any girls about?"", ""I've never seen you with a girl."" etc., and obviously alarm bells are going off like mad in my mind, but he has sat at a table in such a way that pins me to the wall. 

Then he launches into the ""Or any guys? You know that would be fine. What are you looking for? Guys, girls, someone nice?"" part of the speech. Such an easy way to come out, right? Just say you're looking for a guy, JDuns, and then you're out. But instead, I latch onto the 'nice' comment, and then basically tell him we can discuss it later and terminate the conversation. 

So I'm about 99.9% sure he knows, but I just couldn't confirm. Which is weird, cause a few other friends have asked (after they were told by a gay acquaintance that he saw me on grindr), and I just confirmed. And when I told my interstate friends, it was when I met them. So that was fine too. But for some reason (surprise? not enough beer?) I kind of wimped out. 

And anyway, I basically spent the next 30 hours in a state of I guess a light panic. And I know I could just text this guy, but something is stopping me. And my head is all over the place on this. I won't see any of these guys for at least a couple of weekends I imagine, so I have a chance to decompress and get on the front foot with this.

So, I'm planning on traveling alone and searched a place to be without paying too much. I found couchsurfing site but after a little research I became somewhat afraid of it. I mean, first time traveling and some people seem to have only girl's reviews or only guys reviews. I don't wanna have blinddatesexcoughing around. I just want to meet someone nice to show me around. Also, Imagine that I get a mega hot but straight guy and he walks shirtless around the house (impossible not to look). Of course I will not be disrespectful in any way and won't even comment. But imagine I get caught looking , he's homophobic and throws me out. It seems so risky.

I don't want to just travel and know gay people by all means but it seems so stupid saying ""btw I'm bisexual"". It seems I'm suggesting something.

Anyone with experiences? Suggestions?

Had the typical rough high school experience, finally accepted it when I was 19, but I never moved to a more accepting place for college or after and had the chance to do much gay shit while I was young, mostly out of pathetic weakness but I was also somewhat limited due to my geographic area. Basically, it never got better. I'm out to my mother but not my father. My mother seemingly grudgingly accepted it (she is in a long term relationship with another woman so she kind of had to) but gave the impression that she'd rather I be straight. My father is too Catholic to ever be able to accept it but he'd struggle with it and try to find a way to live with it and I don't want to have to watch that. He's miserable enough already, I don't want to make it worse.

I don't really have any trouble getting guys interested in me on Grindr and similar apps. I'm not that hot but I'm sort of attractive and go to the gym a few times a week. I've had sex a few times in the past couple years and I hated it. I don't know if it's internalized homophobia but every time I've tried it I was completely disgusted with myself and just wanted to remove myself from that situation as quickly as possible. I can't really explain why but the entire experience is just really unpleasant to me except for the parts where I'm too horny to care. The guys I've hooked up with have known I was pretty inexperienced - either I told them and they were kind of confused that a fairly attractive (I hope) guy with his shit together has managed to make it this far without getting much sex or I was so awkward and nervous about it that they asked. 

Dating doesn't really feel like an option. I've tried profiles on sites like Okcupid before but never really found anyone I was remotely interested in. I don't know if it's just a matter of where I live or if my standards are too high. I don't really feel like I have anything to offer anyway. I wouldn't want a guy to ever meet my parents (even if they were both completely accepting, long story...) and I wouldn't want to be seen as publicly gay while out with a guy. I do like the idea of a relationship and there were several times I developed stupid crushes on guys who lived too far away when I was younger so I think I could find guys I was actually interested in.

Still, the thought of being in a relationship and having to live up to someone's expectations, give them sex, etc. seems really exhausting. If I really wanted a relationship I think I could probably get it but honestly the thought of dating/hooking up with the same guy long enough to get him to want to be in a relationship with me is really unappealing and right now I'd just rather keep being alone.

I'm starting to get worried because my youngest brother is probably going to get engaged soon and there have been comments from family about how weird it will be if the youngest son gets married before the oldest. Luckily my mother is pretty much indifferent (I think she'd just rather me be alone forever if I'm not going to have a ""normal"" relationship that produces grandkids for her) but my dad is pretty concerned that I'm almost 30 and haven't once mentioned a girlfriend. I don't want to be that weird foreveralone single uncle at Thanksgiving that all the ""normal"" married siblings joke about behind his back (I have a couple aunts/uncles like this).

If I AM ever going to actually live as a gay guy I feel like I need to start working on it soon whether I want to or not. I've seen what a lot of gays who had the balls to figure their shit out early, especially younger ones who don't realize how much has changed in the past 5-10 years, say about older guys who come out and have to work through things at an older age. I don't want to be that tragic aging queen in the club who never got to have any fun when he was younger and is trying too hard to make up for lost time.

I feel like, at this point, I might as well just be alone forever. I'm used to it and all I have to do is get through another few decades and then it's over. The only thing that really scares me about being alone is that it means there's not really anything to look forward to for the rest of my life. No chance of ever having kids means that once my parents are gone there's just pretty much nobody to be around for past a certain point. 

Anyway, right now I'm just trying to decide if I should just keep forcing myself to hook up and maybe go on dates until I actually like it or of that's unfair to the guys I'd be doing things with. Has anyone else had a similar experience or known anyone who came out (or at least started actually living) fairly late and ended up ok? I know I'm probably still dealing with a lot of internalized homophobia but I don't really know how to make it go away other than moving somewhere less conservative, which is a goal within the next couple years. I don't really mean to complain about how bad I have it since I know that I've got things pretty good.

Anyways, today is my Ex's birthday, and his new boyfriend is going to be at the party which I was invited too. 

For a bit of background, my ex broke up with me a few days after ruining my birthday, so the fact that this is his birthday now makes it even harder. I don't know If I should just get it over with and go, or just skip out. The nice part of me doesn't want to mess up his birthday, even though the jealous part of me would like nothing more than to point out how he ruined my birthday and return the favor. It also doesn't help that throughout our relationship he wasn't ""out"" to his friends and forced me to keep quiet about us dating and now it appears he is out and open about his relationship now. I just really don't know what to do and would really like some advice or just anyone to talk to about this.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So my ex and I decided to still be friends after breaking up, and it hasn&amp;#39;t been easy on me because I still sorta like him (he was the one that ended it), but I don&amp;#39;t want to lose him as a friend so I&amp;#39;ve been working through it. Anyways, today is my Ex&amp;#39;s birthday, and his new boyfriend is going to be at the party which I was invited too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a bit of background, my ex broke up with me a few days after ruining my birthday, so the fact that this is his birthday now makes it even harder. I don&amp;#39;t know If I should just get it over with and go, or just skip out.
