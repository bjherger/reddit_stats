From doing some research online, I found that I was right around average, if not, *slightly* above (right about 6"", cut). I had also heard the age-old adage about how ""you can't compare yourself to the dicks you see in porn because those guys are typically far from the norm, they get paid to do this *because* they have abnormally large penises, etc"", and that made sense and never bothered me much. I knew I was no King Kong down in my underwear, but I was always perfectly content. 

Fast forward through a few years of hiding out in the closet, and now I'm 24, and single for the first time since becoming open about my sexuality. I made profiles on Scruff and Grindr and began chatting with local guys, which turned into meeting a few of them who i seemed to click with. All in all, I would say I've met about 10 such guys in the last 3 months. To my surprise, when we actually meet and start getting into things, almost every single one of them has had a penis that is noticeably larger than mine (both in length and in thickness). For the first time in my life, I'm starting to feel self conscious about my penis, because it's not like these are porn stars, they're just regular local guys who are all packing more heat than me. 

Does anyone have some perspective they can offer? I know ""it's not about size, it's how you use it"", but that still doesn't help me feeling slightly inadequate every time I take off my pants in front of someone new. I don't want to feel self-conscious, but I can't help but feel like I'm getting slapped with an unexpectedly harsh dose of reality lately.

I’m an older married gay guy who went back to uni a couple of years ago for a second career. My original plan was to just keep my head down, do the work required, and not really get involved with other students since our life experiences were different and I just assumed friendships wouldn’t be a consideration due to my age (I’m 20 years older than most of them). Thing is, over the last couple of years a few friendships have developed despite the age gap, and I consider at least a couple of them to be good friendships with people whose company I enjoy.

The problem I’ve been having, especially recently, is that despite these friends telling me age is just a number, my age doesn’t matter, and whatever else, their actions speak differently. I know the friendships are valued, but when it comes to actually socializing in groups, I’m not really thought of as that kind of friend. Little things like going out for drinks in small groups, going to events, sports and whatever. At first I thought it might just be different circles of friends doing different things together, and that I’m in a different circle (a circle of one), but it has become fairly obvious that it’s my age – new people who enter my friends’ lives who are the same young age get invites to be included in social things within weeks, often to do activities that I’ve been expressing interest in for a year.

When I started uni, I didn’t feel old, because I’m not really that old. Now I do, in large part because I’m being treated like I’m old. I’ve thought about maybe pulling back from my younger friends, but I don’t want to seem like I value their friendship any less. On the other hand, I don’t really want to explain what’s going on with me and become the pity friend, either – being included in social things by force would be even worse. I know they probably don’t realize that what they say to me about my age not mattering isn’t supported by the exclusion (they probably don’t realize they’re excluding me at all), so I don’t really hold it against them. I just want to be treated like a regular friend who is worthy of hanging out and doing normal friend things in actual social settings, not as the hidden friend behind closed doors (or as a parent, which is even worse).

So, young people of /r/askgaybros, what’s your advice on how to deal with these kinds of friendships? I’m not looking to be included in dorm parties or whatnot, but it would be nice to be something other than a lone friend on my own. My instinct is to just keep quiet, pull back from them and go back to my own thing where I felt like a fun person rather than an old man, but that probably wouldn’t be fair to them – they’re good young men and women, and they’re still friends I would miss. I also understand that I have a certain perspective in this situation that they don’t, so I’m trying to be cool with everything, but it’s becoming difficult and kind of lonely. I don’t want to feel like my friendships are an embarrassment or a secret.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t really gay-specific, but since the sub is populated with mostly younger people and I’m familiar with it, I figured it would be the best place to ask for a bit of advice.&lt;/p&gt;

So today i received a text message from a random person saying my best friend( lets call him John) gave this guy my number cause he thought i needed some gay friends . First off im not out of the closet. Secondly, John is the only person i've told about my sexuality.
When i confronted John about it he responded with ""lol dude if you don't want to hang with him im sorry, and honestly this is the least of my worries""
Am i over doing it or do i have a right to be mad?

here are some of the text the gay dude sent me. ""hey... so ur friend john asked me to text you.. apparently he thinks this is the best way to hook up people""
""He said he has a gay friend i may think is hot""
""he did say you didn't have many gay friends and don't go out much""
The reason i dont go out much anymore is because i got diagnosed with type one diabetes 6 months ago and i dont drink anymore. It has nothing to do with me being gay.


i don't post much so i don't know the correct format. if you need more info just ask and i will provide it.

I know there are plenty of posts like this with people facing the same thing in life but I desperately need some sort of advice or guidance as to what to do. I'm confused and it's really starting to eat up at me. I felt coming here might help me.

The story is, about 7-6 months ago I started to crush on a guy that I'm friends with through social media. We had been following each other for a few months prior to me starting to crush on him, just by looking at his photos and how nice he seemed. We both however lives in different countries. Eventually we then followed each other on other social media, before I decided to ask him if we could be facebook friends. We kept talking about stuff we both enjoy and love to do over the days until late November I felt comfortable enough to tell him my feelings for him. (through a facebook message) My fear was that he would be freaked out or annoyed by the message but thankfully he was very sweet with his response, although at the time he didn't say how he felt about me. But since then we became closer and talked more and more about eveythting and things we enjoy. It wasn't until mid-January that he messaged me out of the blue saying that he ""has been thinking about me"". This kind of made me think that he was flirting and maybe even had feelings for me too. I talked to some friends about this and they believed he was definitely flirting but it was hard to tell if he actually genuinely liked me. (I believe he's been hurt in the past from ex-boyfriends and they say it could be a reason to why he might not be opening up entirely)
After more messaging and talking over the weeks, I decided to message him on Valentine's Day and (once again) tell him how I felt about him and make it really apparent. At this point I'm seriously crushing on this guy. Very very much so. He unfortunately said that while he thinks I'm an awesome guy, ""maybe if we lived in the same country, but I like you as a friend"".
As much as it hurt very very much I accepted it and (tried) to move on, particularly the first few days. However, about a couple weeks later he messaged me out of the blue again saying how it's been a while and ""he's been thinking about me again"". I was taken aback a little but tried not to think much of it. We just chatted and talked. However, ever since then, and up to now, he's been messaging me almost every day, sending good morning messages (from his time) or good afternoon messages, which he never used to do before this. He's also recently told me (while we were in the middle of a conversation through facebook messaging) about ""how freaking cute I looked in my last picture I uploaded"". And just to confuse me even more, he messaged me once again saying he thinks we should start texting each other now.

It's just kind of starting to really frustrate me, because I don't know if he's being just kind or possibly flirting with me? I'm confused especially since he knows how I feel about him (which I'm trying to move on but now it's extremely hard) and the last thing I would do to someone is flirt with them or give mixed signals if someone said they liked me very much, considering I didn't feel the same way.
Should I just wait this out or say something? I value our friendship very much and love having him as a friend. But I just don't know if he's being rather friendly or if he's now flirting. I need some help.

I recently went through an experimental phase where I hooked up with a guy. I've gotten past it and it has no appeal to me anymore and I'm constantly worrying about whether what I did could have given me something.

He fingered me before and after grinding. There was cum or pre-cum on his cock during the grinding and I'm worried that when he fingered me it might have entered. It's been two months since and I'm so anxious.
I would never go get tested for it because I know I'd back out. I study in the medical field and know most of the doctors in my area. Even if I didn't I don't think I'd be able to bring myself to go.

It's been two months since it happened, is there any way I can find out more about whether I have it or not? It's hard, I've got some cold and flu symptoms at the moment but everyone in my house does so that doesn't mean much to me.

First of all, can I just say that I absolutely adore this awesome sub?

Well, haha. I met a guy, ""Jacob"" on a gay website. We started texting / calling everyday for 1 month about things. Though we hadn't met, we even started calling each other ""baby"", cause we were both cute-sy and mushy like that. (feel free to vomit now. haha)

Then, Jacob invites me to a birthday party of one of his friend as his ""date"". I go.  Jacob looks great (out-of-my-league looks-wise) and he's super sweet and considerate the whole time. It's also clear he's way into me as well. (The party is the first and only time we've met so far.)

But then he asks things like, ""If we got serious, would you sleep around?"", and a few similar questions. I tell the truth: if I was serious / exclusive, then I definitely would be faithful.

We slept together that night. Then I go home in the morning. We continue to text. Then, Jacob texts ""So, are we serious (official)?"". I tell him we should talk about it in our next date, and I didn't want to rush things, mainly cause I'm super busy with college. He agrees that we should talk about it first, but it looks like he's now intensifying his sweetness / cute-sy-ness. He now texts me more often (3-4x/day). I don't mind, and he understands if I don't reply, but I still can't help thinking….

Setting aside from my heavy workload in college, I don't think I'm ready to be in another monogamous relationship yet. I really like a lot of things about Jacob, and I do want to continue dating him, but I'm not sure if I'm ready to be in a long-term commitment. I'm scared to bring this up with him, cause he's one of the sweetest people I've met in person, and I don't want to hurt his feelings. And I may even have brought this on myself by reciprocating his sweetness / mushiness (calling him ""baby"" and all). I also feel like, starting now, he expects me to be exclusive to him, though we never actually said it. (He recently texted me: ""please behave when I'm not around."")

Anyway, **(TLDR:) how can I tell this extremely sweet guy that I may not 100% ready for an exclusive relationship without hurting his feelings? I want to continue dating him though, if possible.** What's the best way to go about this? Text? In our next date? What words should I use?

I am a 19 year old sophomore in college, and I am also a closeted bisexual male. I'm pretty comfortable with this, but I have not come out to anyone yet for the main reason that I am about 85% sure most of my family would not react well to the knowledge that I'm attracted to both men and women. I think several of my friends may suspect that I'm bi, but only the ones who know me well. I'm pretty sure I don't give off that ""vibe"", not that there would be a problem if I did. 

Anyway, my college recently went on spring break, and I decided to fly home for a week (I go to school out of state). When I landed, I was told that my fraternal (not identical) twin brother had been in a serious car accident while he was driving my car. He only had a concussion, but the car was totalled. 

With my wheels completely destroyed, I found myself spending way more time in and around my house than I wanted too. Desperate to relieve the boredom I decided to download Grindr to see if maybe I could arrange a date/hookup/whatever. On my first night of chatting, I got a message from a user without a profile pic.

Being closeted and bi, my grindr profile listed only my stats, but no picture. This guy messaged me, and we start chatting. His profile said he was 18, but offered no other identifying information. We were chatting, hitting it off nicely. He said that he was a senior at the high school I graduated from two years ago, and he asked me for a face pic. We started playing a game of chicken on who was going to send the first face pic first because neither of us wanted to potentially be identified by the other. I asked him if he was in any clubs that I was part of during high school, he said no, so I decided to send him a picture of my torso with the bottom half of my face exposed. 

He shocked me when he said that he knew who I was, and he refused to send a picture of himself. I started to panic, begging him not to tell anybody because I'm not ready to be out yet. He promised he wouldn't tell anybody, but he still refused to send a picture. 

I decided to trust him, and I understood why he didn't want to show his face so I didn't pressure him on it. We kept talking throughout the night about our histories: I told him that I had been with only two men early in my freshman year of college, but I hadn't had sex in over a year. He told me he was a virgin. We kept chatting, and he told me he knew who I was because he knew my brother.

 I guess I eventually earned his trust because he sent me his face picture of his own accord and told me his name. I didn't recognize him, but he was really cute, and he said I was good looking too. We kept chatting sending pictures to each other, eventually falling asleep after sending nudes at like 4 a.m.

We kept chatting throughout the week, and I asked once or twice to hang out with him (not necessarily to hook up, but just to meet) because I was leaving later that week. He kept saying he wasn't available, or that it was an inconvenient time. We bonded over our mutual acquaintances and the fact that we were both closeted, and we talked for hours late at night throughout the week.

On Thursday evening, I asked him flat-out if he thought we would be able to meet at all before my plane left on Sunday. He said that he really wanted to, but he just wasn't psychologically ready to do anything with another man. I said I understood completely and eventually, we went to bed. On Friday night, I was once again making the rounds on Grindr trying to arrange something. I had given up hope and had literally fallen asleep for ten minutes when I was woken up by a message from him (he wasn't on at all the entire night). It was about 3 a.m. and I started talking to him about how the break didn't turn out as planned because of the car and everything, but I was grateful I made a connection with him. 

In some magnificent stroke of luck, genius, or arousal, he sent me a nude talking about how horny just me talking to him was making him. We had never talked like this to each other, and I so I was obviously excited. We talked dirty for a long time, and I broached the subject of meeting on Saturday, my last full day at home. He seemed very open to meeting and/or hooking up, but he wasn't able to host, and neither was I. I offered to pick him up in my dad's car (I was given permission to use it that day), but he understandably said that he didn't want his first time with another guy to be in the backseat of a car. 

Then by another stroke of luck, genius, or arousal, he immediately followed that up with a proposal that when I come back for summer break, we could meet at his house when there would be a lot more privacy. He asked me if I could be his first. I was so taken aback, and at the same time reassured that he was into me. I of course said that was a great idea. We talked for a long time after that about what it would be like, and we eventually went to bed.

The next day, he didn't get on Grindr at all. I had sent him a message after I woke up on Saturday morning saying that I was planning on deleting the app before I got on the plane the next day because I didn't want any gay acquaintances at college to know I was bi. I also sent him my phone number saying that if he ever wanted to talk while I was away, he could just text me and we could talk. I also friended him on facebook.

He accepted my friend request the next day (Sunday) right as I was getting on the plane, but he has not messaged me back on facebook, or texted me on my phone, even to just acknowledge the fact that he got my message for my phone number. I sent him a facebook message with my phone number after he accepted the friend request, just in case he didn't read the message on grindr before I deleted the app. 

It's now Monday evening, and still no word from him. I know it sounds kind of obsessive, naive, and stupid, but I have not been able to stop thinking about him since our last talk, when he asked me to be his first. That talk happened on Friday, 3 days ago. The only indication that he's even open to keep talking while I'm away at college was the friend acceptance on Sunday. 

This is honestly the first time I think I've ever felt romantic feelings toward a man, something I thought I would never feel. The two men I've been with were drunken hookups from college parties that had no intimacy, and honestly turned me off from men for about a year and a half. This guy means a lot to me despite the fact that we've known each other for exactly a week. I don't know what to do. Should I send him another facebook message and risk seeming obsessive and stalkerish? Or should I try texting him because by some lucky chance, he's one of the few people to list his cell phone number in his facebook profile? Or should I simply calm down, let him take his time, and wait? I think that a simple confirmation from him that he got the message would ease my tensions right now, but I don't want to risk seeming obsessive, and I definitely don't want to risk invading his privacy, or put him at risk for being outed to his family or friends, which is something he told me he is very fearful of, even more fearful than I am.

I apologize for the extremely long length of this post. Any and all advice is greatly appreciated. This is my first time actually posting anything on any of the gay subs I frequent, so this is a big step for me in becoming comfortable with my identity.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before I launch into this story, let me first give you an idea of my own personal situation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a 19 year old sophomore in college, and I am also a closeted bisexual male. I&amp;#39;m pretty comfortable with this, but I have not come out to anyone yet for the main reason that I am about 85% sure most of my family would not react well to the knowledge that I&amp;#39;m attracted to both men and women. I think several of my friends may suspect that I&amp;#39;m bi, but only the ones who know me well. I&amp;#39;m pretty sure I don&amp;#39;t give off that &amp;quot;vibe&amp;quot;, not that there would be a problem if I did. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, my college recently went on spring break, and I decided to fly home for a week (I go to school out of state). When I landed, I was told that my fraternal (not identical) twin brother had been in a serious car accident while he was driving my car. He only had a concussion, but the car was totalled. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With my wheels completely destroyed, I found myself spending way more time in and around my house than I wanted too. Desperate to relieve the boredom I decided to download Grindr to see if maybe I could arrange a date/hookup/whatever. On my first night of chatting, I got a message from a user without a profile pic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being closeted and bi, my grindr profile listed only my stats, but no picture. This guy messaged me, and we start chatting. His profile said he was 18, but offered no other identifying information. We were chatting, hitting it off nicely. He said that he was a senior at the high school I graduated from two years ago, and he asked me for a face pic. We started playing a game of chicken on who was going to send the first face pic first because neither of us wanted to potentially be identified by the other. I asked him if he was in any clubs that I was part of during high school, he said no, so I decided to send him a picture of my torso with the bottom half of my face exposed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He shocked me when he said that he knew who I was, and he refused to send a picture of himself. I started to panic, begging him not to tell anybody because I&amp;#39;m not ready to be out yet. He promised he wouldn&amp;#39;t tell anybody, but he still refused to send a picture. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to trust him, and I understood why he didn&amp;#39;t want to show his face so I didn&amp;#39;t pressure him on it. We kept talking throughout the night about our histories: I told him that I had been with only two men early in my freshman year of college, but I hadn&amp;#39;t had sex in over a year. He told me he was a virgin. We kept chatting, and he told me he knew who I was because he knew my brother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess I eventually earned his trust because he sent me his face picture of his own accord and told me his name. I didn&amp;#39;t recognize him, but he was really cute, and he said I was good looking too. We kept chatting sending pictures to each other, eventually falling asleep after sending nudes at like 4 a.m.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We kept chatting throughout the week, and I asked once or twice to hang out with him (not necessarily to hook up, but just to meet) because I was leaving later that week. He kept saying he wasn&amp;#39;t available, or that it was an inconvenient time. We bonded over our mutual acquaintances and the fact that we were both closeted, and we talked for hours late at night throughout the week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Thursday evening, I asked him flat-out if he thought we would be able to meet at all before my plane left on Sunday. He said that he really wanted to, but he just wasn&amp;#39;t psychologically ready to do anything with another man. I said I understood completely and eventually, we went to bed. On Friday night, I was once again making the rounds on Grindr trying to arrange something. I had given up hope and had literally fallen asleep for ten minutes when I was woken up by a message from him (he wasn&amp;#39;t on at all the entire night). It was about 3 a.m. and I started talking to him about how the break didn&amp;#39;t turn out as planned because of the car and everything, but I was grateful I made a connection with him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some magnificent stroke of luck, genius, or arousal, he sent me a nude talking about how horny just me talking to him was making him. We had never talked like this to each other, and I so I was obviously excited. We talked dirty for a long time, and I broached the subject of meeting on Saturday, my last full day at home. He seemed very open to meeting and/or hooking up, but he wasn&amp;#39;t able to host, and neither was I. I offered to pick him up in my dad&amp;#39;s car (I was given permission to use it that day), but he understandably said that he didn&amp;#39;t want his first time with another guy to be in the backseat of a car. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then by another stroke of luck, genius, or arousal, he immediately followed that up with a proposal that when I come back for summer break, we could meet at his house when there would be a lot more privacy. He asked me if I could be his first. I was so taken aback, and at the same time reassured that he was into me. I of course said that was a great idea. We talked for a long time after that about what it would be like, and we eventually went to bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day, he didn&amp;#39;t get on Grindr at all. I had sent him a message after I woke up on Saturday morning saying that I was planning on deleting the app before I got on the plane the next day because I didn&amp;#39;t want any gay acquaintances at college to know I was bi. I also sent him my phone number saying that if he ever wanted to talk while I was away, he could just text me and we could talk. I also friended him on facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He accepted my friend request the next day (Sunday) right as I was getting on the plane, but he has not messaged me back on facebook, or texted me on my phone, even to just acknowledge the fact that he got my message for my phone number. I sent him a facebook message with my phone number after he accepted the friend request, just in case he didn&amp;#39;t read the message on grindr before I deleted the app. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s now Monday evening, and still no word from him. I know it sounds kind of obsessive, naive, and stupid, but I have not been able to stop thinking about him since our last talk, when he asked me to be his first. That talk happened on Friday, 3 days ago. The only indication that he&amp;#39;s even open to keep talking while I&amp;#39;m away at college was the friend acceptance on Sunday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is honestly the first time I think I&amp;#39;ve ever felt romantic feelings toward a man, something I thought I would never feel. The two men I&amp;#39;ve been with were drunken hookups from college parties that had no intimacy, and honestly turned me off from men for about a year and a half. This guy means a lot to me despite the fact that we&amp;#39;ve known each other for exactly a week. I don&amp;#39;t know what to do. Should I send him another facebook message and risk seeming obsessive and stalkerish? Or should I try texting him because by some lucky chance, he&amp;#39;s one of the few people to list his cell phone number in his facebook profile? Or should I simply calm down, let him take his time, and wait? I think that a simple confirmation from him that he got the message would ease my tensions right now, but I don&amp;#39;t want to risk seeming obsessive, and I definitely don&amp;#39;t want to risk invading his privacy, or put him at risk for being outed to his family or friends, which is something he told me he is very fearful of, even more fearful than I am.&lt;/p&gt;

So I've basically noticed that i have this awful habit of being and staying super interested in people where things didn't necessarily work out. There are two guys that I've relatively recently gone on dates with, and things seemingly went great on all the dates I went on, but for one reason or another, things didn't work out. I honestly don't know why though, because they were the ones suggesting all the subsequent dates and whatnot.

On the same wavelength, I've also noticed trends where I'll lose interest when someone is interested in me. I was talking to a guy over the summer who told me that he didn't want to date me long distance (we were like an hour and a half away) and found someone else to date. I told him I wasn't gonna be his backup plan, and when his relationship didn't work out when we went back to school, I was just really uninterested.

Both of these scenarios seem to have applicable reasons why I'd act the way that I do. However, I feel like these are general trends that I've observed with my past history (or lack thereof) of dating. Is this just me being immature? Or are these actually caused by a lack of closure and from being someone's ""backup plan""?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey Bros!&lt;/p&gt;

I met a guy in the silverdaddies chatroom back in late 2009 - I was 19 then, he was 43. At the time I lived in SoCal and he lived in the Midwest so we couldn't meet. It started off casual and we probably chatted there for a day or two before we added each other on Yahoo messenger. On messenger we would chat regularly, almost 3/4 times a week and each time we did, we talked for about 2/3 hours. Eventually after a few weeks, I got comfortable with him and we would both turn on our cams to actually talk, sometimes we would actually get naked and have fun. After getting to know him and realizing he was a nice guy we exchanged phone numbers and would text a bit.
Now, during the times we chatted there was lots of flirting and just lots of regular chatting. It got to the point where I would look forward to talking to him. It kind of became a regular thing. We chatted for about 7-8 months and got to know each other pretty well. Finally, in mid-2010 my family was going on vacation without me (I forgot the reason why I didn't go). Now, during one of our chats I must have brought it up and he said that if I wanted to, he could fly to SoCal and we could finally meet. I said sure. So finally after talking and chatting and camming for 8 months, he flew in, I picked him up, and drove to his hotel. There we finally had ""sex."" Like I said, I was a virgin and we tried to have sex, but it was too painful so we stopped. We only sucked and kissed. He made me cum twice that weekend and I unfortunately, didn't make him cum. It sounds really selfish now that I type that out.


During that time we were together, we laid in bed naked just talking and fooling around and I fell asleep on his chest while he held me. It was one of the best experiences of my life. The time finally came for him to leave so he packed and I drove him to the airport. He flew out and Im pretty sure I had fallen for him over that weekend even though I wasn't aware of it. After that weekend, we chatted online a little less but still texted. This is where things got weird. In early 2011 he kind of just stopped talking to me. He stopped signing in to messenger and he stopped texting. I sent a couple of emails at first to see if anything was wrong, because like I mentioned, we used to talk regularly and it was unorthodox. Finally he replied, but it was a distant and short written response.


The next few weeks I kept signing on messenger to chat with him but he wasn't there anymore. He stopped signing in - or maybe he put me on invisible, I don't know. I sent another e-mail, but he replied late, again distant and short written. At this point I figured he didn't want to talk to me anymore and I felt pretty damn terrible. I stopped emailing him for weeks to the point where we would only talk to each other once every 1.5 months. This messed me up because we went from talking all the time to once every few weeks. I felt like I lost a friend and I didn't know why. Even worse, at this point I'm sure I liked him. I was scared to pressure him because I didn't want him to think I was clingy therefore causing him to never talk to me again. So I played the game and we continued to talk every couple of months.


Still 2011: The last time I had heard from him was probably August or September, then as I was just getting over him, he emailed me for Christmas. All my feelings came rushing back. Before, I was angry and sad because he cut me off so easily when I thought our friendship was so great. I guess it meant more to me than him. I finally mustered up the courage to tell him I liked him in early 2012 - through email. I know what you're thinking, thats extremely childish and immature, but I was so young and naive and we had grown apart, only talking 5/6 times in all of 2011. I was scared to talk to him so I sent him an email telling him how I felt. He said, he kind of figured it out and didn't want a relationship so we decided to be friends. Here, I misinterpreted his response.


I thought that by him not wanting a relationship, he meant not at that time in specific. Some part of me believed that he would eventually want one and I would wait. That was a mistake. We stopped talking from Jan/Feb 2012 to mid-2012 (July/August maybe) and I worked through my feelings trying to move on until I suppressed them enough to stop bothering me. The next part is weird too. From mid 2012, he started talking to me again, texting more regularly than before, but not as frequently as when we first chatted. I was happy again and ignored the reason as to why he would just come back into my life again. I didn't want to ask because again, I was afraid to lose him.


This kind of went on from mid-2012 to mid-2014 (July) until he visited SoCal again, but this time for personal reasons. This was the first time I saw him again in person since we met for sex. We got together one day on his trip, as friends, and attended a baseball game. We just talked and kept it casual - no flirting, no sex talk, no funny business, nothing inappropriate. In August of 2014 I moved to college in the Midwest and we hung out again, but this time at an amusement park, again as friends. We stayed in the same room at a hotel, but separate beds. Everything was casual. Over the past few months Ive gone over to his place to hang out and it's always been non-sexual, however he did mention once that he checked out my ass.


Now after hanging out with him in person these past several months, I realize my feelings for him are still there. I thought I had worked through them years ago and now they are back. Should I tell him how I feel in person? Should I cut my loses and tell him I need space and stop talking to him? Should I drop hints/flirt and see if he reciprocates? My only issue is that I think I know he doesn't like me romantically. He tells me when he thinks some guy is cute. That sounds like a red flag! A coupe of days ago he told me he might be meeting someone this week for sex - punch to the gut! I mean to me that sounds like he doesn't see me as a potential partner. One more bit of info - we both have grindr and when I was with him, his profile said he was looking for ""dates, networking, right now."" I know it sounds like Im reaching and its probably wishful thinking, but seeing dates on there made me feel like I have a chance. We've gone to lunch/dinner, basketball games, the movies, and just hung out while I visited. At this point I'd be comfortable with him telling me he doesn't like me, even though I wouldn't want that, just as long as I can move on. Im not sure what's going on anymore except how I feel about him. I want to move forward and I don't know how to best approach this situation.

Finally he replied, but it was a distant and short written response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next few weeks I kept signing on messenger to chat with him but he wasn&amp;#39;t there anymore. He stopped signing in - or maybe he put me on invisible, I don&amp;#39;t know. I sent another e-mail, but he replied late, again distant and short written. At this point I figured he didn&amp;#39;t want to talk to me anymore and I felt pretty damn terrible. I stopped emailing him for weeks to the point where we would only talk to each other once every 1.5 months. This messed me up because we went from talking all the time to once every few weeks. I felt like I lost a friend and I didn&amp;#39;t know why. Even worse, at this point I&amp;#39;m sure I liked him. I was scared to pressure him because I didn&amp;#39;t want him to think I was clingy therefore causing him to never talk to me again. So I played the game and we continued to talk every couple of months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still 2011: The last time I had heard from him was probably August or September, then as I was just getting over him, he emailed me for Christmas. All my feelings came rushing back. Before, I was angry and sad because he cut me off so easily when I thought our friendship was so great. I guess it meant more to me than him. I finally mustered up the courage to tell him I liked him in early 2012 - through email. I know what you&amp;#39;re thinking, thats extremely childish and immature, but I was so young and naive and we had grown apart, only talking 5/6 times in all of 2011. I was scared to talk to him so I sent him an email telling him how I felt. He said, he kind of figured it out and didn&amp;#39;t want a relationship so we decided to be friends. Here, I misinterpreted his response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought that by him not wanting a relationship, he meant not at that time in specific. Some part of me believed that he would eventually want one and I would wait. That was a mistake. We stopped talking from Jan/Feb 2012 to mid-2012 (July/August maybe) and I worked through my feelings trying to move on until I suppressed them enough to stop bothering me. The next part is weird too. From mid 2012, he started talking to me again, texting more regularly than before, but not as frequently as when we first chatted. I was happy again and ignored the reason as to why he would just come back into my life again. I didn&amp;#39;t want to ask because again, I was afraid to lose him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This kind of went on from mid-2012 to mid-2014 (July) until he visited SoCal again, but this time for personal reasons. This was the first time I saw him again in person since we met for sex. We got together one day on his trip, as friends, and attended a baseball game. We just talked and kept it casual - no flirting, no sex talk, no funny business, nothing inappropriate. In August of 2014 I moved to college in the Midwest and we hung out again, but this time at an amusement park, again as friends. We stayed in the same room at a hotel, but separate beds. Everything was casual. Over the past few months Ive gone over to his place to hang out and it&amp;#39;s always been non-sexual, however he did mention once that he checked out my ass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now after hanging out with him in person these past several months, I realize my feelings for him are still there. I thought I had worked through them years ago and now they are back. Should I tell him how I feel in person? Should I cut my loses and tell him I need space and stop talking to him? Should I drop hints/flirt and see if he reciprocates? My only issue is that I think I know he doesn&amp;#39;t like me romantically. He tells me when he thinks some guy is cute. That sounds like a red flag! A coupe of days ago he told me he might be meeting someone this week for sex - punch to the gut! I mean to me that sounds like he doesn&amp;#39;t see me as a potential partner. One more bit of info - we both have grindr and when I was with him, his profile said he was looking for &amp;quot;dates, networking, right now.&amp;quot; I know it sounds like Im reaching and its probably wishful thinking, but seeing dates on there made me feel like I have a chance. We&amp;#39;ve gone to lunch/dinner, basketball games, the movies, and just hung out while I visited. At this point I&amp;#39;d be comfortable with him telling me he doesn&amp;#39;t like me, even though I wouldn&amp;#39;t want that, just as long as I can move on. Im not sure what&amp;#39;s going on anymore except how I feel about him. I want to move forward and I don&amp;#39;t know how to best approach this situation.
Advice?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point Im 24 and we text about once/twice a week to keep up.&lt;/p&gt;

I have had issues with acne all of my life, but it comes and goes. Never have I had issues with my face, which I'm grateful for; however, I've had terrible issues on my shoulders, back of my thighs (near my butt), and on my butt. It's left bad scarring that is this deep purple color which has faded some over time. It's incredibly embarrassing which is why I made a throwaway to post here. People's attitude toward acne online and in person seems to be ""that's so gross! eww!"" so naturally it is the LAST thing I'd ever want to be vulnerable about.

I finally got over my embarrassment today to go to the doctor and have it checked out (I've been self-medicating at home with PanOxyl 10% bar which is great at stopping little spots but does nothing for the cysts and stuff). He was great and helpful. He's putting me on doxycycline, an antibiotic, 50mg/day low dose for basically the foreseeable future, which I'm okay with. He said cystic acne is a chronic, life-long condition related to immune function and my genetics/family history.

The pills will make me very sensitive to the sun and I am usually at the beach from April thru September... so it's going to make life hard. But I can deal with it. And they're a little expensive, but I have money so I can pay for it and I'm happy to do so. That isn't my struggle.

At one point he looked at me and said ""You know, you're just one of those cystic acne guys. You're gonna deal with this for all of your life. You'll have flare ups and remissions, but it'll always come back and medication is no guarantee. Plus, you can't be on antibiotics forever."" And he shook my hand and left the room after dropping a script for me. I've never had a chronic health issue in my life and hearing this just felt like a punch to the gut. I am feeling very depressed and absolutely hopeless.

My acne has made me feel completely horrid about myself, although no one would know that from the outside. My face is cute and I have a good body that's in shape and athletic. People have told me repeatedly that I am pretty good looking, and a guy recently said I was ""prime real estate"" -- but that's only because he saw my face, chest, and stomach, not my back side. Many guys I've dated love my ass and say it looks amazing, and I agree... when clothed. They've never seen it naked. I am not overly consumed with looks, but I do think health is important and the idea of smooth skin is so important to me. In fact, because of my issues with myself, I tend to gravitate toward guys with nice skin, but then I come to resent them for it, too. I look over at them and think ""fuck you!"" because it's so effortless for them and I work so hard and still look awful.

I just wanted to post here I guess to share how sad and frustrated I am. The scarring is the worst on my butt and second worst on the backs of my thighs, which makes me want to always be covered up in that area. If I want to meet a guy for some fun or a hookup, I tell him I only like giving oral, not because I don't want to receive but because I don't want to expose that area of myself. It comes off weird and guys often ask why I don't wanna do more. This has limited me for years and years sexually.

My scarring gets lighter over the months, but soon a new bump comes and leaves a new scar and it just shatters me. When the doctor said his comment I mentioned above, it just made me think I'll always be disgusting and this will never get better, or if it does it'll only be short lived and it will come raging back worse than ever.

Has anyone gone through this? Any words of comfort or advice? No one knows I struggle with this, so I am very alone with it as I have been for many years. My mom has cystic acne too, but this is not the thing I wanna talk to my mom about.

&lt;p&gt;We went to different universities but have recently started dating now that we&amp;#39;ve graduated.  It&amp;#39;s funny because we&amp;#39;ve known each other for such a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any similar experiences?&lt;/p&gt;
