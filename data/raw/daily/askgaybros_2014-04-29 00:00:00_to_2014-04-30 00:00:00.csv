He's masculine , dominant, wealthy, romantic, sexy, goal-driven, loving, philanthropic...and I don't see anything wrong with out relationship. He is 32 and I am 25 now. I met him when I was 21 and studying abroad before senior year of college and our love is real. Now, my friends are concerned about a few things...for one thing, they were pissed I signed a prenup. I didn't hesitate to. They said ""he should know you love him and why is he already thinking about divorcing?"" but I didn't see it that way. I am realistic and although I enjoy our lifestyle, I'm not with him to make bank (I have my own 9-5 job).  
  
Anyway, he's definitely the one who wears the pants. He's a total top and I'm a total bottom and apart from that, he's just a naturally dominant and aggressive guy. Our relationship has a sort of contract though, which is the other reason why my friends think he's abusive. We have a love contract. I'm supposed to give into his every sexual need and, once married, I'm to quit my job because we are adopting children. We don't want a nanny or anything. I'm also required to cook dinner every night except for when we have other plans. I'm in charge of all housework as well. Also, I'm not allowed to go clubbing or to bars without him, which doesn't bother me at all. (PS the sexual and household demands aren't enforced if I'm ill or anything.) Breaking these demands nulls my prenup settlement, as well as infidelity.  
  
So, yes, he has a great deal of control over my life...but in these five years he's never hit me or put me down, so I don't see how this is abusive? My friends are constantly nagging though and it's pushing us apart. Am I in the wrong? I'm allowed to work whatever job I want until we adopt, the sex he demands is fucking hot, I can hang out with whoever (just not wherever), I can wear what I want, I have separate hobbies, he doesn't mind when I'm hanging out with other gay guys and never gets jealous.  
  
So I don't know...am I missing something here? I enjoy having this kind of control over me and don't find it demeaning. He doesn't hurt me physically or call me names or cut me off from people. When we argue, we literally go through this stupid process of no yelling, no personal insults, and we use ""I statements"" lol. He's only gotten extremely angry at me once or twice and he just goes to bed and reads/does finance stuff for a couple hours and then gives it to me extra hard that night.

I should preface this with the fact that I'm 27 and my boyfriend is -- let's call him Jay -- 25.  He's just the second person I've ever had sex with, while he's more... experienced.  I'm a versatile top.  He's pretty much a bottom and has only bottomed with me (as in he's never been the top with me, but he's bottomed before).  I'm trying to learn how to be a better top, and hence the asking for advice.  :)
 
Jay and I have been going out for about 2 and a half months.  We've had the DTR conversation, and we seem to be on the same page about where we're going.  We have a super active sex life, although somewhat punctuated.  We maybe only see each other once or twice a week (max), but we end up having sex each time we do (at least twice).  That part may be just a humble brag.  But I say it to say that mismatched libidos is not an issue; if anything, he's hornier than I am.  

When it comes to most aspects, it's been pretty great.  However, Jay  always bottoms when it comes to anal.  This is his decision as much as anything.  However, when it comes to it I just can't keep him  hard.  It doesn't seem to matter how slowly we start or how much foreplay we do or how hard he was to start with.  Once I get inside him, he just goes soft.  It's not that it's painful for him, or that he doesn't enjoy it (he does).  He just can't seem to maintain his erection.

Jay hasn't expressed concern about this, and dismissed it as a concern when I asked him about it.  He's said I'm thicker than he's used to (another humble brag) but I've tried things like fingering him to try 'opening him up' more, but that doesn't seem to make any difference.  We always both get off, so it's not a concern about that.  I just want to make sure I'm being a good top for him, and that he's having as good a time in bed as I do.  Like I said above, he's only the second guy I've ever been with, so I don't have a lot to compare it to.  However. the first guy I was with was not only able to stay hard while bottoming, he was able to cum while doing it.  Which is totally hot, and kind of what is motivating me right now.  Haha.

So, my issue is, what are some things I can do to try to keep him hard while he's bottoming?  Or, are there some guys that just can't keep an erection while on bottom?  I'm kind of fishing for advice here; I don't *really* know what I'm looking for.

I have been sexually attracted to men since I could first masturbate, and i'm not sexually attracted to women. I've never kissed either gender, or had sex with anyone. Now that i'm in college I see so many good looking people, but I always focus on the guys. I could accept myself if I KNEW was gay both sexually and romantically, but I don't know. I love the thought of having sex with a man, but I don't know that I would want a relationship. In fact, I feel that I would rather have a romantic relationship with a women. Apart of me thinks this is because seeing straight relationships is what I have always seen, and maybe if I found the right guy I would want to have a relationship with him. Maybe there is a woman that could satisfy my romantic and sexual desires. I am quite confused.

With that being said, I have a gay roommate, and I have been considering telling him that i'm sexually attracted to men. I'm confident he would accept me, but I don't know how it would change our relationship, I don't want to lose his friendship (he might think i'm into him if I tell him, which to be honest I would probably have sex with him, but I would never bring that up - having sex with a friend is not a good idea, I know). Should I tell him?
","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a 21 year old male. I&amp;#39;ll start off by saying that I don&amp;#39;t hate myself, and I don&amp;#39;t think i&amp;#39;m depressed. I&amp;#39;m not sure of who I am and what i&amp;#39;m attracted to. I have been sexually attracted to men since I could first masturbate, and i&amp;#39;m not sexually attracted to women. I&amp;#39;ve never kissed either gender, or had sex with anyone. Now that i&amp;#39;m in college I see so many good looking people, but I always focus on the guys. I could accept myself if I KNEW was gay both sexually and romantically, but I don&amp;#39;t know. I love the thought of having sex with a man, but I don&amp;#39;t know that I would want a relationship. In fact, I feel that I would rather have a romantic relationship with a women. Apart of me thinks this is because seeing straight relationships is what I have always seen, and maybe if I found the right guy I would want to have a relationship with him. Maybe there is a woman that could satisfy my romantic and sexual desires. I am quite confused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that being said, I have a gay roommate, and I have been considering telling him that i&amp;#39;m sexually attracted to men. I&amp;#39;m confident he would accept me, but I don&amp;#39;t know how it would change our relationship, I don&amp;#39;t want to lose his friendship (he might think i&amp;#39;m into him if I tell him, which to be honest I would probably have sex with him, but I would never bring that up - having sex with a friend is not a good idea, I know). Should I tell him?&lt;/p&gt;
