This is just an incredibly sensitive topic for trans people, and I feel like even asking this is breaking some sort of weird code. I don't need backlash.

I'm FTM. Pre-op, pre-everything but T right now because of a chronic illness. When you're worried about life threatening things, dysphoria really takes a back seat. But once I've got my life somewhat more stable, I plan on transitioning fully. However with bottom surgery right now I'm not sure how comfortable I feel seeing as how over 90% of the pictures I've seen I'm not happy with, method wise. :/

I'm rambling, sorry. I guess my question is...how do gay guys feel about FTM trans guys? Be honest with me. It's the reason I got a throwaway. I don't want to be fooling myself. I know I'm in the minority here but I'm a pretty chill guy, and I'd rather someone be honest and say ""Yeah, I'd probably be looking at you like a woman, despite the beard and chest hair."" I know it's highly subjective and that not every gay guy is of the same mind, so if you've got stories that aren't your own or things you've been witness to, please feel free to share too.

I'm fine with bottoming, topping, love anal, giving or receiving, so sexual positioning isn't an issue for me, and if I trust that the guy isn't just a ""tranny chaser"" I'm fine with PIV sex too, and I've been told by guys its different from your usual PIV sex because, well, I've got a mini dick too! ;) So...if you're being honest, does trans genitalia turn you off to the point that it doesn't matter what the trans guy is like? Or is it something that wouldn't be that big of an issue as long as you're into the guy himself? Most trans guys just look like guys, but we've got some different genitalia down there. Not exactly female, and not exactly male. (On the off chance you guys haven't seen trans male parts, check out /r/FTMPorn for some decently classy ""dick pics"".)

Note: Please try and stay classy. Ideally I'd love for this to be something questioning trans guys can stumble on and be able to read honest, unvarnished opinions. If you say ""Hey man, I really don't dig trans guys, sorry"", please give the reason why, and I'll still respect you in the morning, I promise.

Edit: Ugh I can't believe I used ""real talk"" in my title. Gag. Mentally change that to ""Be honest"" please. Also, if you're uncomfortable being brutally honest on your regular account, make a throwaway. Stay respectful please, but I'd rather someone answer than have silence.

I know I&amp;#39;m in the minority here but I&amp;#39;m a pretty chill guy, and I&amp;#39;d rather someone be honest and say &amp;quot;Yeah, I&amp;#39;d probably be looking at you like a woman, despite the beard and chest hair.&amp;quot; I know it&amp;#39;s highly subjective and that not every gay guy is of the same mind, so if you&amp;#39;ve got stories that aren&amp;#39;t your own or things you&amp;#39;ve been witness to, please feel free to share too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m fine with bottoming, topping, love anal, giving or receiving, so sexual positioning isn&amp;#39;t an issue for me, and if I trust that the guy isn&amp;#39;t just a &amp;quot;tranny chaser&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;m fine with PIV sex too, and I&amp;#39;ve been told by guys its different from your usual PIV sex because, well, I&amp;#39;ve got a mini dick too! ;) So...if you&amp;#39;re being honest, does trans genitalia turn you off to the point that it doesn&amp;#39;t matter what the trans guy is like? Or is it something that wouldn&amp;#39;t be that big of an issue as long as you&amp;#39;re into the guy himself? Most trans guys just look like guys, but we&amp;#39;ve got some different genitalia down there. Not exactly female, and not exactly male. (On the off chance you guys haven&amp;#39;t seen trans male parts, check out &lt;a href=""/r/FTMPorn""&gt;/r/FTMPorn&lt;/a&gt; for some decently classy &amp;quot;dick pics&amp;quot;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: Please try and stay classy. Ideally I&amp;#39;d love for this to be something questioning trans guys can stumble on and be able to read honest, unvarnished opinions. If you say &amp;quot;Hey man, I really don&amp;#39;t dig trans guys, sorry&amp;quot;, please give the reason why, and I&amp;#39;ll still respect you in the morning, I promise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Ugh I can&amp;#39;t believe I used &amp;quot;real talk&amp;quot; in my title. Gag. Mentally change that to &amp;quot;Be honest&amp;quot; please. Also, if you&amp;#39;re uncomfortable being brutally honest on your regular account, make a throwaway. Stay respectful please, but I&amp;#39;d rather someone answer than have silence. This subreddit is full of cool guys though, I&amp;#39;m asking you all for a reason! ;)&lt;/p&gt;

I'm really sorry for it being extremely long, so there's a tl;dr at the end for your reading pleasure.  I'm not entirely sure if this is the right sub to post to, but I'll give it a shot.  
So this post is about the relationship I was in and how it just ended.  I'm just wondering if his reasoning for breaking it off is justified or if it’s an overreaction on his part and I'm asking you guys for your opinion.

Some background info before the actual stuff about my break-up.  I have a friend, let’s call him Nick. Nick is 21.  We became friends a couple months ago when I moved to university.  Nick's gay and our friendship quickly became something beyond just friends.  The thing is, I soon realized I didn't like Nick like that and would rather just be friends, which he totally understood and said he felt the same way.  This was a good three months ago.  We've been great friends ever since.  

Now, the guy I was seeing, let’s call him Alex, and I went out on Saturday.  We hung out at my dorm, watched some TV, and talked.  During this time, I got two texts from Nick asking if I was on campus (cause I sometimes go home on the weekends seeing that I live not too far from the uni) and then if I wanted to hang out.  I didn't answer his texts cause I didn't want to seem rude by texting while being with Alex. He then sent me a third text saying how he forgot I had told him I was on a date tonight and he apologized.  Alex saw me read the texts and asked who it was.  I, not thinking it would be of any problem what-so-ever, said it was my friend Nick and then proceeded to explain how I met him and basically everything I just explained above pertaining to my history with Nick.  In hindsight, it was probably not my best move bringing up past hookups, but Alex had done the same on an earlier date, so I didn't think twice of it.  We then left for dinner.  We had a great time at dinner and Alex dropped me back off at my dorm because he had to get to one of his friend’s birthday parties, which I politely declined going to and which he understood.  Back to the break-up.
I started seeing Alex two weeks ago.  He's the first guy that I would say I have been in a true ""relationship"", granted only for two weeks.  It was great.  He liked the same things as me, we texted each other constantly, we talked on the phone for hours, and he even surprised me by coming to my dorm after I got back from my late night chem exam.  One thing he did not like was Nick, but I didn't know that until it was too late.  

Fast forward to the next day. I wake up and text Alex.  We talk for a bit, until I get a text from Nick asking if I wanted to hang out.  I said sure and he said he'd be over in in 10 minutes.  I told Alex I was going to go take a shower because I was going to hang out with a friend.  I take a shower, I hang out with Nick, and now, after Nick has left, I text Alex back.  This is where things start to go downhill.  He asks what I've been up to and I say I hung out with Nick. I asked him how the party was, which then got me a rather simple, and obviously passive-aggressive remark.  He sounded annoyed so I ask him if he was mad about something.  He then goes on to say how he “doesn't get why I hang out with him [Nick]”. He asks why I would text him when with my other friend, let’s call her Rebecca, but when I was with Nick I ""couldn't even text once"".  So the conversation has now jumped back to Nick and I'm kind of blind-sided by it. I didn't really know how to respond.  I go on to explain that because I've known Rebecca for a long time, us hanging out usually consisted of sitting around and doing whatever, while periodically on our phones and what not.  But with Nick, I'm usually talking about something like some show he likes and the actors in it, or I'm showing him some video on YouTube, what-have-you. Plus, on this occasion, I had gone out to lunch at an on-campus cafe with Nick because I was hungry.  Alex goes on to say that he “does not like that.”, that I'm entitled to talk to whoever I want, and that he needed some time to think about things.  I had no clue why he was saying this cause he never showed any displeasure in Nick when I mentioned him the previous evening. I knew what he was talking about and where he was coming from, but I still asked him what he ""didn't like"".  He states that he doesn't like it when I hang out with Nick because it makes him feel uncomfortable.  He then mentions how Nick was ""blowing up"" my phone during our date.  He goes on to say that it makes him uncomfortable because he feels that ""anything could happen.” I've now fully grasped what the issue was and I thought I was going to be able to fix it right then and there.  I didn't think the situation was a huge problem, just needed to reassure him that Nick and I were just friends, and we'd be on our way.  But that's not exactly what happened.
Alex goes on to say that nothing will make him not feel uncomfortable with the situation.  I said I still didn’t understand, but I was willing to do anything to make it better, and how I wish he trusted me a little bit more after I had already explained to him twice that Nick and I were strictly friends on completely mutual terms.  Alex then drilled me on what Nick and I did together when we first met, sexual stuff was specified because I knew that's what he meant.  He then told me that he was ""not going to deal with that."" He said he wasn't going to give me an ultimatum, but instead just leave.  

I'm now just staring at my phone trying to process what the hell just happened within like a 10 minute period.  I thought I had complete control of the situation. But instead, it came crashing down around me.  I'm now freaking out a little on the inside.  Not knowing what to say, I ask him what he meant by ""leave"" and he responded with ""Whatever we have is now over."" He then restates his reason being that I still talk and hang out with a guy I hooked up with.  I, being the mature person I am, tried to call him, which resulted in me being sent to voice mail early, twice.   I then sent a rather long and apologetic text finishing with a goodbye and that I'd miss him.  I thought that would be it, but I then got a very nasty and hurt-filled text about how ""Nick will be there for me... [and how] everything will be just perfect for me with him"".  I'm now an emotional wreck because I have no clue why this is happening.  It was just so out of the blue that I couldn't comprehend it.  I knew that responding back hurtfully wouldn't help the situation, but I didn't want to just leave it at that.  I responded back asking why this was a problem all of a sudden and explained, once again, how Nick and I are just friends and we hadn't done anything in months.  Alex asked me if there were things I talked about with Nick that I wouldn’t tell him, which I denied and went on to say I would never keep anything from him and that I'd tell him anything.  At this point I was just trying to hold together the remaining scraps of our relationship because I thought for some reason I could somehow make it better.  He then stated “If you can talk about the same things with me, why do you even have to be friends with him?”  I’m appalled that he would even ask that.  It would be like if one of my friends told me why I had any other friends other than them because that’s all I would need. I explain, for a final time, that Nick and I were just friends and we had met through mutual friends, back when I had first moved to uni and was looking for some new friends, seeing as most of mine had moved away to their respected universities.  I ask him if there was anything I could do to make this better, granted I knew everything was already over.  He responded very hurtfully by saying, “I think that you should start talking to Nick more.  He can see you pretty often now, which would be good for you.  You two seem to have actual conversations, so that’s a plus.  Eventually that might lead to something else.”

I'm awe struck.  I couldn’t understand how someone I thought liked me so much would just change their attitude so drastically and to then hurt me when I’m already down.  I picked up whatever was left of my dignity and pride, restated all the great things we did over the course of our short, but amazing, two weeks, and how much I liked him and how I wish I got to know him better to “have actual conversations”.  I gave a couple of minutes, and to no sign of a response from him, I said, “Goodbye, Alex.”  It was plain and simple.  I sat back for a while trying to take it all in and I surprisingly didn’t cry…too much.

Now, on to the actual question.  Do you guys think his reasoning for the break-up was justified?  If so, why? Thanks.

tl;dr – Boyfriend of two weeks dumps me solely because I still talk and hang out with a guy I hooked up with, but are now strictly friends with.  Was his reasoning for the break-up justified?

I'm a 25 year old gay guy, and for the  past 3 and a half years I've been in a relationship with my dream guy. He is a bit older (33) but that hasn't ever been an issue and if anything in our relationship I'm the old and boring one LOL. We are having a sexual issue, well I mean for me it isn't necessarily an issue but for him it is. 
I have had sex with a couple of people before him and I'm pretty experienced and so is he. The thing is: I have never really enjoyed sex at all and while it isn't particularly painful or UNenjoyable I just don't get anything from it either way and IMO a back massage feels better. I don't want you to misunderstand me, my sexual parts DO work and I do get horny and furthermore I find my man very attractive. But the whole act of sex (both top and bottom and oral and rimming and a hand job  and any other sex act) does absolutely nothing for me. I have always just had sex because it was just ""what you did"" with someone that you like/love/are attracted too. I'm turned on mainly by making the person I care about feel good and also the romance and emotion of it (ex. I don't wank to porn but I will get off solo to a make out scene). I don't mind having sex with him if it makes him happy but I have never been able to come from anything but my own hand, ever. This isn't an issue for me at all because I will have sex with if that is what he wants and I will even feign pleasure from it (""ooh aah"" and such) and then I will just jerk off when he goes to sleep or in the shower or something. But it's not like he is just a random one-nighter, we live together and he works for a company based abroad from home an I own a business that is less than a 10 minute drive from home so I am around the house to eat and just randomly throughout the day so he knows me very well and he can tell I am not enjoying myself. At first he was embarrassed because he thought that he was a bad lover and I had to fake to make him feel better, I explained to him that I really just don't like sex but I do love him and want him happy so it is my pleasure to have sex with him when he wants: needs it and I have also initiated it many times just to make him feel as sexy as I think he is. He said that me being able to only get myself off isn't normal and he wants us to see a sec therapist and work in it and he is determined to ""get me off"" even though I've explained to him that since I lost my virginity almost 10 years ago (and have had a lot of sex, been to orgies etc because I thought I would acquire a taste for it lol) the only person who has ever made me come is my right hand. Last night we had sex because I could tell he wanted too and I went out of my way to make him feel wanted and hot but even after he finished he kept trying to ""get me off"" and it became very irritating for me and I actually had to pretend I was having an orgasm and wipe off real quick so I could go to bed without bruising his ego. However, he told me in the morning that he knew I was faking it last night and if I really can't enjoy sex with him he wants us to get help and wont sleep with me because he said  that he  doesn't want me to do anything I don't wanna do (but I do wanna sleep with him because he enjoys it. And I enjoy making him happy!) For me it's like when he tried to bake me a cake for my birthday but he isn't a very good baker and it didn't tastve good, but I thought that it was no sweet that he did it that I acted like it was the best because it made him happy that I enjoyed it. I don't mind sex at all and it isn't painful or horrible I just don't get anything from it all, but as long as I'm satisfied with arrangement and take care if myself later and he is getting both laid and loved idk what's the big deal? 
Some kind and practical advice would be greatly appreciated! Thanks so much

So I was a freshman in college, just starting to realize that maybe I like guys, maybe I don't have to fall in love with a girl, and maybe my idea of a perfect little American family may have a man by my side and not a women.
I went to Panama City Beach that spring break with some of my fraternity brothers and (having just discovered Grindr) decided to see who would be on Grindr in the area. I met a guy on there and after chatting for quite a bit I find out he's also in college and he's from Oklahoma, just like me. 
We ended up hanging out on the beach after all my friends were passed out and we'd talk on the beach and we made out a bit and it was incredible. I thought to myself that I had met a guy who I had a crush on and I'll I could think about was wanting more.
So after spring break we continued talking for about three months. He told me that he wanted to see me so badly that he was going to make a trip up to Joplin (where I go to school) to see me. 
At this point in my life I was going through some incredibly difficult times, one of which was I was in extreme denial about my sexuality. After he told me he was going to come up to Joplin, I freaked out. Bad. 
I ended up telling him that there's no way I could be gay and that it just doesn't feel right and that I couldn't talk to him anymore. Later that night I bawled my eyes out like a baby.
Fast forward three years into the future. I feel like I'm accepting myself more and I even go so far as to come out to my family and friends. At this point in my life I'm becoming very confident in myself, I've made my way out of the bad times and I'm fostering in this new era of being true to myself.
That's when I get the text from him saying that he's going on a road trip with his friend and he'll be coming through Joplin. 
I hadn't heard from him in three years and for some reason he texts me. I start thinking, maybe this is my second chance? Maybe he is willing to forgive me and perhaps we can kinda pick up where I ended things. 
So I message him and tell him that I'll come to his college town and we can all spend the weekend together and I can meet his friends and we'll have a great time. I also find out that around the time he texted me was the same time that he had just ended a relationship he had with a guy, so I'm thinking ""Okay, he's newly single. He texts me out of the blue. This is my second chance.""
I make my way to his town, which that weekend happened to be homecoming, and we had big plans to go out to the bars and watch the football game and it was going to be great. I kept telling myself, finally I can get a chance to redeem myself. 
The first night I was there we went out to the bars and he meets up with a guy he's talking to and brings him back to his house and the guy stays the night with him.
At this point I'm crushed. I let myself believe that I had had a second chance at something that I truly wanted and instead he's obviously not interested. So, being a bit drunk from the bars, I cry myself to sleep that night. 
The second day we go out to the game and once again head to the bars that night. At this point, his friends are telling me, ""I don't know why he's with that guy, you guys should be together."" and other things like that. So I think well okay whatever, honestly it's my fault we ended things anyway, I have no right to feel bad now and he can do whatever he wants with his life.
While we're waiting to get into the bars, he's telling me things like ""Oh I make stupid decision when I'm drunk."" and essentially hinting that this guy is not exactly his type. 
So we start another night of drinking and lo and behold, this guy spend the night again with the him.
So basically I go to bed and wait until morning so I can leave.
On the somewhat long drive back home, I cry probably half the trip, torn between being upset at the situation, mad at myself, or acceptance that we can never have anything together. I bounce between all of these emotions till it drives me insane. 
So a couple days after I return from this trip to his college town. I decide that I need to just text him and ask him if he would ever be interested in a relationship and if not, well at least I can be friends with him. 
After typing all of it out, I think to myself that I could be okay with just being friends. 
He lets me know that he's no where near ready for a relationship and that he just really thinks of me as a friend at this point. 
So once again I get upset at myself.
So fast forward to today. Since I asked him if he'd ever think we could have a relationship again, I haven't texted him. I get a text from him today asking what I would think about going to Austin, TX for New Years Eve. So now I don't know what to do.

If you've made it this far through that wall of text, it means quite a bit to me. I'm at a complete lost of what to do.
This is the first person in my life that I have had a romantic interest in that has had the power to make me cry. I tend to not show to much of my feelings to other people.
I keep thinking to myself that the chance of anything coming out of me going to Austin, TX with him and his friends are slim except for more anguish on my part. But god that slim sliver of hope makes me want to go so terribly badly. At this point in my life, he's everything I could possibly want in a guy, and if we ended up talking again and made something out of it, I would never do anything to hurt him again. But, while I want a second stab at a relationship with him, I feel like I have no right to expect a second one. 
I don't know what to do. Should I go to Austin with him and his friends? Should I just forget about him? Should I make attempts at just being friends, and if so how do I move past this emotional road block I've created. 
At this point, I'm emotionally distraught and any advice will be welcomed.

So long story short, I met a guy from out of state. We both have pretty strong feelings for one another. We wanted to try and build something long distance.

It's been about a month and he suddenly got quiet. I made sure I wasn't being annoying and texting/snapping too much. He said it wasn't me and he ""just gets real quiet sometimes, as weird as it sounds."" However, he apparently has time to chat up with guys on Grindr. We said we weren't going to tie each other down right now, as it wasn't fair to either of us, as long as we were honest. The only reason I know he was on there was cause the little green bubble that pops up on their profile when they are online. 
*I saved his messages, that's why I can still see it although hes like 1000+ miles away.* 

Anyways in the same conversation about his quietness, he also said he would never do anything to hurt me.

I don't know what I should do. Its been since 10am est yesterday since any form of conversation has been made. He talks like he cares, and in fact says he cares, but he isn't acting like it.

So Tom decided to tell his whole family that Jerry had raped him and that started a whole line of crap. Tom kept sending him threatening texts on his life, on telling him that he should die. Threatening to get a bunch of people to come and hurt him. It got to the point where Jerry had to call the police and ended up getting escorted to the police station to file a report.

Come a week later, Jerry is still getting these harassing text messages and even worse, his sexual assaulter from a few years ago is now messaging him because of Tom; apparently sending photos of that traumatic event to him. He hasn't reported that yet because he doesn't think he's strong enough to relive that event again...Now, assaulter and Tom are both threatening to do things to him.

It sounds like a crazy story, but it's completely true. What should he do now? There hasn't been any real action from the police as far as I know. Any advice is welcome.

TL;DR: Friend is being threatened by guy that was kicked out and sexual assaulter. Police were notified, but it's considered a ""non-emergency"" because they are only threats.
**Update: He changed all his locks and applied for a protection order. He also has been in contact with the officer on his case and was told it has been sent to the crown counsel. And yes, Jerry is gay**

He is a self employed attorney and I have quit work to go back to school full time, so we are completely dependent on his income. For at least a year he's been overly obsessed with figuring out physics, but it's only getting worst. He's a very smart guy and graduated from Columbia Law in the top of his class, but his background is in International Relations and Strategic Studies - not math or science.

Basically we've come to a point where he will spend around 40 hours a week on physics (if not more). He think's he has figured out how to unify the 4 forces and how everything works, but I doubt it. Right now rent isn't paid and if it isn't paid in less than three days the eviction process begins. We're basically living off credit cards. I'm worried I'm going to have to abandon my education and this relationship to avoid being broke and homeless.

I'm not sure what I can do to get him on track. His Plan B is to sell his retirement stocks to make ends meet in the mean time until ""[He is] published, has changed the world, and we are rich and famous.""
What do I do? How can I get him to focus on making sure we have money for rent and food? Do I give up on finishing my degree? Do I move back to my parents in another state?

I feel trapped in a very uncomfortable position.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;A little back ground: My partner and I have been together for 3 years. He is a self employed attorney and I have quit work to go back to school full time, so we are completely dependent on his income. For at least a year he&amp;#39;s been overly obsessed with figuring out physics, but it&amp;#39;s only getting worst. He&amp;#39;s a very smart guy and graduated from Columbia Law in the top of his class, but his background is in International Relations and Strategic Studies - not math or science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically we&amp;#39;ve come to a point where he will spend around 40 hours a week on physics (if not more). He think&amp;#39;s he has figured out how to unify the 4 forces and how everything works, but I doubt it. Right now rent isn&amp;#39;t paid and if it isn&amp;#39;t paid in less than three days the eviction process begins. We&amp;#39;re basically living off credit cards. I&amp;#39;m worried I&amp;#39;m going to have to abandon my education and this relationship to avoid being broke and homeless.&lt;/p&gt;

Disclaimer: I'm a 22y south-american who's going to spend 4y in Europe doing Msc/PhD. I've been told several times, especially by europeans, that, as a general rule, they consider latin people to be very attractive.
I consider myself kind-of attractive (I guess? I've been told so): 6.2ft, 180lb, dark hair/eyes, slim body. I've had some europeans friends tell me that ""I'd be a success"" at the clubs there, and since I haven't been with a guy in a while (I can't even remembe the last time, more than a year I think), I'm looking forward to enjoy this situation and then settle down.

I've got a big crush on blondes and redheads, especially with clear eyes (green/blue). I was thinking about either going to Germany or somewhere in Scandinavia, Sweeden or Norway. Can someone provide me advice/suggestions? Thanks!
