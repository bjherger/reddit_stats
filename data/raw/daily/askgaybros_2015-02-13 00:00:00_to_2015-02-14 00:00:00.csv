I hate a lot of things about being gay and if I had a choice, I'd be straight. Not only that, but I also frequently use my sexuality as the root of all problems (for ex. why do I do poorly in school -&gt; I'm depressed -&gt; because I'm gay). And yes, it makes me behave like a victim and I hate that. 

But also, let's be honest now, the gay community on average is vapid and I hate that, aside from the promiscuity (which I would totally be into if I liked how I look naked), the awkwardly hyper-masculine culture (ex. this entire subreddit that I love) and the GL/fit only culture (that I'm also part of), as a middle Eastern gay man, I feel like I'm not even supposed to be gay. I honestly can't handle losing my entire family and I hate that I can't have a normal life where I can go hang out at my brother's place during holidays with my wife, 2.5 kids and my white picket fence. I envy guys who can even deliberate coming out to their entire family. And it's for what?! A life of sleeping around with guys who *also* hate themselves and crush on straight guys?! HOW IS THAT EVEN FAIR?! It really makes me feel like the future is bleak and it hurts to accept that. *I don't even want any of this.* I don't want to be on this subreddit feeling like I'm going to cry and feeling completely helpless.

I've now moved out and I'm distancing myself from my family, but it's not any easier. If anything, I now introduce myself as straight/make up ex-girlfriend stories or I introduce myself as bi, which I think is true but I know I'd rather end up with a man. This is largely to people I don't want to know though, so it's okay.

For a while now, I was going to post about how I can't come to terms with little things, but now I realize that it's all of it. It's everything. I STRONGLY hate being gay. I would have done gay reparative therapy if I didn't think it was bullshit. The gay men, with the exception of one guy, that I've met in the past have made me hate being gay even more- solely based on their personalities. I feel extremely alienated from regular gay culture and gay people in large groups make me very anxious. The only interaction I have with gay people is online and it's probably because I perceive them the way I want to.

How the hell do I come to terms with being gay? How the hell do I accept everything there is to being gay? Why does it all suck? Why do I frequently introduce myself as straight? Why is gay such a dirty word- my phone even refuses to autocomplete it.

**TL;DR** I've known I like men for a few years now, but I'm still moderately in the closet/ I hate everything about being gay. How do I become more comfortable with it?

I'm an 18 year old cisgendered homosexual Asian male and sometimes I find it hard to reconcile being with white men when in the back of my mind I'm constantly reminded of the social inequalities between us due to race. I'm super attuned to the privileges they have over me and countless others on the basis on race. I read an article by Kristen Maye in the past and have re-read it a few times and I resonate with her on some level (link at the end).

These feelings just kind of really suck because I'm primarily attracted to white men, which I reason is due to social conditioning, yet my personal politics and conscience tell me there's something not quite right with ""consorting"" with ""the enemy"" if you will.

""Why I Don't Date White Men"" = http://feminspire.com/why-i-dont-date-white-men/

A few things pulled from the article:

----""In my mind, that means that the hypothetical relationship I imagine between myself and a white man wouldn’t go very far. I would be compelled to hold this man accountable to recognizing his white male privilege, while he would likely resist the discomfort of learning that his actions and words reinforce pernicious systems of oppression which oppress masses of people everywhere.""

----""Personally, I have also had trouble imagining intimate relationships with white men. This is because the history of oppression, exploitation, and dehumanization of Black women’s bodies by white men is searingly painful and enraging for me. Too often, vestiges of that uneven historical relationship are present in my mind and invariably color my observations of contemporary black woman/white man interactions. I don’t necessarily feel that Black women in these situations are disempowered to the extent that say, an enslaved woman was, but I do imagine that their white partner’s unconsciously conditioned expectations of privilege compromises their own free exercise of will on some level in their relationship. And that’s not fair. Beyond simply not being fair, curbing someone’s exercise of human agency, whether intentional or not, is in my book is a small form of violence.""

Sorry if my post isn't really that well thought out. It's 4am here. I have trouble putting how I feel about this whole thing even in my own mind. If there are any questions or clarifications I can answer/make please just ask.

Edit: I understand there may be backlash from the predominately white population here that may misconstrue what I'm trying to say here, so I'll try to maybe explain a bit more. I'm not arguing per-se that white men are evil, colonizing, villains blah blah, but rather acknowledging that the ramifications of things like slavery and colonialism have vested white people, and men in general (patriarchy!), institutional power over people of color and their own privilege. I'm not calling you out on how things are today, I'm just acknowledging that things just are and want to deal with the present. I'm particularly interested in the thoughts of other PoC and their thoughts on this. Do you notice these disparities? If you do, do you care or ever think about it? etc. etc.

And again, I know I'm not being as eloquent as possible here (English major too :P), but it's 6am by this point and honestly I think I lack the vocabulary and foresight to really explain what I'm trying to explain. Mah bad if I come off as overly contentious.

UPDATE: Haha, I'm really shocked by how much attention this thread is getting. I think the mixed responses I'm getting are a good indicator about the state of race relations is still a very contentious topic even today in what a society some people would like to think is post-racism.

So I'm not out yet and have never been in a relationship before. Last week I went out once with this guy through online, and I really like him. There was definitely chemistry. But when I asked him out again he hesitated, saying ""he'd been burned before as a first-boyfriend,"" and that although he ""really liked the first date and likes me so far,"" he still doesn't think it's a good idea (he said ""The answer is not 'no,' but 'not now'"", which makes no sense to me). What does he mean?

I rarely click with anyone online so quickly. He's handsome and smart, we share common interests, and we complements each other in many ways. Basically everything I was looking for.

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;m not out yet and have never been in a relationship before. Last week I went out once with this guy through online, and I really like him. There was definitely chemistry. But when I asked him out again he hesitated, saying &amp;quot;he&amp;#39;d been burned before as a first-boyfriend,&amp;quot; and that although he &amp;quot;really liked the first date and likes me so far,&amp;quot; he still doesn&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s a good idea (he said &amp;quot;The answer is not &amp;#39;no,&amp;#39; but &amp;#39;not now&amp;#39;&amp;quot;, which makes no sense to me). What does he mean?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rarely click with anyone online so quickly. He&amp;#39;s handsome and smart, we share common interests, and we complements each other in many ways. Basically everything I was looking for. I&amp;#39;ve been hurt before and I&amp;#39;ve had difficulties falling for someone. Last thing I want is to make my first date a failed attempt. What do I do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He agreed to talk to me face to face on Sunday. What should I say? Is there any way to convey my opinion without pushing it?&lt;/p&gt;

Growing up I started to watch porn at around the ages of 11/12. I started out with girl &amp; guy porn and I loved it. But as I grew older (more specifically from the ages of 14-18) I started to watch gay porn. And I loved it just as much as I loved the straight porn. I loved it so much that I stopped watching the straight porn almost entirely. Now that I'm almost 19, I feel conflicted about what I like. I was into girls at the start of puberty but that stretched to liking guys to liking guys more than girls. As of now I still think guys are hot but the thought of having a relationship with a girl is so much better (imo) than having a relationship with a guy. Just thinking about it makes me heart beat a little faster.

I'm not really sure what I'm trying to ask, but I feel so conflicted inside. Does this mean I'm bi? Gay? Bi-curious?

Hey folks! I have a personal anecdote to share with you, but it does raise some larger questions that I don't think are specific to my situation. I posed this question to AskMen but no one responded. 

A friend of mine I went to grad school with got a job at the same place I did and we've been hanging out a lot more since then. He's a great guy and I've really enjoyed getting to know him better, but lately something has been making me really uncomfortable. 

I'm an out gay male, and part of the reason I value this friend so much is because I've been uncomfortable around men for most of my life. You know, besides the one's I've been bangin'. I'm proud of who I am, but I do try to be conscious of straight mens' comfort levels. For example, I am freakishly cautious when sharing a table with a straight guy friend. If I accidentally touch their leg with my knee I will scrunch up like a rolly-polly to make sure I'm not invading their space. I'm a tall guy, so this happens constantly and it takes a long time building up a friendship for me to become physically comfortable with my straight male friends. Not a problem with the gays, or with women. 

My friend, we'll call him Bob, get's a little comfortable when we go out drinking. He rests his hand on my knee when he talks to me, he leans fully against when we are walking or chatting at a bar, and he's grabbed my ass a couple of times. Recently when we were at a pool hall he spent a good chunk of the night guiding me away from other players by the small of my back, even after I'd already started to move. All of this stuff has happened in plain view of our mutual friends. There's nothing sneaky or weird about it. The butt squeeze just seems to be him joking around. He doesn't seem to show the same comfort level with our other friends, but I know he has a bunch of college pals from a team he was on and from what I understand they're all pretty comfortable with each other.

Lots of gay guys would read these as come-on's, but I'm fairly confident that's not the case - and that isn't what I'm asking about. I'm not romantically confused here, but I do feel a little disturbed. A lot of this touching has made me really uncomfortable, but that discomfort is making me reflect on platonic touch between men. 

I have very mixed feelings. On the one hand, it makes me intensely uncomfortable, even though he is the one initiating. On the other hand, I take it as a huge compliment and a token of Bob's comfort with me as a friend. Is my unease just a bunch of internalized homophobia? Shouldn't men be free to casually touch each other without it being immediately labelled as sexually motivated? [Aren't we living in an era of platonic guy love?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lL4L4Uv5rf0) 

So these are the questions I'm posing to you: Where do you draw the line when it comes to platonic touch between buds? Should I just get comfortable with this? How physically comfortable are you with your straight guy friends? And if you'd like to weigh in on my specific situation, I wouldn't mind that either. 

TL;DR : Good buddy gets a little too familiar after a couple of drinks. Wondering if my discomfort is totally normal, or I should get over it. What do you guys think is normal bro-touch? 


Edit: I've asked several of my female friends about this and almost universally they have said, ""Regardless of why it makes you uncomfortable or who you are uncomfortable with, if it makes you uncomfortable you should ask him to stop."" But I feel like that has a lot to do with the female perspective. I also feel like it's a form of male acceptance I often feel I lack.

True enough, but that was true before HIV, is true for majority of straight people who don't always use condoms, etc. And there are STIs even if you wear condoms. 

I'm on PrEP but still wear a condom. For me, it's about back-up. I've had condoms break several times. I'm also more relaxed during oral sex now. It's great.
