I want to hear your definition of gaybros and how you came to realise that you were a gaybro. 

To me a gaybro is a gay (or bi) guy who's interests don't have the word 'gay' in them. I make an exception for gay sports teams. For whatever reason, I know gays who don't have any hobbies and I find that very strange. I know no straight guys who have no hobbies but I know plenty of gays, some in their late twenties, who just don't do anything at all outside of work than go to bars.

I think I'm a gaybro because I play Rugby (if a little fair weather), I play in a band, I do DIY, I am a veritable curator of horror movies and I brew beer. 

I think a good definition of a gaybro is one who, if your friends were to describe you, they might not say gay first, or second, or even third. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey bros. &lt;/p&gt;

Unfortunately I had fallen in love with him and I tried really hard not to show it as I was worried that it would mess up how close we were, but he still caught me gazing at him sometimes which I honestly had no idea I was doing.

He did it on chat because we were on skype with three other friends at the same time who do not know I am questioning. 

I am pretty secure with myself and have high self esteem so I will have no trouble getting over him, I'm just worried that he's gonna be really distant now.

What I would like to know is:

Did I handle that well?

Is he overreacting?

What can I do to make it better?

I know I've screwed up big time but I don't really regret any of it. I don't have anybody to talk to/tell this to so I'm just going to post it here. 

So recently I've been exploring my sexuality. And in the past month I've been with a few guys. Mostly through Grindr. Each encounter has been fun and none of them were creeps. We mostly just kissed and had oral, sometimes I let them rim me because well, it felt good. All these men were older than me. I'm 18. Some of them were in their 50s. I was quite specific and asked if they were safe etc and took my time before ""meeting"". Never did I let them anal me or I anal them. 

But now I've had enough. I've had my little exploration and I think I'm probably bi. I know that now. And I don't really have any regrets about my situation. I just wanted to tell somebody and I didn't know who to tell so bingo, reddit!

I do have some questions. Should I get tested for STDs/HIV? I never properly tasted their cum and never did any anal penetration so I don't think this is necessary? Am I correct in thinking this? And also secondly, what I happen to bump into any of them in real life? Obviously my family and friends have no idea about all this and I don't want them to. (Personally I can barely remember some of them and the most I told them about myself was my name/what I do).

Should I feel guilty or bad? I don't know if I should...but I currently don't personally feel any regret in this. In fact I thought it was quite a good experience for myself and now I've grown as a human being. Some people might find that me being with older men disgusting but they were all very friendly people. It was all just a result of me being horny and wanting to try stuff I guess. Ah, teenage hormones.

Please help me here, I think/know this is an utterly unsafe practice. However I cannot easily find a credible resource that states the risk of this particular practice explicitly. Most state the higher HIV risk in homosexual male sex broadly.

To clarify: he believes it is only if you are analy penetrated by an HIV+ man, that you are at risk. Whereas he himself as HIV-, is at no risk penetrating whomever anally. This is notwithstanding that South Africa has amongst the highest AIDS rates!

Any links explicitly addressing all the differing manners, in specific detail, that HIV can be transmitted in male homosexual sex is most appreciated. I am very thankful for this forum as a goto resource.

I guess I just want someone to talk to, even if it sounds crazy. I won't be able to get tested until Monday or Tuesday, so I'll be worried the whole time until then. 

I’m 20. The last time I got tested was late or mid November, I believe. I was negative. Since then I have been with three guys, one of which I had already been with before I got tested. I guess the most important thing here is that I have never had anal sex still. But anyways. Like I said, I've been with three guys since then. 

One we made out and gave oral, the next we kissed there times lightly, he gave me a blow job for a few seconds and we thrusted naked against each other but there was no anal contact, I don't think. Definitely no penetration on either of us. I guess that part worries me. We also jerked off for a few minutes. And he kind of fingered me. Finally, with the last guy, we just made out, cuddled, and jerked off briefly. I didn't mean for it to be weird describing all that, but I guess those are important details. 

The first one I'm nearly 100% is negative, the second one was negative as of late November and said he wasn't with anyone but me, and the last one is 100% negative. Now, Last Tuesday, 3 &amp; 1/2 weeks after the second guy and like 2 weeks after the 3rd, I woke up a little sick. I felt weak, my head hurt a bit and my joints were a little sore. And in class I felt slightly nauseous, but the nauseous part went away pretty quickly. This may be due to the fact that I went to bed at 3:30 the previous Saturday and Sunday, and I don't handle late night well. So I went to bed at 10:30 that night and woke up with almost zero headache and my body was in much less pain. However that morning I had a very sore throat and I guess I still didn't feel perfect. I also got night sweats one night during Wednesday. Now Friday has just passed, and everything is gone but an extremely mild sore throat and soreness at the bottom of my mouth near the back of my tongue. I'm still freaked out. I mean, anal alone has a 1.4% chance of infection and oral or kissing is close to zero, so I don't know if I should be worried. 

I guess the real point of this is two things. One, if it could be a common sickness, which I think it probably is? And two, to see if anyone else had a similar experience and it turned out fine! I just need some comfort, I guess.

I used to cam every single day when I had no friends and felt lonely often. I stopped camming after I told myself that it wasn't healthy and it was making me feel worse. Once I did therapy for depression (I am diagnosed with major depressive disorder and OCD), felt better and got more social, I stopped doing it for months... but then I started again once I felt lonely. Usually I come to realize that I have no friends and no one cares about me, so I fall back into the cycle. It wasn't as often.. Maybe once every few weeks. I think what made it so destructive is that I would cam with people that I didn't want to cam with. It was more like self-harm than pleasure. My main problems are depression, fear of rejection and loneliness. Loneliness triggers my depression and that makes my fear of rejection worse. There were moments in my life where I did feel like I had control over myself and those were the times when I did not engage in any destructive behaviour. I had people in my life to talk to and feel close to, but once they left or once I thought they were not interested and I was a burden to them, I fell back into loneliness and depression... Then I relapse into camming. You see, my depression sometimes comes with major horniness, uncomfortable anxiety and very strong urges and obsessions. I could cam for 8 hours straight and finish 10 times and still feel aggressively horny. Sometimes I get so horny I feel more confident and hit on guys in person which I NEVER do. But I regret it later and fall into even more depression, anger, lethargy and disgust with myself. Other times I don't feel horny when I am depressed, just no energy. It feels so wrong knowing that I did things on cam that I didn't want to.. Like I violated myself. Any advice? I know that I should be talking about this in therapy, but I just want to hear what others think. I really want to live a healthy and stable life with normal relationships :(","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t cam as much as I used to. I used to cam every single day when I had no friends and felt lonely often. I stopped camming after I told myself that it wasn&amp;#39;t healthy and it was making me feel worse. Once I did therapy for depression (I am diagnosed with major depressive disorder and OCD), felt better and got more social, I stopped doing it for months... but then I started again once I felt lonely. Usually I come to realize that I have no friends and no one cares about me, so I fall back into the cycle. It wasn&amp;#39;t as often.. Maybe once every few weeks. I think what made it so destructive is that I would cam with people that I didn&amp;#39;t want to cam with. It was more like self-harm than pleasure. My main problems are depression, fear of rejection and loneliness. Loneliness triggers my depression and that makes my fear of rejection worse. There were moments in my life where I did feel like I had control over myself and those were the times when I did not engage in any destructive behaviour.

Well i followed through with some advice, or am at least trying. 

I went to see a psychologist Monday. It went well. She pointed out things that i Already knew were an issue like needing to cut my parents off financially and emotionally or rather take a step back and say  ""hey i can't deal with your shit anymore"". Which I've started doing alot of. 

She advised i need to get my own place. I know this is a big one. I need to be away from my parents and closer to my man to try and rebuild or relationship back to a good place. I've put steps in place to achieve this sooner than later. Hoping 2wks max and I'll be on my own place and we will have our own private place to spend as much time together as we want. 

She pointed out that I'm a strong person not weak. I've gone through a shitload and taken on a whole lot of responsibility and stress so young. She said i should feel proud. That i should start viewing my ability to get this far alone, as a sign that i can take anything thrown at me. And that i need to stop viewing myself as the bottom priority and view me as number 1. Which again in trying to. 

We talked about my relationship and said that i need to stop projecting my insecurities and fears onto it and instead confront them within myself. This scares me but I'm trying. 

However that was Monday. Come Tuesday, I'd had a hugely stressful day, copped abuse left and right from family and clients. I was angry and hurting and yeah. Me and my bd had a huge argument. I just lost it. We'd organised to meet for lunch on Thursday which was  fine, but I'd slso organised to see him saturday night this weekend the weekend before to make up for not being able to be together last weekend. He said no he can't do it, that we never discussed that etcetc. I kind of flew off the handle. Basically losing it at him because we never spend time together (weve been together since 5 dec 13 and have only seen each other 20ish times in person) and it looks like, from my perspective, that he's just making excuses everyone we have to cancel. But he's not, it's me interpreting it that way. So any way we get into a big argument. 

Come Wednesday he's unsure if he wants to be together. He loves me more than anything i know this and he makes sure i do, but he doesn't want to fight anymore, and doesn't know if he wants to stay together. I'm invisible crushed. I've tried talking to him to convince him I'm trying to get better. And the reason i want to is him. I want to spend the rest of my life with him... 
So he agreed to see me tomorrow night. He wants to stay together but he just doesn't know. But he thinks he will know tomorrow night. I'm freaking out, i don't want to lose him. He's my everything, my rock. He's my Pup. I just don't know what to do. I keep crying out of the blue. I try to hold onto hope that he will find that he loves me too much to go and to work on our relationship. I need him. I'm not ready to let him walk away. 

I guess this is more a vent thread than anything. Just don't know who to talk to or what to say or do to prove to him i want to change and I'm trying to change :(

TL;DR – A few years ago, I was diagnosed with early signs of degenerative disc disease at the age of 22 (I'm 1.75 years away from being 30 now).  Over time the cushioning of one of my discs herniated and started putting pressure on a nerve in my back; which then caused nerve damage in one of my legs.

The muscles in the leg are noticeably atrophied compared my other one, and I'm currently walking with a limp because of the damage.  I'm going in for an epidural steroid injection into my spine to treat it next week, however my doctor has made it clear that my leg may never completely recover.  Nevertheless, I will be starting physical therapy after the procedure.  ... Fuck, I'm writing another novel.

K.  So, basically, I limp everywhere I walk, my legs are uneven in muscle mass, and I'm incredibly out of shape because of it.

My own personal sexualization happened through friends, so honestly, the more I get to know someone, the more I want to have sex with them.

My theory, while not scientific, comes from how you are sexualized in adolescents.  Most people who have sex with their friends during their teens and while confirming their sexual orientation and desires, probably find having sex with friends a good thing.

So everyone I've told this story said that Jake might be gay. I don't think he is because he hasn't shown signs of being one. Also, he's had 2 girlfriends. Both of which he had sexual activities with. What do you guys think? 

Me and my best friend fought. We'll call him Jake. Being best friends, Jake and I are extremely and almost unreasonably attached to each other. Every time we see each other, we would always hug or cuddle. But no, neither of us are gay. We're just really touchy I guess. 

So about a week ago, I was with my other friend, we'll call him Josh. I'm also really close friends with Josh. Jake doesn't like Josh very much though. Which is kind of weird because they used to be best friends when they were young. I'm in the same class with Josh while Jake belonged to a different class. 

I was working on some homework for Physics with Josh. So we were in the Physics lab. And for some reason, Jake went there too. Probably because he needed to do some homework as well. 

He sees me with Josh and immediately goes to me and hugs me tight. He made me go with him and told Josh ""Fuck off. He's mine."" 

I realize that's a really rude thing to say. But I think he said it because he's being protective of me. Josh is gay and in the closet. And he has confessed to me that he had feelings for me. I turned him down and offered to just be friends. And he was okay with it. 

I spent a couple of minutes hugging Jake and talking to him while Josh just sat there looking at us sadly. I told Jake that I had to go and do the homework with Josh. And he said ""Oh. You'd rather be with him? Okay."" And rushed out of the Physics lab. 

I didn't think of it much at first. But then he didn't reply to any of my texts. And when I tried to hug him, he didn't hug back. And he refuses to talk to me and just calls me ""Baka."" Which means idiot in Japanese. 

So I kind of got hurt. We haven't been talking for more than a week now. It's driving me crazy sad. And every time I see him at school, I have to pretend that nothing is wrong even though everything is. I've actually cried about it a lot. It sucks when the person you care about the most won't even talk to you. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys.

&lt;p&gt;So about a week ago, I was with my other friend, we&amp;#39;ll call him Josh. I&amp;#39;m also really close friends with Josh. Jake doesn&amp;#39;t like Josh very much though. Which is kind of weird because they used to be best friends when they were young. I&amp;#39;m in the same class with Josh while Jake belonged to a different class. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was working on some homework for Physics with Josh. So we were in the Physics lab. And for some reason, Jake went there too. Probably because he needed to do some homework as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He sees me with Josh and immediately goes to me and hugs me tight. He made me go with him and told Josh &amp;quot;Fuck off. He&amp;#39;s mine.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realize that&amp;#39;s a really rude thing to say. But I think he said it because he&amp;#39;s being protective of me. Josh is gay and in the closet. And he has confessed to me that he had feelings for me. I turned him down and offered to just be friends. And he was okay with it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent a couple of minutes hugging Jake and talking to him while Josh just sat there looking at us sadly. I told Jake that I had to go and do the homework with Josh. And he said &amp;quot;Oh. You&amp;#39;d rather be with him? Okay.&amp;quot; And rushed out of the Physics lab. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t think of it much at first. But then he didn&amp;#39;t reply to any of my texts. And when I tried to hug him, he didn&amp;#39;t hug back. And he refuses to talk to me and just calls me &amp;quot;Baka.&amp;quot; Which means idiot in Japanese. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I kind of got hurt. We haven&amp;#39;t been talking for more than a week now. It&amp;#39;s driving me crazy sad. And every time I see him at school, I have to pretend that nothing is wrong even though everything is. I&amp;#39;ve actually cried about it a lot. It sucks when the person you care about the most won&amp;#39;t even talk to you. &lt;/p&gt;

I travel a lot for work, and recently I traveled to one of our offices, as usual I opened scruff to check out the meat market and saw there was a co-worker in there. I didn't talk to him, but in scruff you can see who saw your profile so he knows I saw him and he knows I know he's gay (he isn't out to the office).

I wasn't looking to hookup or anything, and I didnt even say hello to him over there, during our work day we did have to interact (albeit with other people around us) and we kept it professional like nothing happened. 

Why would he block me? Would he be scared that I might out him? (i wouldn't) I would personally block someone who's very annoying/insisting and I'm not interested, but never someone who never even said hello. 

What should I do? Should I one day tell him ""Look, you didn't have to block me, I'm not interested in outing anyone if that was your concern"" ?

 I've known for awhile that i'm different and this always bothered me when i was maybe 15 yo i started noticing the signs and i hated myself for that. 
 I have been suppressing  my feelings since then.
I haven't told anyone yet and tbh idk if i want to do it yet. Over the years i developed a self hate that makes me quit everything i do.
I pushed away my friends, my family i dropped college and among other things i guess that was a twisted way that i thought god was punish me or something because i've always been told that being gay was wrong and stuff and i've grown up in a  very religious family.
I still live with my parents and i love them, isnt like i dont feel loved by my family is just i dont think they would understand what im going through and thinking about this makes me sick. Im afraid that the people i most love in this world might not love me back because of who i am.
Im sad and feeling like trash most of the time and i dont want to feel that way anymore. I would be lying if i told u guys that any suicidal thoughts havent crossed my mind in all of those years. In fact i had one of those recently and that when i decided that i needed help. I dont know who i should reach out with those doubts should i look for a psychologist?
I'm not rich which limits my options i think. I dont know im so confused and afraid i feel like i dont have anyone to talk to.
I took me a long time so i could admit to myself that i'm gay. Anyways thanks for listening reddit this made me feel a bit better.

Wondering if/when/how to tell him I'm gay.

I'm with someone, not looking for anything extra-curricular.  Friends are mostly straight and having kids. We have very different hobbies and mine are, as it happens, mostly shared with straight guys, including indie music.

Late last year I ended up meeting a guy at a concert, by pre-arrangement via a music site. I didn't know it til I saw him, but we had actually met once years ago through work.

So, we saw concert, parted ways, he texted later that he had fun and would like to hang out again, either at another show or just food/drink sometime.  

Now there was no chemistry/flirting/whatever either way, nor was I looking for that, but i have no idea a.) what this guy's deal is or b.) if he realizes what mine is. I don't think we talked about it when we met the first time, and we only talked so much in a mosh pit, so it did not come up.  I'm wondering now whether I should somehow bring it up or leave it go.  If I had to guess I would think he was straight but my gaydar sucks.  He made some comments about the music that makes me thinks he'd be fine with it, but I also wonder if: 
- putting it out there randomly seems freighted, or
- the longer I wait, the more awkward it will be when it does come up.

Multiply by the number of times you’ll do the act, total them up, and if the total is &lt; 250, then you have less than a 1% chance (1 in 100) of being infected with HIV.

Kind of sex | Risk each time | Multiply by | Number of times |  |  Subtotal |
:--------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
Bottoming without a condom | 75 | X | ___ | = | ___ |
Bottoming with a condom | 15  | X | ___ | = | ___ |
Topping without a condom | 3  | X | ___ | = | ___ |
Topping with a condom | 1  | X | ___ | = | ___ |
Performing oral (giving head) without a condom | 1  | X | ___ | = | ___ |
Receiving oral, performing oral with a condom, rimming, fisting, handjob, frottage, etc. | 0  | X | ___ | = | 0 |
LIFETIME TOTAL | | | | | ____ |

Then compare the lifetime total you calculated to this table:

LIFETIME TOTAL | Probability of becoming HIV+
--------|:--------:
25 | 0.1% (1 in 1000)
250 | 1% (1 in 100)
500 | 2% (1 in 50)
760 | 3% (1 in 33)
1000 | 4% (1 in 25)
1300 | 5% (1 in 20)
1550 | 6% (1 in 17)
2600 | 10% (1 in 10)
5600 | 20% (1 in 5)
10000 | 33% (1 in 3) 
17000 | 50% (1 in 2)

## Examples

Suppose I’ve just come out, gotten on grindr and plan to hook up once a week.  I’m going to bottom, but will insist my partner wears a condom.  So over the next two years, say, I’ll bottom about 100 times (2 years X 50 weeks).  Bottoming with a condom has a risk of 15, so 100 X 15 = 1500.  From the above table, a total of 1550 is a 6% chance of getting HIV (about 1 in 17).  That's kind of high, so maybe I should get on PreP or consider safer alternatives (e.g. FWBs instead of hookups).

On the other hand, if I only bottom once a month with a condom, and exchange blowjobs 3 times a month, the total over 24 months would be 24\*15 + 24\*3\*1 = 432, so I’d only have less than a 2% chance of getting HIV.

If I exchanged blowjobs once a month, and handjobs/frottage 3 times a month, over two years my total would be 24, or about a 0.1% chance (1 in 1000) of getting HIV.

Suppose I plan to hookup twice a week and bottom with a condom, for the next ten years, and I'm not going to use PreP.  Then the total would be 10 years \* 100 times a year \* 15 = 15000, so I’d have almost a 50-50 chance of becoming HIV positive.

## Remarks

On average, having a single hookup where you bottom *without* a condom (75) is roughly the same risk as five hookups where you bottom *with* a condom (5 \* 15 = 75).  Condoms in themselves are an effective barrier against HIV, but the numbers given here reflect the risk from condoms slipping off, leaking around the base, getting nicked, breaking, etc.   Reported failure rates for condoms used in anal sex vary widely (e.g. 0.5% to 8%), and studies of heterosexual sex have found that even without a noticeable condom failure, traces of semen can be found in the vagina 2% of the time.  The actual risk with some partners can be much lower, e.g., it is much safer to bottom for someone who is sober, experienced using condoms, and is using an extra-strength condom.

These numbers don’t apply if you’re on PreP, in a monogamous relationship, or if you have a small number of sex partners (e.g. FWBs).  It’s designed to estimate the risk of getting HIV from hookups, where each sex act is performed with a different partner.

You can revise the risk numbers downward if you screen sex partners to find those less likely to transmit HIV, e.g., they are on PreP; they are tested regularly and have had few hookups since their last negative test; they are HIV+ but without measurable viral load.

## Technical notes

The risk numbers are calculated as 17328\*log2(1-a\*b), where a is the estimated proportion of the gay population who engage in hookups and have a measurable HIV load, and b is the per-act estimated transmission probability given a partner with measurable HIV load.  When you add the risk numbers, you’re multiplying the probabilities of remaining HIV negative.  The constant 17328 is chosen so that oral sex = 1.  The transmission probabilities used were 1.5% (bottom no condom), 0.3% (bottom with condom), 0.065% (top no condom), 0.013% (top with condom), 0.02% (receptive oral no condom).  The estimate a=0.2 was used for the proportion of the gay population who engage in hookups and have a measurable HIV load.

I never met this kid, but for some reason I enjoy texting, skyping and snapchatting. I know he leaves to California mid February. I know I shouldn't get attached to someone when I know there isnt any future.

Not sure why I always seem to put myself here. 

Last time I spoke to this guy was yesterday morning and he wrote he will talk to me soon... ever since that last message he reads and opens my snapchats and he just never responds. 

I thought he was cool, I wouldn't have minded to be friends. Cool to have a friend out in California... just sucks you know. Many will say you shouldn't get attached when never met but we speak and have so many different contacts its like I got to know him well...

I need to somehow start forgetting him because I can have a great and when I get an ignored message it puts me in a shitty mood. 

I just would like to meet him once before he leaves I guess. I know for certain him and I wont be together possibly not even friends.

He probably is feeling feeling mixed feelings about leaving. Hes leaving his best friend of 7 years and family to start a better career in California. Who am I to him? Just someone he liked on tinder which made us a match. 

His instagram is pics and quotes of how excited he is leaving and thats where his heart is but how sad it is to leave his loved ones.

Right now im definitely just writing without a clear thought of exactly what I want to say. I want to tell him what does he want to do with me stop talking or what. But I feel if I keep ir silient maybe things later in the future may be better and possibly will want to be friends. If I ever do visit California he would show me around or if he comes back he would want to see me.

Yea im definitely coming off as crazy and desperate but im confused and just want someone to tell me what to do because I always find myself putting me into tight spots all the time and need better guidance and have someone open my eyes to reality.

I'm not really sure how to explain this, so I'm going to do my best. To start, I'm 24 and as you can probably tell by the title, I'm actually close to coming out now that I've finally accepted myself. The problem is, I am very confused in the sense that if I do come out, that I'll somehow be ""attracted"" to girls again. I'll try to explain.

This is all new to me and I didn't actually ""find out"" that I truly did like guys until less than a year ago. I've experimented and what not and know that I like guys and can fall for them emotionally as well. However, the confusion lies with the fact that up until a year ago, I pretty much perceived myself as ""straight"". I would have crushes on girls and have been on dates with one (a few dates with just one girl) a little over a year ago.

When I was roughly 14, I remember randomly sitting home one night and saw a picture of a naked guy online and thought to myself ""I like that"" and thought I was gay for about a few days or so before I freaked out and I guess pushed that behind me. Everything was normal, however, and I'd always ""like"" girls all throughout high school. I never kissed one or did anything with them because I was too shy/scared, but thats beside the point. When I was 16, I started getting off to guys (online) and again, I guess I just thought it was normal and carried on liking girls. I don't remember really checking out guys in person, so you can imagine the confusion. Then, when I was 17 (senior year), I again, still liked girls, but started noticing a few guys in my classes and really wanted to ""do things"" with them. But again, I had these feelings, but never acted on them and things carried on as normal yet again. However, I was always upset that I never ""got"" girls and that continued up until somewhat recently.

Fast forward to a year ago when I was 23, just got Grindr and started meeting guys (I was terrified!). I basically have come to realize that I like guys. But, why is this all coming to fruition now? I am beyond confused. Was I denying myself all of these years? I don't have any interest in girls anymore. I remember reading posts on here from people stating that they went through a gay phase and now they're straight again (and I was hoping that would apply to myself,  but no longer want that), which made me even more confused. And now, I'm close to coming out, but I'm having thoughts that are messing with me. If I come out, what if I start to develop an attraction to girls again (since I have been ""used to"" that for so long)? I really don't want that and just wish I was sure of myself. 

I just am finding this more difficult than ever. I know most people figure this out early. Did I do that, but denied myself so much that its all coming out now? Any any help would be appreciated. I feel like I've wasted so much time and just want to be me. :(","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi :),&lt;/p&gt;

I remember reading posts on here from people stating that they went through a gay phase and now they&amp;#39;re straight again (and I was hoping that would apply to myself,  but no longer want that), which made me even more confused. And now, I&amp;#39;m close to coming out, but I&amp;#39;m having thoughts that are messing with me. If I come out, what if I start to develop an attraction to girls again (since I have been &amp;quot;used to&amp;quot; that for so long)? I really don&amp;#39;t want that and just wish I was sure of myself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just am finding this more difficult than ever. I know most people figure this out early. Did I do that, but denied myself so much that its all coming out now? Any any help would be appreciated. I feel like I&amp;#39;ve wasted so much time and just want to be me. :(&lt;/p&gt;

TL;DR I'm a midwestern masc dude, new to NYC and want to look less like a cornfed hick.

When I got it cut most recently (60$, damn this city is expensive) It looked like [this](http://imgur.com/gf47k1j) and [this from the side](http://imgur.com/1y1l4MZ)

I'm use to it pretty [short](http://imgur.com/LGlD7vh) but since I have more length now I'm thinking about keeping it but I think it needs to be cleaned up. I'm fine going short but if anyone has any longer suggestions I'd appreciate it. I've got an appointment at one of those cool barber shops where they actually know what they're doing, but it's not a style appointment so I have to have some idea going in what I want.
