I'm not the ""energetic, random, let's do stupid shit"" type of person, I act more like a 30 something year old, which is great for my job, but crappy for my age group.

But it seems like I have a hard time figuring out where to start with people my age.

How do I start an interesting conversation? How do I start my ""hook""? How do I approach someone? I know this sounds really stupid for a 19 year old to be having this problem; it's getting to the point where I'm getting depressed. 

I'm someone that prefers going to dinners, catching a movie, or chatting of coffee. I'm not a really big partier either.

I'm pretty new to this whole relationship and love thing, so my mind doesn't really know what to think or what do do... 

When I broke up with my exboyfriend, I needed a little rest of relationships. 2 months after the breakup, at the mid/end of July I met a pretty cool guy (let's call him Gary) and we hooked up every other weekend or so, like a fuckbuddy relationship or ""friends with benefits""

Now, beginning of August (so few weeks after I met Gary), I began texting with another nice guy, (call him Sean). Now the thing is, I'm surprisingly pretty interested in Sean and we get along pretty damn great. We text each other every day, and even calling each other and can talk for hours. He isn't especially searching for a relationship, but he wouldn't say no, if the right guy showed up. Why we haven't seen each other is because of the distance between our cities, as it's a 3 hour drive. 

We're literally talking about everything, make each other compliments, joking nicknames, making lists what we should do sometime, when we eventually meet and stuff. Now on the other hand, on the phone he said few times (out of the conversation) it doesn't mean specifically anything if he uses kiss smileys or compliments and so. But my mind doesn't really know what to think of this situation. 

So... I have this thing with Gary from time to time... and my question is: When I'm texting ""this way"" with Sean... is it ok from me to keep this dates with Gary alive? I mean of pretty damn course I would end it, if I would meet up with Sean and something would develop. But I'm hanging in here in between in the air and I really don't want to be an asshole. Am I overthinking a simple situation or what do you guys think of it?

so I never got acne until I went to college. It was horrible, my psyche was destroyed, confidence gone. But after a lot of work, lifestyle changes, things have gotten better! I think it's finally going away after literally trying everything, but I was wondering. What are some of your guys' secrets for keeping a good complexion?

I am aiming to go all natural down the road, and stop using all the medicine when I feel that I will never break out again (so close), but I want to hear how you guys do the skincare thing!

Here's what I currently use:

1. DON'T TOUCH UR FACE
2. 2% benzoyl peroxide cream that I leave on at night
3. Jojoba oil mixed w/ my moistuizer
4. Occasional AHA exfoliant at night

If I get an angry sucker, i'll kill it with tea tree oil and more benzoyl peroxide

We had a lot in common and after spring break we decided to continue chatting and after about three months, I have a small breakdown and start telling myself I'm straight and there's no way I could like a guy. This was incredibly far from the truth and even though I could see right in front of me that I liked this guy, I ruined it by telling him we shouldn't talk anymore. Through the years I continued to think about this guy off and on.

About two weeks ago, he randomly texts me saying he's driving through my town on the way to a road trip with his friend. Ever since then, he's been on my mind. I thought I ruined it by cutting things off when I was younger and much more stupid, but after texting him a bit, I decided to tell him I'm coming to his town to spend a weekend with him and his friends. The college he's going to is having their home coming and we're going to watch the game on Saturday and go out to some bars on Friday.

That's my hopeless romantic side. My logical and rational side is telling me that I'll go down there and I'll start developing a crush for him and he'll feel guarded (rightly so) and won't feel like a chance is deserved to be given.

What I didn't expect was a cousin of mine (who is gay) messaged me and told me that he found it to be homophobic.  

I apologized to him and removed the comment, but it got me thinking.  Was this comment really homophobic?  Yes, I'm straight.

To set some background:  My cousin and I have never really met as we live on opposite coasts.  He's barely 22 and, I think, still only a couple years out of the closet.  I would like to attribute the whole thing to him being overly sensitive, but I'd like to make sure I wasn't being the asshole here.  Wouldn't be the first time.

The air has been cleared, as near as I can tell, and the whole thing is just another reminder for me to be mindful of things throughout the day.

Has a heart of gold but does he like me? How can I tell?

There's this guy, we'll call him Dash. I've known Dash for years, since 6th grade, but never really been that good of friends. We hung out on occasion in highschool but we didn't really run in the same friend group but we remained friends none the less.

I came out in December of last year to my family but this summer to everyone else so it's made its rounds and people know. We've kept up over the past year and a half by hanging out every month or so and a few weeks ago we were talking about dancing partners and whatnot and he casually dropped he didn't mind if he dancing partner was a guy or a girl. *DING*

A huge light bulb went off in my head and I couldn't comprehend anything for a few seconds and everything that came out of my mouth for the next few minutes made me sound like a blubbering idiot because I have always had a straight-boy crush on Dash since I met him in the 6th grade. He's so sweet, charming and handsome. Hes a genuinely good person and I'm lucky to call him a friend.

That same night, he invited me to a concert that weekend which I don't chalk up as unusual as we both love EDM and he seams more insistent that we hang out more often. I invited him to go see a movie and he agreed but I never made it official it was more of a ""wanna go see xyz later?"". Then my car broke down and I was actually on my way to go hang out with him so I called him and he came to get me, we hung out and that whole bit but he had to work and needed to get to bed so he took me home, i thanked him and went inside.

I think I'm reading too much into it but I'm hoping someone sees something I don't. I know I shouldn't take his coming out as an ""i want to date you"" but what are you supposed to do when you figure out that your crush since forever is bi?

Since I probably need to spend a little bit more time on this. What are some ways that I might be able to tell whether or not he's into me?

So I've been out for a while (2 years in February) and my family was 100% supportive. However, it almost feels like I didn't come out just because I or they never seem to ask or talk about it. It doesn't bother me, but I was just wondering if anyone else is in the same situation as me?

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;ve been out for a while (2 years in February) and my family was 100% supportive. However, it almost feels like I didn&amp;#39;t come out just because I or they never seem to ask or talk about it. It doesn&amp;#39;t bother me, but I was just wondering if anyone else is in the same situation as me?

It's my friend. Here's what happened.

summary: friend was forced to admit to everyone that he is gay. what to do next?

A few months ago, my friend (let's call him Phil) came out to me. I was happy for him and he gave me a hug. He told me not to tell anybody else because he wanted to be the one to tell his friends and family. I promised I wouldn't tell a soul and that was that.

Some time later we were talking and i asked if he had come out to any one else and I learned that, no he hadn't yet and ""why should I do that, it's none of their business"". that made me sad.

At the weekend, a group of friends and I went out to the pub. Phil was there too. It was getting late and we were all a bit inebriated, except for me because I had to work in the morning, so I remember this part well. 

They were talking about their dating lives and one of them was asking Phil if he was seeing anyone at the moment. He wasn't. The conversation evolved to them asking if he was gay. He became flustered, hesitated a while, and denied it, but he did a really shit job at it. It wasn't convincing at all. It was clear that he was not ready to come out yet. This was making me cringe so I tried to change the subject/get them to stop ganging up on him, but as usual, nobody ever listens to me. They kept on trying to pry an answer out of him. Finally, he caved in. 

At least they were supportive (note: one of our mates said ""I still love you even though you are gay"". I am sure he didn't mean to say it that way). 

poor lad, I don't like that they put him on the spot like that. He should be in control of who knows and who doesn't know but they took that decision into their own hands and dragged him out of the closet instead. Asking a closeted person ""Are you gay??"" can be very scary. I would have been mortified if I were in that situation.  

But perhaps this will encourage Phil to come out to more people? He now knows that he has support. Well, a proper ally wouldn't force a queer person out of the closet in the first place, so that's debatable, isn't it.

I want to talk to him about it and see how he's doing since then, but I'm nervous that it will upset him if I bring it up.
