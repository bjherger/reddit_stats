First: I pay a amazingly cheap rent.

Second: I met Kevin at school and when my last roommate decided to move to Italy, they had an empty room in their house and let me rent it. I've always know that Kevin was flirty and more outgoing than Brad, (and I know they're in an open relationship) but lately Kevin had been getting handsy, a lot more handsy then usual. 

I've repeatedly told him to stop, but I'll admit there have been a few times I was drinking and I really didn't care so I let him touch. This past month it's been getting out of hand, again I've told him to stop, and I told him I didnt mind making a scene. 

Just this night he prettying threatened to kick me out because he has a FWB wanting to stay here. I texted him back, ""fuck you"", thinking he couldn't be serious. But his next text clarified that he was serious.

So then I came out of my room and called him out of his room, I verbally clarified with him that he wasn't  just fucking with a lay, he was fucking with my life, that I don't have the money to spend on a expensive apartment, and that most of my money is going to school right now. 

As of now I'm treating him as a landlord and that's it... 

...but I seriously don't know what to do. How the fuck do I explain to my parents/family that I need to move because I'm being harassed? My parents aren't even in a good situation to help me move financially or geographically.

Most of my young life I never questioned my sexuality, I always thought I was straight. I liked straight stuff like hockey, muscle cars, and steak (damn steak is awesome) so I never really even considered that I wasn't. I suppose from a young age I had a false understanding of what ""gay"" was, talking in a high pitch voice, say fabulous and that kinda stuff, so I just thought ""well I don't do that stuff so, I'm not gay"" case closed.

As I got older I never really showed any interest in dating girls, I suppose I just didn't pay much mind to it. when I was going through puberty I started to feel attracted to other guys in my classes, I blamed this on the out of control hormones that come with puberty and just ignored those feelings. 

I am now well out of puberty (19 in my senior year) and have had these feeling ever since. About four months ago I met an awesome girl who was really into me, we had a lot in common so I figured I would give dating a shot and see what all the fuss was about. I thought it would be nice but I am in no way physically attracted to her and whenever we make out or cuddle or whatever I just end up staring at my watch and waiting until she's done. I like hanging out with her (like I mentioned we have a lot in common) but it makes me really uncomfortable whenever we do anything. 

I am, at this point, sure I am gay. I have only mentioned how I feel to my mother and was so relieved when she supported me. I would pretty much feel comfortable with coming out of the closet publicly, I'm only afraid of people I know viewing me differently or treating me differently. I don't have any friends who are homophobic and I don't think any of them would really care, but you know, irrational uncertainty.

Right now I really feel terrible about leading this girl on. She has a great sense of humor and is very kind, so I'm not too afraid of loosing her as a friend. Hopefully it will be the kind of thing we laugh about in a few years.

By October we were exclusively dating. In December I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said he felt that he was almost ready, but wanted to wait a little longer (which I was fine with because I knew this was all knew for him and hey it's just a label and I knew we already were that to one another), but then I asked again not too long after only because the emotions were caught up and it felt right and again he answered almost. In January he literally brought up the idea of us living together one day (maybe even soon). That night he told me that he is ready to ask me to be his boyfriend, but he wanted it to be special and not ""everyday/typical"" so to speak. Especially since he already considers us together anyways. There have been COUNTLESS opportunities since then and he hasn't asked. He admitted to me that there have been multiple times where he almost asked but he felt like it wasn't special enough or something went wrong (like for instance one night he was going to, but then my brother came home or like he was going to at Dland on the last ride but then the park closed early). Well, now it is February. I asked him recently, ""Hey so I know you told me you're ready to be boyfriends and you are waiting for something special, but I wanted to check with you if that is what you want. Are you actually nervous or scared?"" He said he wasn't. He said in December he was a bit, but now he isn't at all. I said that even though originally it was awesome that he told me he was ready and wanted to, unfortunately every time I'm with him now I constantly think it's going to happen and I get disappointed that it doesn't and I was starting to wonder if maybe he wasn't ready but wanted to be. He reassured me he was ready. This last weekend we were at a bar. He got drunk and told me how into me he was and how we were on the same level and even though he doesn't say things as much as I do he really likes me and is just as into me. We've talked about camping one day and he decided that he would take me for Valentine's weekend. So here's the thing guys. I am REALLY anxious. Like I feel like I'm starting to fall in love with him, yet I for some reason have this feeling that after camping this Valentine's weekend I am going to be disappointed. I'm scared that for some reason he won't ask me. Like it's gone from being cute (aww he wants it to be special) to like this isn't a f'n proposal and you said you are ready and want to so it's weird now at this point that you haven't done it. I'm scared we'll come home and he didn't ask. At that point I would have to tell him ""hey, like either there is major miscommunication between us or else you aren't making enough of an effort to do something simply because I would find it special."" You said you were ready and were waiting for the perfect moment. Well it's here buddy. Why didn't you take it? I feel like I need to look out for myself and I deserve what I want which is a guy to WANT to ask me to be his boyfriend. I know Valentine's hasn't passed and apart of me is expecting the worse, even though I also realize that he might step up and finally officially ask me, but I feel like I need some advice at this point.

I think it's probably best if I list the big signals (that I've picked up on anyway) -

Positive: 
- We were out with friends at a club recently and I wandered off for a bit, he texted me to come back and dance, I carried him to a friends and he held my hand while I helped him to sleep (but he was quite drunk)
- All the time we spend together, every night after work he will ask to play and has declined to play with (more-skilled) friends and has instead chosen me.

Negative:
- Asked him to do something outside of work 1 on 1 other than game (we live in different places and he commutes in) and he declined due to it being 'winter' and 'cold'. 

He's been through a lot - unfortunately common coming out pains and bad experiences with guys he's been with and this makes it hard for him to trust people, as well as giving him low confidence to the point where he even stated to me if he liked a guy he'd never tell them. I generally try to compliment him when appropriate, give subtle hints (which others have picked up on) but still, not much in response other than the occasional compliment back (when I force it out of him). I also had some difficulties with my ex (infidelity on both our parts which I'm worried reflects poorly on me considering). 

I never thought I'd never develop romantic feelings like this for a guy as it's only ever been sexual interest in men up till this point which is making this whole thing particularly confusing. Anyways, most friends (including co-workers) think I should just tell him and see what happens, a lesser opinion has been to be patient and see what happens - thoughts on how to approach this?

&lt;p&gt;I never thought I&amp;#39;d never develop romantic feelings like this for a guy as it&amp;#39;s only ever been sexual interest in men up till this point which is making this whole thing particularly confusing. Anyways, most friends (including co-workers) think I should just tell him and see what happens, a lesser opinion has been to be patient and see what happens - thoughts on how to approach this?  &lt;/p&gt;

**Background**

* I'm a college guy, 22, not out and live in a fraternity, so there's no feasible way for me to bring home some ass without outing myself

* I'm bored and horny, so I browse dating apps looking for someone to host discrete fun

* Get reply from guy, seems cool, and he eventually attached face/body/cock pictures

* Guy is really hot, BUT... He's a guy in my major and most of my classes

**Problem**

I've never come out to anyone I know; the only people that know I like men are the strangers on dating apps. I haven't shown him a face pic yet...

On one hand, he has expressed interest, and I find him attractive. On the other hand, what if he doesn't find me attractive or has the same concerns I do? Then I have to deal with knowing someone in 80% of my classes A) knows I'm into dudes and B) doesn't like me himself.

What do I do? I feel obligated to respond..

**EDIT:**
Well, I decided to send him a face pic, and he stopped responding. Cooooool.

I met both of my exes on grindr and both ended pretty badly for me. Both were not ready to be with one person which I understand (its grindr but it still sucked). So i said f*ck that and deleted my grindr and abstained for a minute. 

I went to pierce my nose last weekend and a tattoo artist recognized me from my IG (@gpetess lol) so I found out he was gay and asked him out. We have a date tonight and I want to do something that will leave a lasting impression that doesnt involve my dick.

 I guess I'm asking does anyone have any suggestions for gifts or something. I wanna take him to a food place but its the first date I've ever asked someone on. Any help is appreciated

I'm only 28 and now i have to take pills for the rest of my life and change my lifestyle.

''It's not the end of the world'' you might be thinking, but this is just one of all the things that make my life miserable.

Let me explain it better:

-I'm gay -in the closet
-I live with my homophobic family in a homophobic and stupid country in Latin America.
-I've never had a boyfriend.
-I have an average body and look. not fat. not skinny. nothing special and my skin colour is black. I think i'm ugly.
-No friends *or not REAL FRIENDS*
I hang out with people who woudn't like the real me, so i need to be fake in order to earn some love from them.
-I haven't finished my career beause i don't have any motivation.
-For that reason i get a shitty salary wich doesn't allow me to move out on my own.
-And now i am sick.

FUNNY, ISN'T IT?

I feel like my entire existence is a HUGE mistake.

Life is so f****** unfair. people die every day, people with goals, with a real life to fight for.
So many people right now fighting Cancer or AIDS while i am living for nothing.
I'm not even ''living'' i'm just filling space in the Earth and catching air. You know what i mean.

I can't help feeling less than:

-Less than boys with a hot body
-Less than people who lives in civilized and secular countries. You don't have idea about how much it worths.
-Less than those guys who have boyfriends and are out and proud with a strong support from their friends, parents and relatives.

I even deleted my  Facebook and Instagram accounts because all those pics of happy couples make feel worse about myself.
*I know pleople only share their 'best moments' and some of them lie on social media, but anyway, i can't help feeling like a piece of shit.

Life's just one shoot. One opportunity. And i am losing it.

I'm losing my 'best' years. I want to believe is not too late for me.

I know it's complicated.
I know most of you haven't gone through this but honestly
I've run out of answers.

Maybe you see something that i don't.

But I wonder something - 

Does that mean that when I come out they might feel less free with me? Like, will we do it again? I am not asking it because I feel horny or something when they do it but I feel like it's kind of a thing that proves our friendship.

So, what do you think?
