The guy I've been dating and seeing for almost 3 months just ended it with me because he felt like it wouldn't be a fulfilling relationship in the long run because he's a Christian with a faithful relationship with God and I'm an irreligious atheist. Up until now, it hadn't been discussed at all -- besides a casual mention here and there about our personal beliefs and where we stand on those sorts of things. However, he said it has been eating at him for a while now. He said he placed God in the number one spot in his life and thought it wouldn't be fair to both himself and whoever he was with if he didn't have someone he agreed with about this sort of thing. I've long been of the opinion that my significant other's views wouldn't really matter much as long as he had other redeeming qualities and I liked him.

All in all this has left me with the most terrible feeling I've ever felt about a guy. I was under the impression that all was going well and I could really see myself being with this guy for the long haul. I've never really had something so serious and with so much potential. His talk with me really pulled the rug out from under my feet because it was very unexpected and I felt like there was nothing I could do to change his mind. Worse still is he kept saying how sorry he was to have to do this because he really cared about me and was happy with me. It has left me feeling very distraught.

So I guess my questions would be: how do you guys feel about this topic? Are religious views or lack of religious views so important to you that you would break it off with someone?

I know there have been other posts on this sub similar to this, but here’s my story. I hope it make me feel better to write it all down. I hope it will help me get the courage to start making the changes I need to make, in fairness to my wife and family. I’ve been lurking on this sub for several months and have come to realize this is a great community. I’m hoping for some words of encouragement and honestly, just someone to write to.

My wife and I are in our late 30’s and we have 2 daughters together. Our 17 year anniversary is today, and it’s weighing so heavy on me that I feel nothing romantically for her any longer. I have to pretend to have a good time tonight and that I love her. I’m not going to break any bad news to her on that day. And I do love her very much. She is a kind soul and loves me deeply. But I can’t love her back the same way.

I think I’ve denied my sexuality since middle school. I’ve always found males attractive; more than females. My mom would even have accepted me if I came out to her as gay (or bi, I don’t know). But I’ve never been able to accept it in myself. I’ve always wanted to be the traditional male that dated girls. High school and college in the 90’s had a much different attitude toward gays, at least here in the midwest, I think. I look around today and I see so many men come out early and it seems so common. Fraternity brothers who have gay members and nobody seems to care. It blows my mind. A gay student in my dorm room was nearly beaten by the other guys for bringing a guy into his own room (he had no roommate). I couldn’t even contemplate being out or accepting myself as a gay person. I convinced myself that I was mostly straight. The homosexual feelings I had were just a part that could be buried, ignored. It was a spectrum right? I could ignore the gay side, and focus hard on the feelings I did have for my gf (wife now). We did have strong feelings for each other early on, but maybe it was just the idea of having a good looking gf.

As I’m approaching 40, I’m having a bit of a midlife crisis. Last summer, I reached out to an old friend I knew in middle school. In HS, things went bad between us. We did painful things to each other to try to gain the favor of other students we perceived as the cool group. Reuniting 24 years later felt amazing. I apologized for my part in it and he did the same. It was a relief to shed that grudge I’ve carried. And now, we get together every time I go back to my home town to visit my parents.

The latest part of my midlife crisis is the fact that burying my true sexuality is becoming punishingly difficult. I can’t seem to do it much longer. I seem to have an immense ability to bury feelings and swallow pain, but it is finally breaking. And I feel a door closing. I’m 39. I’m in decent shape and I feel like I’m good looking enough. I’m not a knockout and I’m not ripped, but I’m ok. I’ve been losing some extra weight this summer. Only 6 lbs so far, but another 10 or so and I’ll be “toned.” But, I can’t help but feel time is running out. I look young “enough” that I may have a shot with some attractive guy out there. I really hope, but I don’t know. But if I keep waiting, that door will close. Of course I desire a sexual encounter with another man, one that I find attractive. But I also desire to meet gay friends and find out what it’s like to be part of that community. I have no idea what I’m doing. I’m lost.

I’ve never done anything sexually with another man in person. Some weird part of my brain is afraid that if I leave my wife I won’t have any luck with men and I will be alone. That doesn’t make any true sense. I already am alone. But I have played around with guys on webcams and skype. I feel so guilty sneaking around doing this at night. I have to stop this shitty behavior. I installed Grindr and was surprised and immediately addicted to texting with other guys. 1 pushed really hard to get me to meet him at a hotel. Another, much hotter, was willing too, but was a little less enthusiastic. It was not difficult to get several men interested. I was blocking or ignoring most of them. I’m sure this is nothing new for most readers of this sub, but it blew my mind. It went too far, I cancelled the hotel hook up and deleted the app and profile. I just couldn’t push the sneaking around that far.

I know what I need to do guys. I know I need to tell my wife the truth. It will absolutely destroy her. It will crush my kids. It will crush me financially. I’m not ready to be outed in the process of this. I know the right thing to do, but damn it is difficult to face. So damn difficult. But writing this post out is my first attempt to get the courage to do it. 

My second step is to come out to my best friend (straight and has a gf. Could’t be more straight). We’ve been friends for over 30 years. I’m not worried about him not accepting me, but it still doesn’t make it an easy conversation. He and I were at a bar tonight for a happy hour. We were talking before the other guys showed up. He knows something is weighing deeply on me. He asked several times what is wrong. I told him I couldn’t talk about it there. It wasn’t the right situation. He pressed harder and I told him it’s not that I don’t want him to know, it’s that I would get too upset if I told him there. Later after he left, he sent me this text:

“I love you. You are a brother and more to me. I am the friend that helps you bury a body man, so whatever is going on, just know that I have your back.”

I responded it’s something I just need to get off my chest. He responded he is extremely worried about me. 

I texted back that it’s going to sound awkward and wrong, but “I just need a shoulder to cry on.” He responded it’s not awkward or wrong at all.

Unfortunately, he has family coming into town this weekend, so there is no opportunity to talk in person alone. It will have to wait. I will be a mess when it all comes spilling out. It has to be the right situation.

I hope after that, I can find the courage to move forward and start making the changes I need to make. Thanks for reading guys. I’m having a real hard time.

Update:
Thank you guys for the responses. It is really lifting me up. The more I think about it, I want to see a professional to work through my feelings and have a plan in place. It wasn't something I was considering until I posted this. You are an awesome community.

His contact is a lot more short and direct than it used to be when we text.  He also stopped being affectionate towards me.  Used to always put arms around my shoulders, hug me, cling to me, but it has stopped yet he still does the same to other people.  I think he now sees me as some pervert who just wants to hook up with him l, but doesn&amp;#39;t want to hurt my feelings.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m trying to focus on other things to get mind off him, but he&amp;#39;s still there in the back of my mind as I resist the urge to text him just to see what&amp;#39;s up.  I want to remain friends, but I want him to know that I may need time to get over things without appearing as some desperate guy.  I hope he also can understand how unrequited lust/infatuation feels.&lt;/p&gt;

First of all I know the concept about tops and bottoms, so I guess my first question would be are relationships typically a top and a bottom or another variation? Now the real root of my question is this, once in a steady relationship how do you determine sexual roles? If its a top and a bottom are those roles set in stone? If switching occurs what is the frequency? What if both guys are in the mood to be the bottom or the top what happens? 

I guess its just hard to wrap my head around it because in heterosexual relationships the only variation that comes into play is dominate vs submissive, on a very general scale.

Just for the thrill of it and to see how it feels. This is a fantasy I had and it doesn't excede the sexual level; I'm not even sure I'd call myself bi. Maybe bi-curious if this means wanting to experiment with this kind of thing without going further.

Anyway, a close friend of mine is gay and has come out a few years ago yet hasn't had any sexual encounters with other guys. Lately, I've been thinking about asking him to fulfill my fantasy, but I don't know how he would react to this and I don't want this to affect our friendship. I've never had sex with a friend, male or female, so I don't know how it would go after, if it would become akward between us or anything like that.

On the plus side, I think I'd be more comfortable with him than with someone I'd meet in a bar or via Grindr. He appears to me as pretty confident about his sexuality and we discussed about this (not the dick sucking fantasy, just being gay in general) and he seemed pretty open and relax. I could also be sure that it would be safe. Plus I've heard he has a huge cock.

Also, if you believe this could be feasible, how should I go about it?

After a few more minutes of making out, the mood dissipated and we started to cuddle. After 10 minutes he yelled me that I should leave, I should have told him this before we started cuddling. I was mystified. I've hooked up with guys before and they've kind of shrugged it off. He seemed profoundly upset that I wasn't upfront about my diabetes in our NSA cuddling arrangement. At one point he literally compared it to having HIV. His over the top reaction aside, do I have a responsibility to tell every guy I like in the first five minutes about my diabetes? It's something very personal for me. I won't lie if I'm asked about it and do divulge when it becomes relevant but I worry that simply walking up to a guy and saying, ""Hi, my names is Igotsthebeetus and I have diabetes,"" will turn off any future interest a guy might have.

As someone who majored in writing, it makes me cringe, but nevertheless, it is a legitimate question I am curious about.

Anyway, I graduated from college last May, moved from Brooklyn to San Francisco (which is where I grew up), found a good paying career type job, found an apartment that I love, have a solid friend group and feel like I have everything in the world to be happy about.  The problem is that on a day-to-day basis, I find myself wondering if this is what I want to do with my life, and if this is what I'm living for (by ""this"" I mean the current state that my life is in).  

How do other gaybros find happiness in their lives, specifically those who have graduated college and are full fledged adults?  I don't know if I'm depressed or what, but the mundanity of everyday life is starting to get to me, and I'm constantly wondering if everyone feels this way, or if they are okay working 9-5 jobs and sort of settling in a way.

I should note that I have a really strong support system, and live close to my family, and am in no way thinking of self-harm or anything, but I am feeling a little lost and I'm curious if this is a normal post-grad funk that happens to a lot of college graduates.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;First off - I want to apologize for the dramatic title.
