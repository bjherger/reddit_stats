I'm a guy in my thirties and for the last few years my life has been dominated by health problems. I've been diagnosed with a rare condition that's difficult to treat but thankfully I'm much better than I used to be. When it's bad imagine feeling constantly crappy and weak like some kind of perma-flu. I have absolutely no idea what the future holds for me though. Despite that, I'm thinking about trying to start dating.  
  
My condition mainly affects my organs and nervous system so it wouldn't necessarily be immediately apparent that I had health problems if we met. In fact I've been pretty good at hiding them as much as possible from my friends and family. I can do stuff again but I definitely still have a very limited energy supply.  
  
Before these problems I'd probably have been reasonably desirable: pretty good jobs, okay looking, good body, tall, strong and sexually dominant top/vers with a big dick. Talking of which, the drugs I'm taking and possibly my condition have given me erection problems. The usual ED drugs are too risky for me, so I'd probably have to inject drugs into my penis to have sex.  
  
**Is it worth me even trying to date? Is it fair of me to even seek to date anyone? If so, when should I reveal that I had health issues? Should I be really explicit straight away? Please feel free to give your thoughts more generally and don't be afraid of hurting my feelings either. Thanks in advance.**","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Guys,  &lt;/p&gt;

We both go to the same university. We met in a pretty unconventional way. On the day we met, he gave me his number and I texted him later that night and asked if he wanted to hang out, which he said he did. I went over to his place and we talked for a few hours and ended up having sex. After that, he dropped me off at my place. It's about 2:30am by then. This happened about a month ago. 

We didn't communicate with each other for almost a month after our first initial encounter. He texts me out of the blue last week and asks if I wanted to come over. I go over and again, we hang out in his room and talk for a few hours before ending up having sex. We really connected on an emotional, mental, and physical level during this second time we met up. Now, I definitely have a huge crush on him. 

I'm sure he likes me as well based on the things he's said while we talked and his texts. The thing is, I don't know where to go from here. He will reply to my texts immediately after I send one, but after 5 or so texts, he'll stop replying all together. I stop replying too to not seem so desperate or something. I like to wait for him to initiate texts since the last message we sent was from me. 

Should I ask him if he wants to hang out this weekend? The next time we do meet up, I'm planning on bringing up the topic of me liking him or us dating. I don't know...

I've never been in a relationship before and this guy will be only the second guy I've ever had a crush on. The first guy I crushed on, I realized he didn't feel the same way, so I quickly got over that. I just don't want this second guy to be the same because I'm 90% positive he likes me.

Explanation: I wanted readers to see the photo without any info to get a first impression. This is the first photo I took, no selecting for my favorite shot. I'm a trans guy and had surgery to remove breasts, which included nipple grafts. I think my nipples healed somewhat irregular; here are the irregularities that I notice:

* shape is oval and tilted

* size is slightly large compared to most guys

* one is a bit larger than the other

* on the left side in the photo, the actual nipple (not areola) is very small and off center. this is more obvious [here](http://imgur.com/YJdZarB)

* sometimes I feel like the positioning should be more lateral (to the sides), but other times I feel like it's fine

I had tattooing to cover the scars of the surgery, and I'm pretty happy with that, but I still worry about the irregularity of my nipples. Is this something you'd notice on a guy, and if so how would you feel about it? Or am I being overly concerned?

Well I guess this is the update to said post. 

So I cautiously downloaded Grindr, promptly received some messages of the sexual nature, panicked, and deleted the app. 

Well apparently two of my friends from college (Mike, Alex) (whom are gay, and dating) were looking to spice up their bedroom. I told them early on, because I trusted them, so they have known for about 6 months. Well two weeks ago they messaged me with the proposition of joining them on the weekend. I excitedly accepted the offer. I did some serious butt prep that week, because they had expressed interest in there being topping and bottoming for all three of us. So the Saturday came, and so did we :P. The experience was great 10/10 would do again. The butt prep really helped,as there was minimal discomfort. Thankfully, neither of them was more than 6 inches so my ass handled it well.

However, a possible problem has started to unfold. One of them (Mike) has started to text me way more than is usual. I should add that both of them expressed interest in doing the whole thing on a semi regular basis. Mike's text messages have become more and more flirty. Now there was some sexting before the threesome, but it was always very clear it was both of them together. Now I am pretty sure it is just Mike. 

So I know I really need to figure out what is going on. My questions are as follows. Does Mike's behaviour seem sketchy? Am I looking into too much? Should I talk to them both about this, or just Mike? 

*Update- I sent a message to Mike making it clear that I was only comfortable with the flirting via text if Alex was also involved. He has received said message, but has not responded yet.

&lt;p&gt;Another thing he does, he&amp;#39;ll say things like &amp;quot;our house together&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;our future kids names&amp;quot; I don&amp;#39;t think he is being 100% serious when he says things like that, but why is he saying this so soon? We don&amp;#39;t even fully know each-other? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know some people are probably thinking the answer is obvious &amp;quot;you&amp;#39;ve only known him for a week, stop talking to him&amp;quot; but he&amp;#39;s great, I&amp;#39;ve never met someone I&amp;#39;ve enjoyed talking to more than him. He&amp;#39;s intelligent and about to graduate university with a great degree. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What should I do here? Sorry if this came off as rambling, I appreciate any advice guys.&lt;/p&gt;

But that's totally stupid for someone like me. See i have had 2 boyfriends and the last one i had was really abusive, he was totally romantic at start but once i told him what do i do to make a living(i do sex work), he went balls. He wanted me to not break up with him but constantly verbally abused me telling me things like no one would have dated me if not for him, accused me of being mentally ill and all that.

This was 5 months ago. I certainly don't need a boyfriend. I casually have sex, and my work makes me not want to find guys because i think they'll react similar to my ex. But i can't help but feel that i want to need a boyfriend. Does that make sense? Probably not. What should i do to leave this feeling behind? Because it became something i obsess over. This is literally the only thing i can think about for weeks. I just want to go back feeling that i am just not emotionally mature and ready for a relationship.

Also, would you date a sex worker? Because that's what's on my mind for several weeks too. Why or why not?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So i really think that i need a boyfriend in my life. But that&amp;#39;s totally stupid for someone like me.
