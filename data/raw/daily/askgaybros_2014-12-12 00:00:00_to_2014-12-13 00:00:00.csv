I'll just describe my last 24 hours.
- went out with friends. No physically attracted to anyone around.
- started playing a game with this girl. I wasn't aroused at the time but later on that girl went into my fantasies and I jerked off thinking of her. 
- same with another girl. No attraction at all during my interaction, but later on...
- a random guy hit on me. No attraction at all during the whole thing, I just refused his offer. Then later I was aroused by thinking about it. 
- come back home, masturbated. I thought of those girl, that guy, and a girl that I used to know, and gay sex again. Well actually not in that order.
- I downloaded grindr, started texting some guys. Then went to feminine transexuals. Some photo were shared but I didn't feel like meeting any of those persons.
- I opened up some porn. At first gay porn, then I switched to straight. Then even some erotic comic (straight).
- I closed porn and grindr and kept texting with a girl I found on tinder.

I really don't understand myself. Usually guys consider me straight, and same goes with girls. Some people doubts of me and ask what I'm into, because my romantic-sexual life is not existent and I'm not the macho type. 
Well, when they ask, I don't really know how to answer, and I feel so insecure...

We met a long time ago on Grindr (of all the places, I know....), just a simple hook-up. I'll spare all of you the graphic details, but we fooled around a bit in his car then drove around. We parked in a Walgreens parking lot and talked for an hour or so. Someone I had barely known was spilling his guts to me. I let him talk, about his family, about how he's been used in the past, about how he's used others. Normally, this should have shot up multiple red flags, but I ignored them. 


We went back to my house, had sex a couple of times, then watched tv in the living room. We cuddled on the couch, even held hands. It felt nice, until he made the statement, ""I don't want to be in a relationship, I have commitment issues,"" blah blah blah. I thought, 'Okay. Fine.'. We came to the agreement that it would be a 'friends with benefits' type arrangement. A week later, he asked to come over. My roommate (who I had asked during the previous encounter if I could have the living room for the night) was encouraging me to invite him over. So I did. We ate pizza, played Mortal Kombat and chilled. I was sitting on the love seat, trying not to pay too much attention to him, when he came over and playfully sat on me, then wedged himself between me and the couch and held me. My roommate went to bed, we went to my room and fooled around. Again, he stated that he didn't want a relationship. 


This had happened a few more times, and each time he stated that he couldn't commit. After a while, it began to agitate me a bit. He came over, we bought him food (which he did return the favor), slept in my bed (which I ended up having to leave because, well.... the only thing I could compare his snoring to was that of a jet plane). Then, all of a sudden, the sex stopped. Now, please understand that I crave human contact. Male or female (non-sexually). I get a bit angry if I don't have it. Just the way that I am. 
I confronted him about it, which ended up in a big blow up. He quit responding to my messages, so I left it alone. Hurt, I tried everything to remove him from my mind. 


Months pass, and still not a word. My roommate's boyfriend was staying with us at this point. One day we were cleaning the apartment, and surprisingly having a fun time of it. I left my apartment to change out my laundry (the laundry room is right across from my door), and right as I walked through the door, Chris comes through the entrance door (just right of my apartment door). We practically ran into each other. My stomach dropped. He stared at me for a moment, and asked if we could talk. I poked my head back into my apartment and told my roommate's boyfriend that I was stepping out for a smoke. 


Chris began this long talk about how sorry he was, and how karma bit him in the ass when a guy that he fell for pulled the same shit he did. I'm not one to hold grudges, so I forgave him. He began coming over regularly. My roommate's boyfriend is very perceptive to pretty much any situation in any atmosphere, and instantly caught onto my discomfort. A few months go by, and my frustration hasn't eased. He still came around about once a week to hang out with us. I began to calm down, and it seemed like the moment that I did he began to get closer. My roommate's boyfriend became furious one night when he noticed Chris's playful behavior (i.e. touching my face, tickling, etc.), yet Chris never went too far. He told my roommate's boyfriend that he wouldn't make a move on me again. 


Then, lo and behold, he up and vanishes. Again. Every now and then I got a response from him, only saying that he had some shit that he needed to figure out on his own. 
He sent me a message on Thanksgiving, saying that he hoped that my roommate, his boyfriend and I all have a great weekend. I ignored him, but my roommate's boyfriend ran into him at his work. He told him that he was sorry for not keeping in contact, asked how I was, and to tell me that he hoped I was okay. 


I shrugged this off, and this time it was much easier.....until I came across his Instagram profile, which had a picture of Chris and his new boyfriend. My heart sank, and I was damn near to tears. I blocked him from everything that I could; Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, I blacklisted his number on my phone. Absolutely no contact. It's been a few days now, and I can't let this go. 


I'm sorry for the length and the poor grammar. It's 1:30 am, I've been working all day. But nothing can keep me from thinking about it. Am I wrong for feeling the way that I do? 
Do I just need to man the fuck up and get over myself? Or am I justified in feeling like I've been stabbed in the heart.

It started off great with wonderful foreplay that lasted over an hour, and then I told him that he could have a go at me as long as we switched so I could get off too.  Well, he did his thing, I'll spare more details, and then got all cuddly afterwards, while I was still riled up.  

I don't know if it was the time lag between him finishing and me convincing him to let me try (first time with a guy that was more than just fooling around), or the length of time that we were messing around and me putting off finishing, or performance anxiety, but I pretty much lost my erection when it came time to try, and despite my and his best efforts, couldn't get it back up to finish the deed.  

I'm not sure if it's in my head or what, but now I'm a bit embarrassed despite him telling me not to be, that it's my first time and a learning experience, and I even got a nice and sincere sounding text afterwards telling me not to worry about it and there's always a next time, he really enjoyed being able to spend time with me in general, and not to worry again.

He’s an amazing guy, makes me laugh, he’s educated (currently going for his BA like me), stays active (we’re both physically active and fit), we have many common interest, we’re great at communicating with each other as in we never argue (at times it seems to perfect to be true), we have similar life goals, and he’s extremely well endowed… not that it’s that important yet it is nice :3
We only have a problem when it comes to sex. He has a lot of trouble when it comes to bottoming, and he can’t stay hard when it comes to topping. It seems like he can only get off when it comes to blowjobs (which he has no problems to stay hard for [so at least we know it’s possible for him to stay hard for extended periods of time]). Blowjobs are great from time to time, yet it’d be nice to get to have sex once in a while too. Whenever he’s tried to bottom he can’t last more than two minutes (he says it’s too painful) so I have to pullout and neither of us get off from it. It doesn’t matter how slow I go and even if I don’t go all the way in he still says it’s too painful. We thought maybe after trying a couple times he’d get better at it, yet after a month it still seemed like nothing has changed when it comes to bottoming for him. So I told him to try and practice with a toy for a while and that has yet to yield any positive results. Any ideas on anything else I can have him try to overcome that?
When we first stated to be intimate with each other I wanted to be safe so we tried but he couldn’t stay hard and he blamed it on the condoms. We’ve tried many types of condoms for him and none really worked out. So I told him that I’d be fine to not use them since we’ve known each other for a long time and trust in one another after getting tested and seeing each other’s test results. Without condoms it is still an issue for him to stay hard despite position, speed, role-play, toys etc. I feel like I’ve tried everything to make sex work between us yet nothing has worked. Are there any guys that have had problems like this out there that have any advice on how to overcome it or did it stay a never ending problem for you any advice would help. At this point I feel a bit hopeless when it comes to sex with him. 
In the past, I’ve always been in verse relationships that have been about 50/50 when it came to topping and bottoming, and I’ve been in the habit of having really great sex in my past relationships. It feels as if I have traded in amazing sex for a good relationship. I feel bad to end what we have going over sex and desperately want to find a solution to it. Last time he tried to top he tried to get hard for over an hour I wish it was an exaggeration but sadly it’s true. I’m extremely sensitive to his feelings when it comes to talking with him about this, and after last time he brought up the idea of me getting to sleep with other people so I could get to have sex since he wasn’t able to. I felt horrible as I saw the tears forming in his eyes. The thing is I don’t want to sleep with other people. I’m in love with him
","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been dating my best friend for quite some time now and for the most part everything is great. He’s an amazing guy, makes me laugh, he’s educated (currently going for his BA like me), stays active (we’re both physically active and fit), we have many common interest, we’re great at communicating with each other as in we never argue (at times it seems to perfect to be true), we have similar life goals, and he’s extremely well endowed… not that it’s that important yet it is nice :3
We only have a problem when it comes to sex. He has a lot of trouble when it comes to bottoming, and he can’t stay hard when it comes to topping. It seems like he can only get off when it comes to blowjobs (which he has no problems to stay hard for [so at least we know it’s possible for him to stay hard for extended periods of time]). Blowjobs are great from time to time, yet it’d be nice to get to have sex once in a while too. Whenever he’s tried to bottom he can’t last more than two minutes (he says it’s too painful) so I have to pullout and neither of us get off from it. It doesn’t matter how slow I go and even if I don’t go all the way in he still says it’s too painful. We thought maybe after trying a couple times he’d get better at it, yet after a month it still seemed like nothing has changed when it comes to bottoming for him. So I told him to try and practice with a toy for a while and that has yet to yield any positive results. Any ideas on anything else I can have him try to overcome that?

I (29) have been trying to push forward with my boyfriend/partner (42) and resolve things, though it's been a bit bumpy, to say the least. We had some serious issues as of late, but I've been doing my best to diffuse them calmly and rationally. Issues remain, though, and I don't really know what to do or how to address it. 

Without getting into the [tangela](http://faqsmedia.ign.com/faqs/image/ani114.gif) of it, my boyfriend has sort-of admitted previously, and I now see fully, that he has problems with his anger. I also have anger issues, but I have been working with a therapist and have gotten to be pretty good about a) addressing the irrational things that make me angry (e.g. oh, it's raining? Is it the end of the world? No. Can I do anything about it? No. [Let it go](http://youtu.be/moSFlvxnbgk)), b) controlling my anger and diffusing it when it starts to get out of control and c) addressing the root cause that I have anger issues. The problem has been that as I am learning to address these things, I'm *acutely* aware of the fact of my boyfriend's anger issues, not so much in that he gets angry, but in that he takes it out on me and others around him when he is angry. 

I have noticed that his outbursts follow a well-defined pattern- something happens to make him angry (often something somewhat trivial) and he becomes absolutely enraged; he doesn't seem to have an ""annoyed"" setting on his anger-scale; it's either he's fine or he's furious. He refuses to speak to me or to anyone until he has cooled off and he becomes very aggressive, rude and petulant if he does have to interact with anyone. Once his anger defuses, he's back to his old self. As an example, last night we needed to run errands before dinner and we live in an extremely high traffic area. We left the house, needing to go to a thrift shop (yeah, I'm that Portland) to buy a gift and he needed to mail something. He didn't work out the best route to get to the mail shop or the thrift shop (we live near a major corp. headquarters in the burbs so when the work day ends, the surface streets are paralyzed for like an hour and you have to plan the route) and just started driving; he ended taking a poor route and we got immediately stuck in traffic. He freaked out and started cursing about how ridiculous the traffic is and how fucked up trying to get around is in this area, and that we were never going to make it where we needed to before the shops closed. I just tried to ignore him and suggested we take some back roads and pulled up the Google Map of the area but he angrily told me that ""those maps are always wrong about traffic and the time it takes to get places and that the traffic was just [ridiculous]."" I didn't even know what to say, so I just said nothing. We got to the mail shop about 9 minutes later (right in line with the Google estimate, I'd add), he went inside and paid, and was fine. 

I was not fine. I made every effort not to pick a fight and succeeded, but the fact of the matter is, he scares me when he is angry. Like it scares me, a lot. 

Another example, we recently moved, and an appliance in the house we are selling appeared broken (it's not); at the same time, we were also given a free cleaning lady for the move out as a gift and I instructed her in what to focus on (it was only three hours for a 1200' square house)- I had to guess because when I asked, my boyfriend just said, ""I don't know, just have her do the usual cleaning."" This was a Thursday. He went over the day after the cleaning and discovered the ""broken"" appliance, and found that the cleaning girl hadn't ""done what he expected."" He texted me that he was ""fucking irate"" over the situation at around 10am Friday, that ""he was going to have to spend every day cleaning, all weekend, to make up for the lazy bitch"" (he didn't) and when I asked him how I could help he just told me not to even bother. He then ignored my texts for the rest of the day. Normally when he does this, he shouts at me and we have a fight when I see him. I was a nervous wreck the entire day waiting for him to come home; he got home about 4 hours after me, and I was so terrified I basically just got in bed and read, waiting for him. In the end, he didn't shout at me, but he refused to talk to me, and just said, ""I don't even understand why she didn't clean any of the things we needed to get cleaned."" This pissed me off, but of course, I wasn't going to add fuel to the fire- he didn't tell me *what he needed cleaned*, and I know for a fact she cleaned a bunch of things that needed cleaning that are time consuming (fridge, freezer, pantry, over, etc). I just let it be, and went to bed and left him alone. The icing on the cake about this situation is that I tried to make sure he laid out clear, direct expectations for what he wanted the cleaner to accomplish, he didn't tell me anything as I had asked, and *then* he gets furious because she doesn't do what he expects. 

I don't know how to address this. I live in constant fear of his next meltdown because he gets pissed off over anything and everything, and when he's angry ""he can't control himself."" I feel like this is a cop out- that is, he's never learned to deal with his anger or control himself when he is angry, and so if he just prefaces everything he does with ""I can't control myself when I'm angry,"" then he has a green light to act however he wants and let his rage get out of control. 

I have tried to talk to him about this when he is angry, and it just causes a fight or he shuts down and refuses to talk about it. I have talked to him about this after the fact when he has calmed down and he either says ""he doesn't want to talk about it,"" he accuses me of waiting to long and says ""well, I don't really remember now, so why didn't you bring it up when I was angry"" or he just says ""I don't want to talk about it."" If I press the issue, he completely shuts down and won't talk about it. 

It's starting to make me absolutely insane. I have long since realized I live in fear of him and his anger, and I get it. He has anger problems. He's human. He has faults. I can accept that; we can all work to overcome out faults. The problem has shifted, though, in that (venting here) I realize that the things that set him off are unpredictable at best and often times somewhat trivial, and he refuses to talk about his anger problems or address the reasons he has them and I'm sick of it. I'm sick of having to always be in absolute control of myself around him, walking on eggshells, to keep him happy, and I'm sick of his tantrums. I can understand getting upset about an incompetent coworker, or something like that. I can't understand getting worked up over something trivial like traffic to the point he does, or worse, getting worked up over *something that's your own fault*. I joke when people ask me if I want to have kids and just say ""I have a teenage son and daughter already"" (my mother, too, though that's not about anger, thankfully, haha). I have just run out of patience with the situation so that when he gets worked up into this frothing whirlwinds, I just want to start screaming at him. 

I need help. I don't have anger issues in the same way that he does and I don't know how to approach this; being calm and rational gets me nowhere. I have done what my therapist suggests (talking about it calmly, rationally, and *when it happens, not putting it off*), and it's still getting me no where. Can someone who perhaps has been on the other side of this coin give me some insight into how I can get him just hear me, and give me insight into what (if anything) I can do to get him to start realizing this is an issue? It's killing me, and I am quickly reaching a point where I'm just going to [snap](http://cdn.buzznet.com/assets/users16/pattygopez/default/liz-lemon-problem-solving--large-msg-130567235154.jpg).

It&amp;#39;s killing me, and I am quickly reaching a point where I&amp;#39;m just going to &lt;a href=""http://cdn.buzznet.com/assets/users16/pattygopez/default/liz-lemon-problem-solving--large-msg-130567235154.jpg""&gt;snap&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tl;dr - how do I get my boyfriend to deal with his anger issues? Sorry about the wall of text. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit - put in wall of text warning and tl;dr&lt;/p&gt;

See the problem? I thought it would finally get her off my back and now she wants to meet this fake boyfriend and I just can't break it to her that there wasn't anyone in the first place.... So would someone be willing to be my fake boyfriend for Christmas? I would say we'd be together until the end of January. You will get presents and an awesome time with my family. Most likely, an awesome New Years too! Starting to get a little desperate here..... Ummm I guess I have to put a little bit of standards for physical and maybe personality and age and such. I'd like someone at least 5'10""-ish, prefer white, average to good looking, good humor, able to be liked by my parents, 20-30 years old, has a job, and a car... I am around the Northwest area, Tomball.... So please help! Comment or PM for information.
