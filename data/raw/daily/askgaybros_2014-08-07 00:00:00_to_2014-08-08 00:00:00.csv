Almost a year ago, I got back together with someone I had dated almost a year and a half before that. Things weren't perfect, but by and large, I *thought* things were great the whole time, we even ended up getting engaged. He was on my mind almost constantly for the entire duration of the relationship, I was in love like never before. Almost 3 months ago, as if a switch was flipped, suddenly he wanted nothing to do with me and ran off with someone else. I then find out he'd been flirting with/grooming other prospects on the side the whole time, and might even have cheated, as well as bad mouthing me and generally making a fool out of me. Upon further inspection, his behaviour during the entire relationship and afterwards bears MANY characteristics of HPD and NPD (personality disorders), there's a genuine possibility that his instability is pathological. But that's beside the point.

Anyhow, I decided that after what he's done, and given that the way he is will likely never change, I can't associate with him anymore. And I'm doing good so far. Deleted all messages and photos and haven't spoken to him since the day after the breakup. I notice him crossing my mind less and less, but I still can't help but worry that his memory is gonna continue to haunt me, and could somehow sabotage my attempts to have good romantic relationships in the future. I've been dating again for about a month, not heavily though, and I know I'm not quite ready to be exclusive with someone again (I'm having a hard time trusting guys, it's an effort right now), but I still find my memories of the good times with my ex crossing my mind. And it hurts, because as good as those times were, I know now they were based on lies and manipulation, so it just makes me feel like a fool. Hell, when I noticed the other day that he deleted me from Facebook (I saw him pop up in the ""People You May Know"" column), as stupid as that is, I felt a momentary pang of ""what? why?"", despite the fact that I know it's best, because I don't wanna talk to that asshole anyway.

Like, what I thought was the love of my life was never nearly that deep, yet I believed it was; I believed in it wholly and truly, devoted hours of my time, thousands of dollars and ENORMOUS amounts of thought, energy and care to him, and now I've got nothing to show for it.

See my dilemma? I'm done with *him*, but undoing what he leaves behind, that's another story. I don't wanna think deprive myself of new experiences that could be amazing or cheat myself out of enjoying moments that could be spectacular, by letting thoughts of ""how it used to be"" and anger over being mistreated in the past, ruin it for me. I'm dating again, I'm doing things with my life, I'm not giving him the time of day, I'm putting on a brave face, but am I moving forward? Or is there some crucial thing that I'm missing?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, so here&amp;#39;s the situation to this point, in brief:&lt;br/&gt;

I turned to the only thing I could think of to make any kind of contact, Grindr.

I've had it for about 4 weeks now but I never seem to get very far with anyone who talks to me.

Now, I have a face pic and I chat with however, with/without/whatevs in hopes of finding someone 'nice'. The problem is, no matter who I talk to, they always seem to disappear?

Convos usually go like:

I'll get a message and it'll be along the lines of Hey/Nice Pic/Hot/etc. and I just say hi and then we chat a bit they ask for more pics since the face pic I'm using only shows about 3/4 of my face. So I send a couple more facial shots, never body or nude or dick or whatever else it is that people might send. They'll say something back like Nice/Handsome/Good looking guy etc. and then disappear. No more contact from them whatsoever.

Am I doing something wrong? I'm completely new to this so I don't really know how to respond to the compliments so I just give a thanks. Should I compliment them back? I just feel like such an idiot typing, hot! handsome! I'm talking to you, that should be enough to indicate my interest. Am I supposed to ask them for pics in return? 

This has literally happened with every guy I get talking to that I think I'd like to meet and I'm getting a little bit disappointed.

Any advice?
