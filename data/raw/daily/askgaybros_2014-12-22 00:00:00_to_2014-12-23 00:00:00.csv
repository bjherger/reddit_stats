Were both 18, high school seniors. Hadn't known each other since this year, and had really only started hanging out in the last month or two. We are nearly the same person and hanging out just the two of us is always fun. It's pretty normal bro stuff, and I would hate to come out and lose that aspect of the friendship.

I have known I was gay for awhile, although I don't come across that way. On the other hand, I have no idea whether or not he might be. He doesnt really fit the steryotipical gay person, but he seems to flirt, and just act overall more engaged and happier with me. For instance, we could be hanging out and he will lay down right next to me when I'm on a laptop, or something where that wouldn't necessarily have been necessary. Another example, we are casually playing video games, and he slowly moves closer across the couch untill were basically leaning on each other.

I'm worried about a few things. First is that I want him to be gay too so badly that I overanalyze a lot of things, or that I'll be disappointed even if he reacts great but is straight. Another problem could be that he assumes I like him and the friendship isn't be the same. I'm just very anxious because I don't want to ruin the friendship, but he is also the person I feel most comfortable  around and think it would be a logical person to come out to first. I'm almost positive he would take it well either way cause he is a really good person, but there's always going to be be that bit of fear.

If any of you have been in a similar situation, or generally have any suggestions they would be greatly appreciated.

Anyway so here goes I guess. 

Couple days ago someone asked me if it was weird knowing my brother and best friend were dating. Which was weird, because I didn't know that my brother and best friend were dating. I also wasn't aware that either of them were gay/bi. 

I asked my brother if they were dating and he came out to me. Afterwards I felt bad because at the time I hadn't really considered what a big deal this moment would be. Weirdly at the time it wasn't the gay element that I was thinking about, it was the fact that my brother was dating my friend. Spoke to my friend later he said he's mostly attracted to guys, confirmed he and my brother were dating. I told both of them, that I wanted to be clear that them being gay is not an issue, that doesn't change how I feel about them at all. 

The fact that they were dating, and didn't tell me feels awkward though. I know that neither of them need my permission to date or fuck whoever they want, but I don't  know I still thought they'd at least tell me first? I guess thats more difficult since neither were out to me yet. I mean we've all hung out together plenty of times - my brother is only a year older than me. But to me at least its always been thats *my* brother and *my* friend - like if my friend was talking about my brother to someone I'd have thought he'd say ""that's OP's older brother"" - does that make sense? I say all that to say the fact that they both came out to each other before me feels weird. Well actually it makes me feel shitty to know I made both of them feel like they'd have to hide that they're gay. Right now they feel like 'my friend's boyfriend' and 'my brother's boyfriend', not my brother and my best friend. 

We were all suppose to hang today and because I wasn't ready to hang out with both of them yet - together or separately to be honest - I bailed. It was suppose to be a brodate, but I guess they would've had just a datedate? And I don't know why I feel this way but I do. I don't care for either of them any less but I just need time to wrap my head around this. They've both told me they want to talk about, and I do too because I definitely don't want to not be as close to either of them as I was before going forward, but i don't know how I feel about the whole thing yet. 

I don't even know what sorta advice I'm looking for. Maybe some explaining why I shouldn't feel awkward around the two of them? Maybe recommendations on good movies to watch so I don't have to leave my room tomorrow? This situation is weird right?

I have been extremely stressed out since coming out about finding a boyfriend.

5% of the population is gay if I'm lucky, so my odds of finding a gay guy are extremely slim compared to if I'm straight.

I'm just so so so incredibly frustrated and angry about how much easier it is to find a girlfriend if your a straight guy.

On top of that my hairs falling out (runs in the family), and I look way less attractive without hair. I need my hair to look attractive.

I'm just so depressed and down about never being able to find an attractive guy to date.

I don't want to date someone I'm not attracted to, I just feel like no guy will ever want to date me (if I can ever find one since its fucking hard as it is).

If I have to be alone forever and I can't find anyone for myself I don't even know what the point of me living is.

I need emotional connections with people to be happy.

Thinking about how hard it is to get a boyfriend when your gay literally ruins my life.

When I pretended I was straight at least I had a lot of girls I could flirt with and where actually viable options to date if I was straight.

Life is so fucking terrible when you're lonely. And I just get scared to use my friends because I don't want to hurt myself because I don't want to have a relationship that is wrong because I'm attracted to them. I push away friends sometimes because I'm scared I'll get too close to them. And this just leaves me so lonely.

Broke up with my girlfriend, and its the hardest thing I've ever had to deal with in my life.

Still day-by-day right now getting through the day is painful and a chore.

I have a great group of straight male friends that are supportive, including my best friend I've known since high school.

He talks to me daily, we text all the time, we hang out during the week a lot, he invites me out all the time with other people he knows and our friends.

He's one of the only people ever I've emotionally connected with and feel really good and myself to be around.

He's always willing to talk, support me, and help me out.

I really need that right now, I just feel so much better when I can just hang out and talk to someone about anything.

These are my feelings I have a lot:

1. Do I love him? Ya, I love him, but I don't think I'm 'in love' with him
2. I can hookup with other guys without feeling like I 'need him'
3. I have a really hard time with other gay guys because they can't match the emotional connection I have with him (I'd never be able to date them because I don't like them basically)
4. I don't care what he does with other girls as long as he still spends time with me, talks to me, and cares the same
5. He is really attractive, but not so attractive I can't find other guys that I think are more attractive frequently
6. I've just sort of grown to be content that its never going to happen and he's just a friend, it doesn't eat me like it used to when I first came out a year ago

I'm just scared because I do project a lot of my emotional and social needs onto him. I try to get my emotional/social fix from other people but he's the best person and gets it and always willing and enjoys talking and hanging out with me.

I feel like I'm a drug addict, for me to feel good I NEED to talk or hang out with someone I feel a strong emotional connection with.

This can be any of about 3 friends I have, but I just need someone to talk to and someone I can care about so I don't feel alone.

I love all my friends, and I LOVE talking and hanging out with people all the time. If he stopped being in my life I would be devastated.

I'm always willing to go out of my way for a friend I have a strong connection with. This is only about 3 people in my life.

I'm just scared this love and desire to be around a friend and talk to people all the time is wrong of me and that its my sexuality spilling over and its wrong.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m 22, I just recently came out last year.

&lt;li&gt;I have a really hard time with other gay guys because they can&amp;#39;t match the emotional connection I have with him (I&amp;#39;d never be able to date them because I don&amp;#39;t like them basically)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don&amp;#39;t care what he does with other girls as long as he still spends time with me, talks to me, and cares the same&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He is really attractive, but not so attractive I can&amp;#39;t find other guys that I think are more attractive frequently&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#39;ve just sort of grown to be content that its never going to happen and he&amp;#39;s just a friend, it doesn&amp;#39;t eat me like it used to when I first came out a year ago&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m just scared because I do project a lot of my emotional and social needs onto him. I try to get my emotional/social fix from other people but he&amp;#39;s the best person and gets it and always willing and enjoys talking and hanging out with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like I&amp;#39;m a drug addict, for me to feel good I NEED to talk or hang out with someone I feel a strong emotional connection with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can be any of about 3 friends I have, but I just need someone to talk to and someone I can care about so I don&amp;#39;t feel alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love all my friends, and I LOVE talking and hanging out with people all the time. If he stopped being in my life I would be devastated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m always willing to go out of my way for a friend I have a strong connection with. This is only about 3 people in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m just scared this love and desire to be around a friend and talk to people all the time is wrong of me and that its my sexuality spilling over and its wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

Been with my guy for 4 1/2 years now and things are okay. 

I am 5'8, 228 lbs and he is 5'4, 135 lbs. Recently we've been discussing our relational roles and whatnot and I told him it would be nice if he could 1) be more romantic and 2) seduce me more.

We've been trying for about 5 weeks now and we aren't seeing much progress. I asked him about it today and he said that from a top's perspective, it's easy to be romantic and seductive because you just turn on the masculine charm and act strong and bold. Stereotypical man style.

He said that as a bottom, it is really hard for him to come up with romantic things to do or seductive ways to act because 'he doesn't have tits and he can't just wave them in my face'

Could you guys give some advice/techniques that I can relay to him (He's not a redditor unfortunately)  to give him a self-esteem boost and a nudge in the right direction? I want to see his passion and desire. Thank you!!

I've been lurking this subreddit in the last few days, mostly reading other people cases and trying to apply the advices to my case. However I'm still felling the need to tell it to someone, so...

I'm the youngest son of a quite dramatic family, where my mom still somehow hold the lines into a liveable place. Between all the shit that my brother, sister, dad, etc does, I somehow turned to be the ""proud"" of my mom for simply not doing shit and taking care of my business as I should do. I'm currently 22 and since I discovered about my sexuality (16) I knew that she would accept it, but would be very dissapointed (came to that conclusion after some indirect questions), wich would result into a lose lose situation (she can't afford another deception). Aligning this with the complete stupidity of my dad around the subject and my financial dependence from them until I finish college, I decided to not tell anyone aside a few internet friends .My IRL friends were never been the most compreensible people also, leading to me slowly pushing them away from personal stuff.

The thing is, 2015 will be my last year of college and I'm shit scared of what comes next. Getting a job and a place to live will be hard things, but at least I know the directions and what to do about it. However, leaving my mask behind and ""starting to be gay"".... how the fuck does one do that? Oh, and now the aggravating factors : never told someone physically ; I'm a overral shy and reserved guy ; Not the most confident with looks (slim and pale white ;\ ).

Until now I've been so busy and distracted with the other aspects of my life (college and internship = holy shit) that only now I remembered to freak out. In fact, I  only realized that after accidentally watching a movie on TV called Shelter ,where the protagonist made me abusrdly jelly in terms of dealing with it. I know it's fiction, but...

Please help. 

I can't get it out of my head, I am freaking out, I would never EVER do such a thing. 

(Warning: Details may be offensive and gross)

A couple embarrassing details:

1.) Me and this guy have been in regular contact for 2 years now, normally what happens is I go over to his house and give him head. I like doing it for some reason, I rarely like to do anything else. 

2.) He normally calls me over when he wants it, and when I can I oblige. 

3.) He is openly gay. 

4.) The word rape hasn't been said. 

5.) This happened a year ago. 

Basically, one time a year ago, he called me up to go over to his house. I wasn't doing anything so I went. I was in the middle of giving him head and he said ""hey, do you want to top me?"" Since I knew this guy pretty well, I said ok, and I fucked him for maybe 5 minutes (He shat on my dick, so I was subtle and asked if we could stop.) 

I continued giving him head, and then when we both finished we parted ways. 


A year later, I am having a conversation with him on facebook, he tells me he is coming into state and wants me to be his ""first top."" I told him I topped him before, and he was blown away. He said he doesn't remember me topping him and continued to say, ""I must have been drugged by someone."" (I'm assuming he meant me) 

I politely told him that it is best that we don't see each other anymore, and he is extremely upset. All that keeps going through my mind is ""how does he not remember,"" and ""why the fuck did I agree to that.""

I have really bad anxiety, and I am thinking of all the worst possible situations that can arise from this. What am I to do? 

This is a throwaway account. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;EDIT: You guys are the only ones I can think of to turn to. Please help. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, one time a year ago, he called me up to go over to his house. I wasn&amp;#39;t doing anything so I went. I was in the middle of giving him head and he said &amp;quot;hey, do you want to top me?&amp;quot; Since I knew this guy pretty well, I said ok, and I fucked him for maybe 5 minutes (He shat on my dick, so I was subtle and asked if we could stop.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I continued giving him head, and then when we both finished we parted ways. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A year later, I am having a conversation with him on facebook, he tells me he is coming into state and wants me to be his &amp;quot;first top.&amp;quot; I told him I topped him before, and he was blown away. He said he doesn&amp;#39;t remember me topping him and continued to say, &amp;quot;I must have been drugged by someone.&amp;quot; (I&amp;#39;m assuming he meant me) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I politely told him that it is best that we don&amp;#39;t see each other anymore, and he is extremely upset. All that keeps going through my mind is &amp;quot;how does he not remember,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;why the fuck did I agree to that.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have really bad anxiety, and I am thinking of all the worst possible situations that can arise from this. What am I to do? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a throwaway account. &lt;/p&gt;

I've had this problem for a while. My boyfriend and I have been together for nearly two years and I really love him. I know that eventually I could see us getting married - we've even talked and joked about it.


But one problem - the sex is bad. Like, really bad. We probably have sex maybe once every two months. It sucks. I feel bad because it's not anything he's doing wrong... but he has a micropenis and it's a pretty big turnoff. I wish that it didn't bother me and I could rise above it, but it seriously kills my motivation every time we get going and I realize that there's really nothing to go ""down"" on. 

I'm 21 and I can feel myself getting restless and wanting some more action, but I don't know what to do because I don't want to leave him.

This guy and I have been talking for a month or so now. We went on a date and it was amazing. We held hands, flirted, made out. He even made sure I got home okay, going out of his way. We even made plans for him to come to NYC (he lives in Philadelphia, I go to college in Philadelphia but live in NY.) A few nights ago, he was drunk texting me and then face timed me. I think he thought he had hung up but he didn't. On it, I could hear another guy flirting with him and he flirted back. My heart sunk. I realize that we are nothing official and I have no right to get upset. I texted him (I was drunk too) and told him to have fun with the guy he was flirting with. He texted me and said he was drunk and that he was sorry. He then tried to facetime me later, which I ignored. 

The next day, he called me. I told him I was sorry for getting possessive and I asked him what we were doing he said he didn't really know and that he has too much going on in his life/future to want to be official. He also told me that when he gets drunk he gets really flirty. I don't understand why we are going on dates and texting/calling each other all the time then? It's frustrating because I really like him and I think he likes me, he just doesn't want to commit. Sorry this is so long! Do you guys have any words of wisdom as to what I should do? Should I just keep dating him and see what happens? I mean, I guess the experience could me fun. 

Edit: He is also very hard for me to read, when we are together we act like a couple, when we are apart he is kind of to the point and unromantic. A complete 180 then when we are together. Perhaps I am reading too much into it! 

TLDR: I like a guy, have gone on a few dates, I have feelings for him and I think he does for me. He does not want to commit and give us a title.
