We did some stuff at that meetup (mostly oral), but because we're both closeted virgins we didn't want to do more without being really prepared for it. The next time we're gonna meet is in around three months, and we definitely want to have sex then.


Which is exactly why I read up some stuff about preparing for doing anal for the first time, but I still don't know what's the best way to prepare. I ordered myself an [anal training kit](https://i.imgur.com/2ms0wy2.jpg), some water-based lube as well as an anal douche, but how exactly should I prepare myself so it's gonna be as enjoyable as possible for when we actually have sex for the first time? Do I just use the anal dilators every evening with some lube, do I move them in and out, do I keep them inside me for a while so I get used to the feeling?

I feel a bit like an idiot because I'm asking for the best way to put up stuff in my butt, but I'm just completely clueless about how I should go about doing that without causing any harm. I just want the time me and my friend are gonna have together to be as much of an enjoyment as possible without any pain or even worse things involved if possible.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;A little bit of backstory: Me and my best friend (not yet boyfriend, we&amp;#39;ll see if that&amp;#39;s gonna be a thing or not) met online half a year ago, we live around 600km from each other which is why we were only able to meet once so far.

This one guy started to talk to me. We had actually talked on grindr before about fooling around.

He bought me drinks (I declined because I'm a diabetic and alcohol lowers my blood sugar, but he still bought them). After that he went to his friends, so I walked near an open area.

I started to notice that not only guys around my age are interested in me, but also young American ones (I’m European). Since I take care of my body, I was quite pleased by this interest and, honestly, I started fantasizing about sex with these guys.

What I started to notice is, however, that the discussion topics were quite limited: what is your job, where you live, do you have a PS4/gaming PC, etc...
Initially I assumed that simply they didn't know what to ask to an older foreign guy, hence the standard questions. However, a college student yesterday asked if he can move in with me since he can barely afford housing.

Life in this part of the US is quite cheap and my discretionary income is, consequently, not low. This means that I can afford fairly expensive stuff (e.g. I have a 911), even if I'm not an NBA player. So, I'm starting to think that these guys are interested in me only because I appear wealthy.

How should interpret this interest? Am I just a stupid gullible guy?

So I (17mbi) have been with my current boyfriend (also 17mgay) for about six months at this point. It's by a good margin the longest relationship either of us have been in. Now I've been out for around three years and have played the field with some luck that whole time. My boyfriend (let's call him lance) is in the awkward interim of coming out to a few friends and family members so his support network is basically me and his lesbian bestie. We're both juniors in highschool naturally but we live in neighboring districts so we see eachother Friday nights, weekends or holidays (whenever we can) which is tough but manageable. 
Here inlies my dilemma: my mother (primary legal guardian- haven't talked to my dad in months) is moving from our present home in Georgia to Washington DC for work. Now while I'm happy she is so successful and doing well in her male dominated career (mother is my biggest role model) but I'm unsure of what to do about lance. We both deeply empathic committed people and so the thought of my moving away is difficult to handle of course. I've moved seven times at this point and have gotten pretty comfortable with saying goodbyes but I really think lance and I have something (I get worried if he doesn't call or text to say he loves me back before class or work). Now I've moved while in a relationship before and opted to break up just cause I've never felt this strongly about a boy (or girl) but this time I'm really not sure.
Would it be preemptive and unnecessary to break up with my boyfriend if I'm going to be gone for months at a time for at least a year?
Now this isn't ecause I want to date other people where I move to; I'm in love with my boyfriend and would happily have him be my last. I'm worried I'm holding him back. He's a tall, clever, charismatic guy who could get another boy in a week if he wanted to but he's scared to come out and we're really happy together. 
I'm lances first boyfriend and basically his security blanket from his family at times; am I hurting him by enabling him to hide and not letting him see what dating around is like?

I'm a lurker on my main account, but this is my first post here. I could use some advice. Apologies for the long post.

I met this guy about a month ago. We had been talking off and on on Grindr for a few months, and just before Valentine's Day we decided to meet in person for the first time. We clicked almost instantly, and things were awesome.

Over the course of the next month, we moved quickly (too quickly). This is his first serious relationship. I've been in a long term relationship, but this time felt different. It felt like this guy was the one. I'm not sure how, but it did. I met his friends, we hung out a lot, and just got to know each other better. He opened up to me a bit, and I opened up a lot, something I probably shouldn't have done, but I couldn't control it. I felt like I could tell him everything, and it felt good to open up. I told him I was seriously insecure about some things, and he said that was ok. I believe (believed?) him.

Looking back on it, I may have come off as clingy/needy, which is new to me - I've never acted this way before, at least to my knowledge. I have fallen hard for this guy, and he fell for me too. We've joked about how crazy we were.

A month has gone by, and I haven't seen him in a week. Not a big deal, we're both busy. But earlier this week, he got some bad news. I asked if he wanted to hang out, and he said he wanted to be alone. I told him I understood and let him know I was there for him in any way he needed.

We texted briefly the next day, and he said he was ok. However, he stopped responding to me. I asked him a few hours later if he was doing anything later in the week, and no response. I text him the next morning wishing him a good day, and again, no response. That was the last time I tried to contact him.

I'm worried about him. I don't want to call it quits because if he's really going through some problems, I want to be there for him. But I'm also worried I might be wasting my time.

If any of you guys can be of help, I'd very much appreciate it. I'm just a wreck right now, I feel so stupid for opening up to someone only to get hurt, and I may be overthinking this, but what if I'm not?

edit: I should add that because of my insecurity, I have checked a couple of times to see if he's logged into Grindr, and he hasn't, not since we started seeing each other. I just don't know what's up and in case he never talks to me again, I might still check occasionally, and I know it's crazy but I can't help it.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey bros.

&lt;p&gt;I met this guy about a month ago. We had been talking off and on on Grindr for a few months, and just before Valentine&amp;#39;s Day we decided to meet in person for the first time. We clicked almost instantly, and things were awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the next month, we moved quickly (too quickly). This is his first serious relationship. I&amp;#39;ve been in a long term relationship, but this time felt different. It felt like this guy was the one. I&amp;#39;m not sure how, but it did. I met his friends, we hung out a lot, and just got to know each other better.

So my little brother has come out to almost all of my family, our sisters (younger) and our mother, I am not sure about my dad yet but at this point we all know BUT he does not know we all know out of respect. Its his choice when and how to do it and we don't want to make him feel anything other than support. 

That being said, I know he is saving me for last, Im the older brother, the one that has always given him lady advice (wrong tree I guess, just a joke to lighten the mood) and has had my fair share of ladies throughout the years. I am his big brother and I know I have not alway been here as I went to college and really didnt come home for about 8 years (other family issues). 

I am worried that I have no clue how to react. Of course I support him and do not care what so ever about his life in regards to sexual preference but last time someone came out to me was 10 years ago, I was in HS, and it was the most awkward and poorly timed thing he could have done. I know there is no way that would be repeated (especially here as the friend came out by asking me to come over since his mom wasnt home and he wanted to fool around, caused quite a rift between us and we went from close friends to not talking for 8+ years) but I also don't want to do anything wrong. 

For those on this thread that have come out to someone you looked up to and were nervous about (dads, big brothers, scary mothers, etc.) is there any advice you can give me to make sure I dont muff this up. I love this little dork of a brother of mine and I know he deserves the best as he has had a rough life (we adopted him after years of abuse that he still has memories of even tho he was very young).

I have since graduated from college, and am back at parents' place until I go back to school in the Fall. Now that I have become completely accepting of my sexuality I find myself craving sex with a guy. I like women more (probably 60/40) but I know I want to try actually dating a guy. Unfortunately, my parents live in a really small town. My odds of finding someone here is so very slim. 

So do I wait until I move away to the larger city my new college is in? I know by then I will be a hot penis/ass craving mess. Is there any point to me trying here? ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey gaybros, &lt;/p&gt;

I think I did a wrong thing, and need your perspective on my situation.

I live in a Russia, in the quiet town with the population about 250 thousands people. I'm 24 years old, and even though I don't have that many friends, this town is still small enough for me to regularly see familiar faces in the streets. And that's the problem, because I still keep my sexual orientation in secret. It's not that bad most of the time really, because I still like girls, so I suppose I'm bisexual. Most gays here do the same. I don't have to tell you how my country treats LGBT people.

About a month ago a guy messaged me in dating app. He was a really kind and smart person. We shared photos (almost everybody hides their real photos in dating sites and apps. You don't want to attract attention from the wrong people). We liked each others looks. The only thing that seemed to stand between us was his age. He's 18.

The one thing that every organised homophobic movement in Russia has in common is that they all link homosexuality with the pedophilia. Something links those things in minds of people. It's some kind of propaganda trick or cultural phenomenon.

We talked on the phone. He liked to talk a lot, that usually tires me quickly, but it was manageable, so I endured.

Criminal homophobic organisations like to bait guys by impersonating barely legal teens. That gives them an excuse to bully the victim. Russian LGBT propaganda law targeted at minors is not helping here, obviously. I wasn't scared of them - we talked on the phone, and on skype, and I was 100% sure that he was real.

He wanted to meet me. He asked if I was ok with him being younger than me. I was ok, we seemed like like-minded people. We met, we talked in person, we liked each other even more. Week later we were a couple.

Dating was awkward, not because we had to match our rather different schedules, and not because we had troubles with each other, but just because we had to do it secretly. People around me started noticing things. I even had to come out to my mom and sister. For some reason it didn't even seemed like a big deal. I cried one evening, but was ok the next day. I even introduced him to my sister - now that was harder.

He were pretty happy to be together. He was rather clingy, he wanted to see me every day, I didn't mind it at first, though I wasn't feeling the same. One thing bothered me now - how should I connect my old life with the new one. None of my friends know my secret, and even though they all great people, I'm not sure how they will react. I didn't want to loose those people. What would they think of me if they knew that I'm dating 18-year old guy? I wasn't sure.

Those thoughts grew stronger each day. I finally started to succumb to them. Being with him started to feel cumbersome. I've tried to put on a happy face, but he noticed that something's changed. And few days ago we've had an incident that led to our breakup.

We were sitting together at the local mall, and the group of guys sitting near noticed us. I myself do not attract much attention, I look and dress like any other guy of my age. My partner however was different. He had those feminine tones in the way he speaks and dresses. People pick on those things pretty quickly. Guys started pointing at us, then shouting something in our direction, and when we finally decided that we really should go someplace else one of them tried to follow us. I coldly talked to him on the go, and lost him at the crowd in front of the elevator.

This incident broke me. I couldn't keep at it anymore. The next day we met only briefly, and were unusually silent this time. The day after that we didn't see each other, and only sent each other a couple of messages.

Today we broke up over the chat. I will be meeting him in person tomorrow. I tried to explain myself, I tried to be honest. He called me a coward, he said that those things happen to him on regular basis, and he manages to live with them. His family does not support him either, and it breaks my heart to even think how difficult life is, and would be for him. I admitted my cowardness, I offered my unconditional support, I asked for forgiveness. I did all those things sincerely, but I don't think it worked.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi guys, I need your help.

I admitted my cowardness, I offered my unconditional support, I asked for forgiveness. I did all those things sincerely, but I don&amp;#39;t think it worked.&lt;/p&gt;

My dilemma I come to you guys with is  I think I'm ready to try anal and I really want to bot first (seems like a top should know what he is putting the bot through which is why I'd rather know before I top) and I need some advice. I found two guys who are willing to ""educate"" me and take my virginity but one has a bit of a large dick (7.5"" vs 6""). Do you think I'd prefer a smaller one first time or is it more pleasurable to go with the larger guy, etc?
