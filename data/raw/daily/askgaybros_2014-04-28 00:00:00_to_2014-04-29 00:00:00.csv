I finally admitted I am bisexual and attracted to guys about a couple of months ago. I started using jack'd since finding gay guys on college campus is hard.

I started talking to this guy, lets call him Henry. Henry says he don't like reciprocation or sex and just likes to give head/hand. I don't like sex either (just yet) but I would like to at least give him a handjob. Henry said he doesn't like being touched =(

He is a very cute guy. But I would like to at least feel him up. Should I tell him that I would like to feel him up? I am thinking that I should just respect the fact that he doesn't feel comfortable being touched but I am not sure if I will have fun (I'm new to this) if I don't get to touch him.

I am not sure why it popped into my mind but what if he is a transgender and has no penis? Or many he has stds that are visible on his penis?

And another question, if you are receiving head would you wear a condom? I am scared of catching HIV or any other STDs. 

Sorry if the questions I asked sound stupid but I am new to the gay world and very inexperienced.

A few weeks after he came out he suggested that I go out to a gay club with him, which I was fine with. I didn't end up ever going because I was busy with school and timing never worked out, but I was absolutely fine with it.

I just told him ""Come on dude, you know I'm not gay"" and he apologised and went to sleep.

I didn't see him at all for a week , until one of my female friends invited people to go to a  hookah lounge &amp; enjoy some drinks that night .  It  started off fine , as he stood next to me &amp; talked to me while we were  waiting in line . But as soon as we got in , he ignored me &amp; went to go sit next to my female friend .

When the night was over , he  finally came up to me &amp; asked if  he could stop by my house , to talk &amp; chill after everyone left . I was excited &amp; said yes . He ended up never showing up .... I'm so DONE . What's WITH THIS DUDE !? WHAT DOES HE EVEN WANT !? :/

Ex and I split up when I moved in 2012, had been together about two years. In part because he started dating BF so quickly, I cut contact with him and we've been incommunicado for a little over a year. I've moved back to town, and lines of communication are opening (we've said hi via email, may get coffee sometime down the road).

Last month (and again, more explicitly, the other day), BF messages me on grindr. Not knowing who the guy is at first, I engage. Extended convo, pics: he's looking for sex.

Couple possible scenarios: 

A. They're no longer together

B. They are together, have an open relationship/arrangement

C. The guy's just getting his kicks messaging boys online

...or, what I more strongly suspect:

D. He's cheating on my ex

I will admit to a probably-less-than-healthy interest in all of this. I might do best to stay the hell away from it all; would certainly be less complicated if I didn't know any of it. I do care about ex, and especially if we moved forward with any sort of friendliness it'd be a big chip on my shoulder.

So... what to do? Certainly won't tell ex about all this myself. Officially, it's none of my business, and it'd make things weird. Have considered disclosing this to a friend of his, someone who would know more what's going on with ex and BF and be in a better position to know what to do (also allowing me to stay clear). Have also thought of confronting BF with it, though if he's cheating he might just lie, break contact with me, and keep doing whatever he's been doing.

If I didn't give a damn about ex, I wouldn't touch this with a thirty-nine-and-a-half-foot pole. I do, though, and even though it'd be great to stick it to him (only marginally relevant, but he dumped me), would hate to see him screwed over like this.

So there are a few guy friends in my life I'm PRETTY certain are gentlemen of a certain persuasion. Now, whether or not they like men is of no concern to me. They're attractive, yeah, but I'd totally be cool with either dating OR just being friends with either of them.

Now, fast forward to this week. I'm at a party, drinking and shooting the breeze while waiting in line with a straight (?) friend for the bathroom when he goes ""dude...isn't it so dumb that girls can go to the bathroom together? We should just go. Like right now."" Long story short my friend invites me to pee with him in a single toilet. Weird? Absolutely. What's even weirder is this is the FOURTH time this has happened to me with two guy friends whom I've suspected of having a thing for the D. Is this a thing? Is this just a part of straight dude life that I've never seen before?

Im 30yrs old and has been sexually disabled for most of my 20s. After breaking up with my boyfriend when i was 23, i focused on work a lot to distract. And in the process i got addicted to porn and masturbation. I never had a sexual partner during this time. And no boyfriends either. I got fat and lonely. I was socially awkward, and i thought that i will never find someone ever again.

After 6 years of work, porn, and masturbation. I can consider myself at the top of my field. A respectable position in a company. But still fat, lonely, and addicted to porn. I decided to change everything. I started going to the gym, and after a year got really fit and buff. However, i am still addicted to porn and is afraid to meet people.

I underwent therapy with a sex therapist where i dealt most of my issues regarding sexuality. Eventually, i also heard of r/pornfree and r/nofap and it has changed my viewpoint on porn.

In the process of going through therapy, i met someone whom i really liked. We clicked and made each other laugh. And we've been seeing each othet for a year now. Sex hasnt always been great because of my 'addictions' but the connection is there. Also, we only see each other once a month, due to work reasons.

Lately, i have really been getting buff from the gym, and the attention given to me from gay men in it has been overwhelming. And eventually i have jack offed with someone i found cute. I feel that i have missed out on a lot, but im afraid i may become in too deep with these shenanigans. You can call it the Schmidt syndrome..

Quitting on porn has not helped either, since it has eacalated my horniness and need for flesh.. Something that my partner cannot be available for everyday.

So i was hoping that you could help me out with this. I dont know how 'playing' at the gym is perceived in the community. Would love to know about your thoughts. What should i do? Is this something I need to talk to with my boyfriend?

He recently got a casual girlfriend. She's a mutual friend, a great girl and they got involved on the understanding that it's a casual relationship, more a friends with benefits arrangements and they are allowed to be with other people. She's bisexual and she wanted the option of still being able to sleep with girls. 

Anyway, we were recently talking and she told me that she thinks my friend is gay or at least bisexual and in love with me. She doesn't have a problem ending their friends-with-benefits thing if he wants to be with me. He's one of my close friends and I have often picked up hints he might be interested in me.

He's does Brazilian Jujitsu and when he playfully demonstrated one of the holds on me, he got a massive boner and was very embarrassed. He's also very physically affectionate towards me when drunk. When I had bad gastric flu, he checked in on me twice a day etc and he brought me a very expensive watch for my birthday. As a thank you, I later brought him a jacket and he wears it all the time. 

But he's quite vocal about being straight. And he's so pleased to have a girlfriend at last. He mentions her in virtually every conversation.

I have feelings for him but don't know want to mess up our friendship and I don't know if I want to fall in love with someone who is still in denial/in the closet.

This is my first original post ever so bear with me:

I'd like to join a sport recreationally and for the benefits of staying in shape and meeting other people, and especially for feeling part of a team, something I have never really experienced. I'm 21 and in college, so I'm sure I could find some organization that suits me.

Two problems:

1. I have zero-- zero athletic ability. I never got into sports when I was younger and now if I'm walking along campus and a football or soccer ball comes my way I won't even throw or kick it back lest I risk a mortifying display of athletic ability. Any other guys have the same problem of getting into sports late and feeling too behind in terms of coordination? My two brothers are soccer pros and I just get into a terrible mood when I try to kick around a ball with them.

2. I'm kinda short- 5'7 (1.70m) and rather dense. You could say I have a wrestler's build, but I never got into wrestling and it's not very team-oriented. I ran cross-country and track and high school and was obviously pretty slow. I started Rowing/Crew a year ago but quickly learned it involved having longer limbs, which frustrated me because I feel like every sport requires being either big and tall, or short and light (coxswain, jockey), of which I am neither. Any suggestions of sports that might suit my body type?

For the record, I do lift a bit, so I'm not so out of shape haha.

TL;DR: Short, dense un-athletic bro wants to start a team sport? Any suggestions?

Edit: Didn't include weight which I feel is an important factor. I'm about 170 lbs (77 kg).","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my first original post ever so bear with me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d like to join a sport recreationally and for the benefits of staying in shape and meeting other people, and especially for feeling part of a team, something I have never really experienced. I&amp;#39;m 21 and in college, so I&amp;#39;m sure I could find some organization that suits me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two problems:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have zero-- zero athletic ability. I never got into sports when I was younger and now if I&amp;#39;m walking along campus and a football or soccer ball comes my way I won&amp;#39;t even throw or kick it back lest I risk a mortifying display of athletic ability. Any other guys have the same problem of getting into sports late and feeling too behind in terms of coordination? My two brothers are soccer pros and I just get into a terrible mood when I try to kick around a ball with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m kinda short- 5&amp;#39;7 (1.70m) and rather dense. You could say I have a wrestler&amp;#39;s build, but I never got into wrestling and it&amp;#39;s not very team-oriented. I ran cross-country and track and high school and was obviously pretty slow. I started Rowing/Crew a year ago but quickly learned it involved having longer limbs, which frustrated me because I feel like every sport requires being either big and tall, or short and light (coxswain, jockey), of which I am neither. Any suggestions of sports that might suit my body type?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the record, I do lift a bit, so I&amp;#39;m not so out of shape haha.&lt;/p&gt;

His Mom passed over the weekend, and regardless of this or that or the other, it transcends this bullshit and I feel I should reach out. Yes or no, and what to say?

We hang out, we hit it off, both having a really good conversation about what we're looking for and just life in general where we both are and such. Goes great, so I text him on Wednesday and the same thing happens. We hang out, nothing sexual just a little making out and some more chatting and talking and getting to know each other. So far so good.

Thursday rolls around and I text him in the morning to see if he wants to get lunch, but he says he will be getting lunch from the office but that I could come over for a cigarette break and to say hi. I do, we smoke a cig and talk, and then kiss and I leave. So far, it's going perfectly for a first week. Nothing is moving too fast and nothing seems flaky about the guy. That's when things start to change, and Friday I start to see another side of him.

Friday rolls around and he has been telling me all week that he wants to go out with his friends and asks if I want to come along finally. I say yes, and he tells me he will hit me up later that night with the details. I didn't hear from him until Saturday morning when he tells me he went out and got drunk and forgot. No biggie, kinda sucks because I ended up staying at home not doing anything because I thought I had plans with him and his group of friends.

Saturday comes and we started texting in the morning and he tells me he wants to go out that night to hang out, just us. I'm thinking GREAT and I'm really excited. Come to find, probably around 4pm that he wants to go out with his friends and apologizes, says we can hang one on one anytime but he wants me to still come out with him and his friends. He also adds that he thinks we might have rushed it a little and wants to try to hang out as friends first, but it doesn't change anything about the way he feels. Awesome. Not great news, but I am totally willing to work with that, as it's what I wanted and felt too anyways.

7pm rolls around and I text him thinking maybe he forgot. He texts me back saying he is on his way to his friend's house and that he'll let me know where we are meeting up. I don't hear back from him at all, so I send him a text. Nothing. So I wait and send him another text telling him that I'm on my way downtown to meet him and his friends and that he can text me the address. By now I have already driven downtown, waited for 45 mins in a parking lot, and left because I heard nothing from him and was wasting my time. I tried calling him a few times to make sure his phone wasn't just dead, I sent him a text every hour, trying to not be perceived as ""needy"" and keeping them brief and spaced out. Nothing. Not a word.

Finally hear from him at midnight, he sends one text saying he is sorry and that I can come to his place if I want to and see him. I'm already in bed and kinda done with the evening because this is night two he has bailed on me, but tell him we should do something tomorrow.

Sunday is here and I hear back from him that his ex was out with some of their mutual friends and he doesn't want there to be drama so he didn't text me. And he was already really drunk and his phone was in someone else's coat pocket so he didn't see my texts or calls. So I ask if he still wants to hang out today, and he says (and this is a direct quote, ""Yes absolutely! That sounds amazing :) you come come over today if you wanted"" so I tell him we should get lunch and he agrees and asks if I can come over now! I tell him I'm not ready yet, but give me a bit and I'll head there. So I get ready and then I get a text message from him telling me that he wants to smoke with a friend, so my direct response was ""You can go do that I guess. whatever"" and apparently this was the turning point. From there, he texts ""Dude I didn't mean it like that I thought you would want to join. I don't like that response man"" and I'm just stuck thinking, ""Well what about the two times this weekend I haven't heard from you and wanted to see you and hang out with your friends?"" but I don't say that, i just apologize and tell him i'm not trying to be rude I just wanted to see him and if his friends are there then that's great and I can get to know them.
That was at 10:30 this morning and I have not heard from him since. I drove to his place thinking they would be hanging out there, got there at 11, knocked on his door, called him, sent him texts, and finally I got so frustrated with the lack of communication I just left at 11:30.

Can anyone help me? I like this guy, or at least I think I do, and feel like we could easily make something work, but he clearly doesn't care about spending any time to get to know me and is becoming flaky. Or I don't know. I just need some opinions on where to go from here because none of my friends seem to know and he won't talk to me about it, and I have no gay friends to talk to about this kind of thing. I was excited because i was finally mutually interested in a guy and now I don't know what the hell is going on.
