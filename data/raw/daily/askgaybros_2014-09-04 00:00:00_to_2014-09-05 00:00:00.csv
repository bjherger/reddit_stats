I'm a recent college grad, grew up in the Seattle area, went to school in the NE, and now moving to Houston for a job. It's definitely a big change for me, but I'm excited to experience another city!

Any advice on Houston?

- What's great about the city? What's not so great? (In general and being gay)
- What are good places to live for a 20-something? I'll be working in The Woodlands and don't want too long of a commute, though I've been warned that's asking a lot.
- What are good ways to meet people? (gay or straight, friends or more)
- What do people tend to do in their free time? I'll be missing the Seattle outdoors, but think I'll live. :)

I've already been doing plenty of my own research, but wanted to see what advice GayBros would have.

Thanks!

One time at a club, he (and subsequently me as well) was kicked out of a club for starting a fight with a guy who smacked my ass while we were dancing. It wasn&amp;#39;t even a big deal to me and I didn&amp;#39;t feel uncomfortable. So we were both pretty novices at anal and I&amp;#39;ve been a bottom and he a top for a month or so, but we are still getting used to anal. Last night was the first time I ever really got used to something in my ass and was really loving it. I started moaning and, yeah, got a little porno and started saying things like &amp;quot;fuck me harder&amp;quot; and probably some otherstuff while in the moment when he just stops, pulls his dick out really hard and fast (which kind of hurt, so it took me by surprise) and he tells me that I need to stop acting like some gay slut.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IDK what to do. I do love him and like him when he&amp;#39;s not being his weird hyper masculine self, but I don&amp;#39;t want to be a puritan on top of that. I don&amp;#39;t understand why I made him mad by enjoying sex and am kind of annoyed right now. What should I say to him?&lt;/p&gt;

Ive seen it a dozen times and we both knew it was a bad idea when we started making out on a roof after day partying early in spring. We'd dabbled last year but then decided it was probably best to stick to how things were, but it got too strong to ignore or something because we were both graduating and wouldn't see each other for a long time (he left to backpack in isreal for a year). And now here I am asking reddit for coping advice because I don't have missing the one person I trusted more than anyone else. The way it ended, with him leaving without a word in June, kind of made me never want to speak to him again out of pride more than anything else because me pulling the emotional weight was kind of how we always worked and I can't do that anymore. I guess I worry that there was something else I could have done, or if and when he comes back to the states ill see him with mutual friends and punch him in the dick or something out of bottled up rage. He'll probably never take the chance to really explain what happened but I don't want to give him the chance even if he takes it. Does this kind of lack of closure ever get better?

I just feel like I need assurance that I'm not alone in this (which I know I'm not but I need to actually see someone else struggle with it as well) and that being 22 without a career is not so much of a serious problem.
