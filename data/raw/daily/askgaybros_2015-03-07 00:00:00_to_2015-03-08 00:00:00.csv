We all hang out at least a few times per week, play video games, cook food, nature trails, car events, etc. There is never any pressure when we hang out because none of us seem to give a crap about each others sexual preferences. I consider Alex and James and their SOs as really good friends these days. We've all been hanging out for a little over a year now. 

Alex has told us before that he really enjoys hanging out with us because we're not judgmental or mean, and that he really just enjoys hanging out with nice people like us. He tells us sometimes about how anxiety-ridden he can be and how awkward he can get in social situations. He hasn't seen a doctor about it yet, but he plans to, and I always assure him that he can be himself around us because we would enjoy hanging out either way. We're always sure to let people know that we are all ""good people"" and we focus on keeping a no pressure environment in our house. We've literally never had an issue hanging out and we've all been happy chilling when we do. Until last month...

One day last month, we were at my place having a few drinks. Well, a lot of drinks. James and his girlfriend end up falling asleep in their room eventually while I'm still hanging out with Alex and his girlfriend. I'm not sure where it came from, but Alex was like ""You know, I feel like I should tell you something but I'm kind of embarrassed about it. Can you keep a secret?"" And thats where it starts...

Me: You don't have to tell me anything that you don't want to.

Alex: No, I want to tell you. I feel like I should. (to his gf: Babe do you think I should tell him?)

Alex's gf: Sure, I don't care! Tell him if you want to. (very genuinely) 

Alex, to me: You know, I had no idea you were gay when we first met you. James didn't even tell me. He only told me that you're super nice and chill and love smoking green like us.

Me: Haha, yeah, most of the time its not important anyway. I love hanging out with everyone. I never really make a big deal out of being gay.

Alex: Dude, you have to keep this a secret. You can't tell anyone. Not even James. Not even in secrecy. Can you do that?

Me: Yes I can, but seriously, if you're uncomfortable, seriously, you don't have to tell me anything. 

Alex: A few years ago, my gf and I ""took a break"" from each other for a few months, and during that time, I was hanging out with [another gay friend of his.] Bro, you have to keep this a secret.

Me: I think I see where you're going, but seriously you don't have to tell me if you're uncomfortable. 

Alex: No, I want to tell you! Well, one night we were hanging out and one thing led to another and (insert awkward sex scene here.) It turns out that I really, really love anal. I love being fucked. Its like the best thing in the world. But I'm not attracted to guys.

Me: Haha thats awesome. Good thing you have such an open minded gf, I bet she can help you with that! 

Alex: Oh she does, but its not the same. I'm just really confused. I love being fucked into submission by dominant guys but I love my girlfriend and I'm also only attracted to women. 

Me: I'm sure you'll figure it out. There are a lot of people out there who won't judge you and are open minded enough to understand that. Its definitely not a big deal to me at all. But your secret is safe with me bro. 

-end

Then we changed the subject and moved on with the rest of the night, never mentioned it again. But ever since then, every time Alex comes over to visit he seems to be very nervous and anxious to be here. He mostly avoids eye contact, tries to look the other way, and hardly ever stays for too long anymore. He's like this whether he is with his gf or not. 

Something tells me that he is either embarrassed or nervous about revealing his secret that night. I guess I just want him to understand that whatever he told me does not change anything between us. I'm not suddenly going to jump his bones or anything. I'm not going to tell our friends. I don't view him any differently. I just want him to be comfortable with us like its always been. Should I bring it up to him again and explain this to him? How would you handle this situation?

So I've accepted for a while now that I'm a prude, even to the point where some of my friends comment on it (which is fine, what friends don't poke fun at each other?). However, more recently some of my friends have begun to say things like, ""Are you sure you even like guys?"" or ""I think you're asexual."" 

Now my friends aren't trying to be mean or anything (and they're being serious) but it's starting to make me think. I'm 20 (21 in a couple months) and have never had sex. I have fooled around a little bit (nothing past 2nd base) but when I have made out with guys, it's felt a little weird for me, like I just wasn't feeling it all that much, and if they ever put their hand down my pants, I'd ask them to take their hand out. A few guys have propositioned me for sex, but I've always turned them down (a few of them have been quite dashing too), and I get squeamish at the thought of having sex. I also don't care for porn because I don't like looking at genitalia or people having sex. 

The thing is though, I know VISUALLY, I'm *very* attracted to men. And when I picture myself in a relationship it's always with a man, but I rarely think about having sex with them. Is there something wrong with my libido? Has anyone else faced this and could it just be simple inexperienced virgin jitters or something deeper?

You're gonna think this is petty but here goes:


I am 24. I am a smoker. It is my one vice since quitting drinking after years of alcoholism almost two years ago. I have no intentions of quitting at this point to be quite honest. My boyfriend is not a smoker. When we were introduced, I was honest from day one because I requested we get outdoor seating at the restaurant so I can smoke while at the table. I asked him if that was a problem and he said ""I don't care"" however since we have been together he has been hounding me about how disgusting it is and how I'm such an addict blah blah blah. I explained to him that I was upfront from the get go and cigarettes were around for over a decade when we met so why would he expect me to change. It may sound dumb but it's not the fact that he hates smoking its the fact that he is trying to change me. Well yesterday he showed up at my house all upset because he lives in an old piece of crap building and his upstairs neighbors' plumbing exploded blasting a hole in his ceiling and covering his possessions in human feces. When he showed up I was excited because I have had a horrible week and was attacked at work (I work as an officer in a juvenile correctional facility) and had to taze a kid which never makes me anything but sad and I just wanted to spend my 3 day weekend alone with my phone off relaxing etc. of course I let him in and without fail he complains my house smells like an ashtray and then freaked out when I lit up a cigarette in my house and told me to go outside (it's 20 degrees out no thanks I don't pay rent to stand outside) and when I went to go pick up pizza for us to have dinner he threw out a whole carton of cigarettes and told me it ""was for my own good""..its not really a small deal because cigarettes in NYC are almost $14 per pack or $135 a carton. He fell asleep and I went in his wallet got his credit card and walked to the bodega and bought a new carton.

I'm done. I have stayed with him this long because he is attractive and intelligent but he is whiny, queeney, controlling, embarrassingly desperate for attention (he tries to be the ""funny guy"" when we are out with friends and if he was 15 it would be cool but now its sad and humiliating for me) and we have no common interests at all. I'm an Italian American corrections officer who values hard work and tries to always be up front and true to my values and myself and he is a WASP from Marin County, Northern California who moved here and works as an unpaid intern while his parents pay for everything. I want him out of my house. I'm thinking of waking him up and telling him to go but that would be low of me so I think 2moro im gonna drop him off at a hotel and wipe my hands of it.


Am I overreacting?? I have a tendency to be too serious and intense so I don't wanna do something if it was not as big as
I felt it was.  ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Made a throwaway because my main account (which I use to post on this very sub) is known to friends and possible my current boyfriend.&lt;/p&gt;

Me and my girlfriend are doing better than ever, because any insecurities have been buffed out by me building myself up with my own lifestyle and hobbies.

Lately as I begin to notice a change within my own body, I start to appreciate the aesthetics of those around me.

I see toned asses from hours of squatting. 
Smooth, hard shoulder caps complimenting veiny biceps and rock hard triceps.

Forearms that could just take me to another world.

Yep, lately I've been admiring the male aesthetic body ALOT more than usual and arguably more than the female body.

My girlfriend has done powerlifting on and off, so she's shredded as fuck; But lately, I find females... well -- boring.

They don't tend to have those shoulders I love staring at, wondering how many reps of what weight are required to attain such physique.

They have piddly arms, Their tits only get in the way of me searching for that ripped chest. The heels they wear provide only a facade for weak quads; lacking in raw power.

Power which I could find any day of the week on a construction site. 
Those boys probably don't even gym; the hard work and sweat running down their backs at 2 in the afternoon does it for them.
Every lift of the hammer, every haul from the back of the ute and every time they stir the paint; is building those tanned upper bodies we know too well. 

I wish I knew what it was like to be touched by something so powerful. To engage in a wrestling match that ended with love and smiles. To be socked in the mouth and then pulled in for a hug by a bro. 

I wish the Male physique wasn't so beautiful.
That there wasn't so many defined points to stare at.
That I didn't wish to prod and hold every bicep, knowing the rock hard resistance would make me queasy.

Most people just chuck it up to puppy love. 

The reason I ask is that I was a huge fan of the series Boy Meets World.  A character on the show named Minkus always had an unrequited love for one of the main characters named Topanga.  Now in the spin off series theyre doing, Girl Meets World, Minkus' son has unrequited love for both of the main characters who are the daughter and her best friend of the same woman(Topanga) that Minkus had a crush on when they were in school.(I know it sounds confusing but if you watch the series it would make sense lol)  

Do you think this would work between two members of the same sex?  Would it just come off as more creepy/stalkerish than adorable/enamoring? I mean its one thing to have feelings for someone who is attracted to your gender and could potentially be a mate for you.  But if youre a gay kid with an unrequited love for a straight person then thats not even in the realm of possibility.

Now in the spin off series theyre doing, Girl Meets World, Minkus&amp;#39; son has unrequited love for both of the main characters who are the daughter and her best friend of the same woman(Topanga) that Minkus had a crush on when they were in school.(I know it sounds confusing but if you watch the series it would make sense lol)  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you think this would work between two members of the same sex?  Would it just come off as more creepy/stalkerish than adorable/enamoring? I mean its one thing to have feelings for someone who is attracted to your gender and could potentially be a mate for you.  But if youre a gay kid with an unrequited love for a straight person then thats not even in the realm of possibility. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this all makes sense to someone.  I think its made more sense in my head than it does when I type it out. Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

Here's the situation I was at a New Years party where I met this really cool guy I knew he was friends with one of my friends and that I had already met him in passing once or twice but couldn't remember how, needless to say I had been drinking heavily and woke up the next morning not remembering anything about him just clearly remembering ""this really cute guy I was talked to last night"" so for a few weeks I tried everything to figure out who this mystery guy was to no avail.  Until one day, I was hanging out at my best friends apartment and he walked in, and then everything came flooding back, he's my friend from grade school's good friend from college, he is gay and is usually going out to gay bars with my friend's gay roommate.  Ever since then I became totally obsessed, couldn't stop thinking about this guy and found myself spending every other day at my friends apartment on the off chance the my crush would be there.  Now here's where I'm having trouble, I'm bi and my friend does not know yet, obviously having so many gay friends I know he wouldn't care at all but it will definitely be a huge shock to him (regardless of the friend situation I've been wanting to tell him for a while).  I reached out to one of our mutual friends who has known I'm bi and that I have a huge crush on this guy for the past few weeks to get her advice (she is still getting used to the fact that I'm bi and its clearly all very new to her).  She basically told me that I should tell my friend that I'm bi but not that I have feelings for his friend which I found totally understandable it would be a lot to drop on someone all at once.  Here's what I had a problem with, she described the whole situation as ""weird"" or ""uncomfortable"" and felt the need to clarify constantly that she doesn't have a problem with gay people but I still can't help but feel like this is only weird or uncomfortable because I want to be with a guy.  

So basically to sum it up, I need advice on how to come out to my best guy friend (in reality I know I just need to buck up and rip the band-aid off so to speak) and more importantly if I should pursue his friend with our without his blessing or should I even tell him about my feelings for his friend.

Muscular big men aren't into me, shorter thin guys are. But im obviously attracted to tops lol

I am 6'1 toned and I think im attractive but not that boy next door look. I am a lighter skin tone than all my family members I look white.

The area I live in is a suburban part of ny where everyone is predominantly italian American but it seems italians like other white dudes.
