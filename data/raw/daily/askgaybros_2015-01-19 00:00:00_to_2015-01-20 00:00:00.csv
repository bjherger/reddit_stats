I'm a bi 23 year-old guy in college. This past semester I met a fellow 19 year-old student who I befriended and became close with immediately. We share similar tastes, interests, and have the same sense of morality--pretty much everything that can make people click as friends. He also knows I'm bi and it doesn't bother him at all whatsoever. Everything's cherry.

Enter problem: He's straight (I think?). He's touchy. He's also ridiculously attractive. As in, I think he's hands-down the hottest guy on my campus. He has has a girlfriend who I'm very close to as well. I was perfectly content with just being friends in the beginning, but I think I might be developing feelings for him due to increasing physical contact between us. We both live on campus and within close proximity to each other so we always end up hanging out. I got him into Game of Thrones recently so we've been pretty much marathoning it at my place. 

Lately, whenever we're on my couch watching, he has a tendency to get close to me and put his arm around me. I usually end up resting my head on his shoulder, and then he rests his head on mine. We can sit like that for hours. If I wasn't such a horny idiot and he wasn't so hot, I'd totally be able to resist. But I can't. It also doesn't help that while we're cuddling, we tend to catch each other's eyes and hold prolonged eye contact for up to several seconds sometimes before one of us ends up cracking a smile/laughing, which is actually more perplexing than the cuddling to me. And I swear the eye contact is almost longingly. He's also much more touchy with me than our other friends. Like, if we're just standing around talking in our group, he'll always happen to end up standing next to me and leaning on me or wrapping his arm around my waist.

Aside from the cuddling and eye-gazing, even the things he says to me sometimes kind of give me mixed signals. He always jokes about how we should move to California and ""get gay married"" because we get along so well, how he should just drop his gf and we should move to another city (he's actually kind of serious with that one), just weird stuff like that in general. He also says I have pretty eyes and calls me ""the beautiful-eyed bisexual"" at times, which is pretty flattering. He tells me he loves me almost like every day, too, and says he misses me if he's not with me/hasn't seen me for like a day.

As I'm sure most of you can understand, all of this stuff (plus his SUPER HOTNESS) has led me to start developing feelings for him. I want to squash them before it gets any worse. Even if he ends up not being straight, I am way too close to his gf and respect her too much to try to make any kind of romantic advance on him while they are together. The whole situation is just really frustrating. He knows that I think he's attractive (I drunkenly told his girlfriend that one night, whoops) so he's got to understand that the things he's doing and saying might be making me start to like him, right? 

Anyway, this has been biting at me for a bit. What should I do about this? Should I talk to him about it? Distance myself from him for a while? Despite how much I enjoy the physical contact, I gotta do something about this before I end up falling head-over-heels for the guy.

One of my co-workers is an attractive, fun, ridiculous guy who just started seeing this girl. We've been pretty good friends for about half a year. Last weekend, a group of us went out after work and had a great time. We came back to my place to crash, and buddy's girlfriend fell asleep on the couch. Him and I weren't quite ready for bed, so we stayed up and talked, but this is where things got blurry. It was about normal stuff though, typical drunk life talk. I woke up the next day in my bed, and he was asleep with his girlfriend upstairs. Cool.

This weekend, we had our staff party, which was at a resort and he got a room with his girlfriend while I was staying with other coworkers. Things went to an awesome start and everyone was having a great time. I was not drinking too much because I had to drive back into work the next morning. At one point in the night, he was hilariously trying to teach us how to two-step, and we, as a dance couple,killed it. This was in front of everyone, and after he jokingly kissed me on the cheek as if he would do the same to the girl he was dancing with. He's a funny guy so everyone (including his girlfriend) was laughing and I was too, although completely dyyyyying inside haha. Fast forward an hour, we're in his room pouring drinks and as he pours a 50/50, but I grab the bottle to pour a little less stiff drink for myself. I joked about how I got too drunk last weekend and wanted to chill. He asks if I remember what happened, with a gorgeous smile on his face. I ask him what he means, and he says that I really wanted him to kiss me, so he did. At this point I just stare, and eventually find words and apologize. AWKWARD. He is so fucking charming though that he didn't seem bothered at all. He told me about how he has tons of gay friends and that he ""shouldn't knock it until he tries it"". Here we go... we start making out, and hard. Hands everywhere. His hands squeezing my back and neck. Holy shit. Being the more sober one, I broke it off. But it was SO HOT. I have no other reaction than to laugh, and he does too. We get our drinks and get back to the party, like nothing happened. I don't even know what shade of red my face was. He gets all couply with his girlfriend again like always and the party continues. I keep my mouth shut, although I giggle to myself randomly. Maybe an hour later, he asks if I want to get another drink with him from his room. Holy fuck, what is happening. We get there, close the door and just start at it again with no words exchanged. I was not even the one who initiated. Knock at the door, we stop and again go on partying like nothing happened. Hours after, it's late, party is winding down and we go to bed. End of story. 

Work with him the next day, and things are back to normal. Smiles (god, it's beautiful), jokes about the night before, showing blurry phone group selfies... I didn't hint or mention anything.

He is straight. He's had many good relationships and he tells me lots about them. How do I acknowledge this? Do I? Next time there is drinking involved when we hang out, I don't know what I will do. Of course I want to make out with him more, but I would never want to break a ""friend boundary"". But he fucking kissed me so... I feel confused. I've never been the kind of guy to let myself ""like"" a straight guy. But I have thought about this for every minute of the past few days. Such an internal struggle. On one hand, this is awesome and hell I'll make out with him any day. On the other hand, it kills me that nothing can actually happen. And through all this, I keep forgetting the fact that HE HAS A GIRLFRIEND. 

TL;DR: Made out twice with my straight friend with a girlfriend, who seems to think its hilarious and fun while drunk. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am so confused right now. &lt;/p&gt;

I'm a 31 year old gay bro, good job, believe myself to be ""likeable"" and fun to be around. I was in a long term relationship for about 6 years that started in college and ended in 2010. 

I have always been an introverted person, shy, and slow to warm up to people. If it matters, I am an INFJ. I was able to make friends in college fairly easily and met new people from them etc etc. I got into the relationship which caused drama among my friends and it caused a rift. Basically lost most of my friends and the rest moved away after college. I focused on the relationship and not on finding new friends.

Subsequently I went to grad school and focused on that. Not really developing friendships just meeting acquaintances and such. 

After the break up in 2010, my ex and I remained friends. I still feel very close to him in a sort of family way because of our history. However, he has a new boyfriend now and I feel like we have been drifting apart in other ways as well.

I have met a few people here and there. But I often feel like its always one-sided. With these people I am mostly the one starting the conversation/text convo. I am the one trying to initiate things to do. Literally I have experienced a situation with more than one person where the communication will just die off if I don't maintain it.

Honestly, I don't know what I am doing wrong and why I am having such a difficult time. Being as objective as possible, I don't think I am coming off as creepy but it's like I cant find anyone that is interested in me. I like doing a lot of things... theater/art, museums, hiking, traveling, anime, video games, trying new restaurants... 

I know this is a bit of a stream of consciousness but it is really making me depressed lately. I just wish that I could make a couple close friends.

**Relationship Background:**
I'm 22, he's 19. I've been with my bf for 1 year, it might seem like a relatively short time for some but our relationship was on the fast track.  We really clicked on a emotional and professional level, I met his parents half year into the relationship and his entire extended family when I was there during the holidays.  After 2/3rd of the relationship, I had to move across the country for a long term job.  He's tied down with school so he couldn't move.  Despite this long distance relationship, everything was fine.  We skyped for hours everyday, messaged each other every hour.  We don't rely on each other but we both understand each other very well.  I visit him every major holiday where I get 4 days off.

**His and My Background**
I came out, immediately started dating guys, settled with him after 3 months.  So very quick.  Never had a chance to fully experience single gay life.
He came out 4 years ago, dated and hooked up with a lot guys before meeting me (50+ guys).  I'm his first real relationship.

When we started dating, he was very open and would tell me about his past sexual and gay life.  I thought it was nice that he was opening up to me but at the same time I started to develop regrets on not being to experience the same thing as him.  However, I placed my relationship over my personal needs.  Told him about it, we talked and nothing happened.

He tells me he's insecure because one guy he was with cheated with him.

**Leading to Me Finding Out**
We use tinder and jack'd to meet other gay friends.  Both our profiles explicitly says looking for friends only.  He says he needs it because he wanted to have more gay friends in his life.  I need it because my job has kept me isolated from everyone except my coworkers.  My job is too demanding for me and hanging out with coworkers would stress me out more as it reminds me of work.  So I want to make new friends.

He tells me about the people he meets, I also do the same.  We're open about when we go meet these people, and how they're like.  We'd joke about us hooking up with the people we meet.  I trust him fully.  He says he trusts me but I think he lies.

I met one guy that I grab coffee with on the pretense of a hangout, just that.  Talk to him once in a while.  Becomes more of a acquaintance.  Job gets too busy, I stop trying to find new friends.

He meets a 4 other guys.  3 of them he has hung out with only once and is more of a acquaintance.  4 months ago, he meets this one guy and they click right off the bat.  They text each other daily, supposedly non-sexual.  He has showed me some of their text exchanges, but only see mostly friendly exchanges.

2 months ago, he gave me his phone and I saw that he got a text from him.  It was him saying something sexual in a somewhat joking/flirting matter.  The other guy tried to get him to clarify but my bf was being vague and changed the subject.

I casually ask him about it, he says he was just joking and changes the subject.

A few days ago I went to go hang out with a old gay friend at the bar, he flips out.

**His Confession**
3 days ago, I talked to him and explained why I feel that things are weird.  I tell him that if anything has happened he has to tell me now or it'll be worse later on.  He told me he had anal sex once with that guy right when they met 4 months ago.

**His Explanation**
He says that immediately after, they both felt it was wrong and stopped doing it.  He said he was horny then and he wasn't thinking right and made a mistake.  However, 4 months after sex, he still texts him as a friend.  Except that joking/flirting text I caught 2 months ago and him brushing my questions off about it.

He says that when they had sex, he didn't feel like he was replacing me because when we fuck, I top and he bottoms.  He topped his friend.

He was crying the whole time he told me all this.  Told me that he was never as happy as he is when he's around me.  He told me he made a very big mistake.  He doesn't want to break up.  That he'll do anything to make me feel better.  He was very remorseful.  He said he wouldn't know what to do if we break up.  He kept telling me he loved me.

**My Reaction and Thoughts**
So I am very very hurt.  I feel more jealous, insecure, and very disappointed. I trusted him completely and he's shattered it.  When we began dating he said he was past the hook ups and really hated that part of his life.  

However, I'm not as angry, vulnerable, or highly reactionary as I thought I would be.  I think this is primarily because my bf topped his friend. I always top when we fuck, so I sometimes feel bad that I can't bottom for him when he wanted to experiment once.  He says it doesn't bother him since he's a bottom.  So because he topped his friend and not bottomed for him, I feel as if he didn't replace me.  That makes me feel slightly better.

What I'm most hurt about is how long he took to tell me about this.  And how he continued to talk so much  to him as a ""friend"" throughout the 4 months after the cheating.

I explained all this.  I mentioned that I'm also hurt that he went out and did this even though he said he was over his hookup phase.  I truthfully told him that after knowing his cheating, I now feel even more regretful not getting to fully experience the hookup culture.

**Were we stand now***
He says that he'll let me hook up if I want to.  I think deep down he's not ok with this but he's saying this because he wants to do everything to ensure we don't break up.

After our chat, I told him I just needed space and said not to contact me until I text him.  I still need time to figure out my feelings.

It might sound stupid but I once imagined a married life with him.  Kids, dogs, nice house.  I can still see myself being with him after all this but essentially all my trust in him is gone.  I will almost never see him the same way as I used to.

I still have feelings for him, I still love him and want him to succeed.  I want him to be happy.  I don't want him to suffer.

I don't want to leave him because of all this.  But I'm torn because I want to experience the hookup culture I never got to experience.  At the same time I know this would hurt him even though he says it won't.  Thinking about this, I would actually be ok with a open relationship on the condition that we both are extremely open about what we do.  He said he wouldn't be ok with a open relationship.  

I know that his cheating would be a dark stain in our relationship.

I'm at a huge loss**","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry guys, know some of you might have seen too many of these posts so I&amp;#39;ll try to make it short and easy.  Any advice or help would really really help me get through this.  Thanks =)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relationship Background:&lt;/strong&gt;
I&amp;#39;m 22, he&amp;#39;s 19. I&amp;#39;ve been with my bf for 1 year, it might seem like a relatively short time for some but our relationship was on the fast track.  We really clicked on a emotional and professional level, I met his parents half year into the relationship and his entire extended family when I was there during the holidays.  After 2/3rd of the relationship, I had to move across the country for a long term job.  He&amp;#39;s tied down with school so he couldn&amp;#39;t move.  Despite this long distance relationship, everything was fine.  We skyped for hours everyday, messaged each other every hour.  We don&amp;#39;t rely on each other but we both understand each other very well.  I visit him every major holiday where I get 4 days off.&lt;/p&gt;

Relationship wise, too. The first girl I ever dated had told me she experimented in college (this was when I was 21, mind you) and the day after I told her I wasn't sure of my sexuality.

That relationship was a month. That was when I was 21. It's been seven years since I've done anything close to getting myself out there.  I let a guy from grindr blow me once,that was the only bit of ""fun"" I've had the past two years.

I have a question I'd like to pose to the community.

Let's say you're at a party and you meet someone charming, and start a conversation. As you talk more, you realize that you are deeply attracted to this person. My impulse is to try and engage them physically, 'in the moment' as it were. After all, you never *really* know if you'll ever see someone again.

However the prude in me says ""Wait a minute, if you actually want to get to know this person is it appropriate to start off a relationship this way?"" And that might be a friendship or a longterm relationship or what-have-you, but something more than just a night.

So that's my question then, how do you decide what to do? Is there some philosophy you subscribe to? Basically, am I ruining my longterm chances with someone by trying to be intimate with them on the first night? If someone approached me like this I wouldn't have a problem, but that doesn't mean it's the same for others.

On Wednesday I had something happen at work that required me to get products from a sister store bright &amp; early on Thursday morning. I called the manager (someone I've talked to before) &amp; explained the situation; he was willing to help. So I made my way over there &amp; met him for the first time. He was incredibly attractive (he sounded that way over the phone but voices can be deceiving). I had to make several trips to the store, &amp; during one of them he gave me his number; I was elated. Guys don't just give me their number! During the next trip I gave him my number &amp; we started texting during our shifts shortly after. He was just so sweet &amp; cute &amp; friendly.

Anyway, later that afternoon he asked me what I was looking for &amp; I told him I wasn't looking for hookups &amp; he agreed. Then he asked if he could call me. During this conversation he told me that he was in an open relationship with a partner he has been with for 5 years &amp; I was completely taken aback. I never expected this &amp; never thought I'd end up in this predicament. Apparently the two of them are compatible in every way other than sexually so they have a ""don't ask, don't tell"" agreement about outside relationships. I told him that I'm still a virgin &amp; plan to stay that way until I'm in a committed relationship since anal isn't something I'm really interested in. We ended up going out to dinner &amp; I had an enjoyable time (we kissed a little &amp; talked &amp; other than the elephant in the room, I felt fine &amp; enjoyed myself). Since then we've only briefly exchanged texts, which I guess I sort of expected since he has other obligations.

I guess what I'm asking is what incentive is there to be the person that isn't the main partner in an open relationship? The way it was presented to me, I would basically be someone he fooled around it &amp; went on dates with, but there couldn't be any sleepovers or anything like that because of his partner. It just feels like if I did pursue this I'd be wasting my time on a dead-end relationship. If someone can present a different perspective I'd really appreciate it.

P.S. It was so nice to feel pursued by someone who wasn't a creeper for a day so I think that's one of the reasons I'm not letting this go very easily. I also worry that maybe this isn't an open relationship &amp; he's just saying it is as an easy ""out"" to hook up with other people, because there really isn't any sort of accountability.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;ve never really understood the point of open relationships, &amp;amp; I never thought that I&amp;#39;d ever be put in a situation where I&amp;#39;d have to ask this question.&lt;/p&gt;

I need to express myself or my brain is going to stop working.

LGBTQ activits preach about acceptance and loving everyone because we all were born equal, but inside the rainbow the hate and discrimination is even worse. Dealing with homophobes is way easier than dealing with your average homo next door.

I came out thinking that being myself and being around people like me could make my life better and easier , but it's kinda the opposite.

I've done many things just to fit in and is never enough:

I work out 3 hours every day, even though before i came out i felt pretty comfortable with my body. Now getting ripped it's almost an obligation.

I even changed my music tastes and other parts about my personality in order to become more rude and masculine, because any sign of femminity is a tragedy... You know it very well.

Grindr and other dating apps just drestroyed my self-esteem,  many men don't reply to me or block me, just because i am not hot enough for them. 

It's crazy who insecure i've became since i stepped into the gay scene. 
I am just an average dude looking for someone to love, but it seems impossible in this world where i don't worth your time because my body doesn't look like those photoshopped Justin Bieber pics for Calvin Klein.

I've been rejected because i said my cock is cut and average size and 
for that reason i've been almost forced to bottoming -thing that i hate -because many think i am not 'big enough' to be a decent top.

And don't tell me that i am hanging  out with the wrong gays, because i have friends in another states and even in another countries who are dealing with loneliness because dating is a nightmare in the gay scene.

I AM SO FUCKING FED UP, i don't know what to do, my closeted life was way better than this shitty life i am stuck on today.

Now i understand those who commit suicide or join a conversion therapy group. This gay life sucks so hard.

I don't expect a solution. Just had to spit it out.

I need to express myself or my brain is going to stop working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LGBTQ activits preach about acceptance and loving everyone because we all were born equal, but inside the rainbow the hate and discrimination is even worse. Dealing with homophobes is way easier than dealing with your average homo next door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came out thinking that being myself and being around people like me could make my life better and easier , but it&amp;#39;s kinda the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;

Half of this is venting and half is me wanting to hear feedback from people who have dealt with similar situations.

In short, I am in love with my best friend, who we'll call Carl. We are both ""straight"", yet we do stuff together that it seems no other straight friends do. He recently moved to another state, and I just got back from visiting him with another friend of mine, we'll call him Jay. After the visit, my friend told me that we (the guy I love and me) have a weird relationship (thats a freakin understatement. From what  Jay saw, Carl and I wrestled every night, were constantly touching each other, etc. Jay says that it's super weird for us two, who are super close, to wrestle in bed together. By ""in bed"", I mean that Carl and I shared a bed on the visit while Jay took the couch in the living room. Each night, Carl and I would play around over who got more of the bed, the pillows, blankets, etc. I always thought it was typical guy stuff.

Anyways, back to the (actually) weird part of the relationship. For the past 5 months, Carl and I have been experimenting (?) with each other. By that I mean we started off watching porn together, then masturbating together, then mutually jerking off. Well, over the past 6 weeks of not seeing him, we both decided to take that to the next step and blow each other. That's what happened this past weekend. I got in a night early so that we could try it out, and it was fucking amazing. At first it was awkward because he picked me up from the airport and we were both nervous, but we got back to his place and started making out (another first). He got on top of me (still clothed), and we kept making out- I could definitely tell that he was into it based on the erection he kept digging into me. We undressed each other, kept making out, and got in the shower together. We showered, made out, jerked each other off while kissing, and then moved to the bedroom. We kept kissing for a while and then got into a 69 position, sucked each other off, and swallowed.

The next day on the way to pick up Jay from the airport, I brought it up to him, asked how he was feeling about it, etc. He said it was really fun, but that once was enough and that he didnt really want to do that again. I was pretty crushed, but put on a brave face and had fun the rest of the night. The next day we all hung out. Night time rolls around, Jay goes to sleep on teh couch, Carl and I start wrestling in his bed before we turn in. Im pretty wiped, so I start to go to bed, when all of a sudden I feel something wipe against my lower back. I ask him what just touched me, and he does it again. He is rubbing his penis on me and says he wants to fool around again. We make out, blow each other, and then I get on top of him and we come together on his chest. We clean up and go to bed.

The next night (my last with him), we wrestle again, this time I initiate by digging my penis into him and reaching down his pants (he's already hard). He says he doesnt really feel up to it, I say his penis says otherwise, and he says that he just wants to talk a bit. He got some bad news that day, so (naked and erect), we talk through it. He asks for a massage, so I put my legs around him and have him lean back onto my chest while I rub his back for a while. We both still have hard ons, so I start stroking him again, and we make out. He gets a fleshlight out, we lube up, and (try) to DP it together. It was sort of painful because we didnt fit, so we basically just jerked off together. He got on top of me, held our dicks together and jerked them both off at the same time. We kissed, and we came together all over me. 

Sorry for the long read, but I guess I just need some guidance. I feel like Im in a relationship with this guy, but he is so damn stubborn that he won't admit that he has gay tendencies. He's never had a girlfriend and has only had sex about 3 times with girls, he was blackout for all 3. I want something more with him- we are fucking amazing in every way together. However, I think he is under the impression that we are both just horny and looking to get off. At least in my experience, horny guys do the stuff we've been doing. Before our last experience, he asked me why I wanted to do it. I almost said that it was because I wanted to be with him, but I actually have told him about my feelings before and he acted surprised, apologized for leading me on, etc. Im worried that if I tell him again, he won't want to continue the sexual stuff and that it will weaken our friendship. At the end of the day, he's my best friend and I love him in that  way first. All things aside, our friendship is the most important thing in the world to me, and I want that to be preserved above all else. 

Is waiting it out a good call? Should I address these things with him?

Please help with a situation that happened last Friday and I sort of came to grips with it. Please bear with me for the wall of text. 

I've [25] been going out with Matt [23] for the past 2.5 years. We met while in college and while I had a boyfriend prior to going out for him, I was his first. We've gone through a lot to say the least. I was there when he came out to his parents and siblings, he was there when my grandmother passed away. Further, when his parents kicked him out I've been supporting him financially and his aspirations as comedian in the city. 

Last Friday night, I went out with some friends for general afterwork. I caught him on a date with someone. Now, you might be asking how I figured this out, here's where I went a tiny bit crazy. I went into the restaurant, I told the hostess I saw a friend, and confronted the both of them. I asked my boyfriend what was going on and asked the dude if they were on a date. No, they weren't on a date. They've been going out for a year or so and celebrating their anniversary. Matt confirmed and that's were I felt like a shock grenade went off and I was concussed or something. One of the waiters asked me if he could find me a seat and I don't really remember stepping out of a restaurant but I'm pretty sure my BF stayed in the restaurant. 

Cut to me, a cliche, as I drink my weight in whiskey sours. Asking myself what I did wrong. I come home and find everything the same. I get a call from one of Matt's siblings the next day asking to pick up his things. Today, only his sister comes and packs like a week's worth of clothes. 

I feel lost, primarily because the person I've spend almost 3 years of my life with could hide something as big as another full blown relationship without me knowing. Part of me wants to call him and ask what the fuck's going on, but my best friend tells me to cool off and not do anything rash. So dudes of the interwebs, what the hell do I do now?

I'll keep it brief.

I was talking to my Grandmom and tried to fish for her personal views on gay people. My grandparents are discreet when it comes to personal views (except that my grandad will openly run down Bush and Obama to anybody). My grandparents are judgmental and go to church, but we've been through a lot and they're important to me. 

So I asked my Grandmom how she viewed gay people, and if she'd care if any of her kids turned out to be gay. She said, ""It's not my life to live so why should I care if my kids were gay. I've had a few gay bosses in my workin days and they were really cool. Actually, my favorite boss was gay and he was always fun to be around.""

I asked another question and she said, ""If any of my kids turned out gay, I'd get over it really quickly. I mean, I can't just kick them out (of the family) and I wouldn't treat them any different or less. And [grandad] doesn't care in general. He doesn't pay attention to that kind of stuff.""

Is this a good sign that I should come out to them? I'm more afraid of what they'd think than what my mom thinks about it (who took it very hard). I'm love them a lot and I guess I'm just afraid.

&lt;p&gt;I was talking to my Grandmom and tried to fish for her personal views on gay people. My grandparents are discreet when it comes to personal views (except that my grandad will openly run down Bush and Obama to anybody). My grandparents are judgmental and go to church, but we&amp;#39;ve been through a lot and they&amp;#39;re important to me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I asked my Grandmom how she viewed gay people, and if she&amp;#39;d care if any of her kids turned out to be gay. She said, &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s not my life to live so why should I care if my kids were gay. I&amp;#39;ve had a few gay bosses in my workin days and they were really cool. Actually, my favorite boss was gay and he was always fun to be around.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked another question and she said, &amp;quot;If any of my kids turned out gay, I&amp;#39;d get over it really quickly. I mean, I can&amp;#39;t just kick them out (of the family) and I wouldn&amp;#39;t treat them any different or less. And [grandad] doesn&amp;#39;t care in general. He doesn&amp;#39;t pay attention to that kind of stuff.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this a good sign that I should come out to them? I&amp;#39;m more afraid of what they&amp;#39;d think than what my mom thinks about it (who took it very hard). I&amp;#39;m love them a lot and I guess I&amp;#39;m just afraid. &lt;/p&gt;

We were just talking, we were both kinda shy to try to aproach any physical contact but since we met online, I was pretty sure he was looking for sex (didn't make any move though).

Just before leaving, I ended up kissing him. Everything went great and now we are want to see each other again, maybe at his place again, maybe with some more time. He is more experienced than I am so for this next encounter, he seems to be really ""asking"" for sex.

I need advice because I am not sure what to do. Not only because I don't know how to start something that may end up with sex but also I don't know IF I AM OUGHT TO DO THAT! Cause the way we always chat, he is pulling these little jokes that I am his ""client"" or that I have to ""pay him for services"".

It's pretty confusing but... I did not grow any intimacy with him, cause I am not into hookups or anything. I also don't want to disapoint him, cause it seems he expects from ME the initiative. So please, any opinions will be really valuable!

Thanks in advance :)
