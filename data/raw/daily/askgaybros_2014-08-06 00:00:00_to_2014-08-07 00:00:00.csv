So tonight I messaged him asking if he was free... He told me ""I am not ready to date anyone just yet"" **AFTER 4 WEEKS OF PUTTING THIS OFF AND LEADING ME ON HE TELLS ME THIS NOW!?!**.

 I have a partial scholarship so the only thing I have to pay for is room and board. Currently at my university that is ten thousand a semester.

I've appreciated advice thats been given to other people in the past from you all so I thought this was the best place to post my feelings....

So I'm 18 years old, closeted, and from a wealthy, conservative/catholic family in PA. I feel like everything, from the way I realized I was gay, to my first gay experiences has been fucked up and I've gotten to the point where I just don't feel anything anymore. 

So I first discovered I was gay after goofing around on the internet and coming across really graphic, leather/daddy porn on google. It was hand drawn black and white shit and after I found it I kept looking at it all the time. From 7th-8th grade up I was on cam sites (Ala Chatroulette) lying about my age and doing stuff with older guys over the internet. After every time I felt so bad and a lot of the times cried because I knew it was fucked up what I was doing. As I got into high school some of that stopped, and I got more into ""normal porn"" stuff and all that. I still had this weird ""daddy/older"" thing I guess because that would sometimes come up in my searches but it wasnt super extreme which is pretty normal I think. So normal high school stuff/ crushes on certain guys/being in the closet making everything more difficult. Luckily at the time I came across as pretty straight so no one had caught onto me. Summer before 11th grade I met a really nice guy who really like me and I liked him, but I flaked out on him because of my own insecurities. He was my age, and really cute but I couldn;t handle myself and what I was feeling. So I go into the year with a crush on another guy, but neither of us was willing to make the first move so in anger I gave up. The latter half of my senior year I downloaded grindr but didn't use it. I hooked up with my first guy at a party which was awesome, and it was fun and normal. Neither of us said anything and only knew eachother from mutual friends.

 As the year went by I gave up on relationships I guess and went back on grindr. I hooked up with a guy in the same housing complex me and my friends were staying at for our ""senior week"" the morning we were leaving. He was 42 and I'm 18. It was the first guy I'd blown and immediatly afterward I felt weird because why would I hookup with a guy like that. When I got home though I kept using it. I hooked up with another slight bigger(weight wise) guy a few times and had a good time I guess. I didn't feel that weird about it, except that he was 32. With him I was actually able to talk a bit and we smoked some weed but I ended up blocking his number because i didn't want to get with him again.

After about a week on two I decided to try fucking craigslist of all places. I thought it was kinky and pervy. Just another shady thing that turned me on I guess. I decide to meet up with a guy who lived in the city and went to meet him at his apartment. He told me he was 29 and I got to his apartment and clearly he lied. He was probably mid to late 30's and had a tiny, dusty, one room apartment. He had weird collections of newspaper clippings covering his entire wall. I fucking blew im, but he didnt cum and neither did I. I realized that this was fucked up and told him I had to go. That night I went into the park outside the franklin institute and called the trevor project because I felt like dirt about my entire shady life. The lady helped me, and even though I wasnt suicidal made me realize I probably need to work on myself. 

Despite my talk with the trevor project I met up with a guy on grindr who I messaged myself this time. He was clearly was older but he was a fit, bearish guy. He was 50 and again I'm 18. The hookup relationship turned into a kind of sugar daddy thing and after a few weeks of hooking up, and going to his place to hang out  I slowly stopped talking to him. I know grindr is for hooking up and you don't need to be attached to people, but I kept thinking that I should atleast feel something from all of this stuff. From every adult hookup I had I felt more or less like a hooker on my own terms. Every night I feel like shit for getting with older guys, in really aggresively sexual situations while I'm still closeted, and turn away good happy and healthy relationships with other guys my age.

Now this brings me to tonight. I drove to an adult bookstore to but a dildo because I wanted to get better at bottoming (don't judge me please) I felt like a perv going into the store, and decided to walk upstairs and look at the porn they had. I stumbled across the screens and booths in the back area with some doors closed, and some guys standing outside. I wen't into one and started flipping through the channels. I locked the door too so no one could come in, but I heard the door slightly wiggle and realized that people cruise there. I'm 18 but for whatever reason cruising, vintage 70's/80's porn and older guys have always been turn ons for me. I've never in my life cruised (outside of grindr which is kind of differed imo) but decided to unlock the door and see if someone came in . A guy did, almost a minute or two after I unlocked it.

I feel like if I keep doing the shit I'm doing I'll end up in a bad place, and in my mind and even worse place then I'm at. 

I'm sorry this is so long, but thank you if you read this. What should I do with my fucking life?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;m really in need of some advice from some of you bros. I&amp;#39;ve appreciated advice thats been given to other people in the past from you all so I thought this was the best place to post my feelings....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;m 18 years old, closeted, and from a wealthy, conservative/catholic family in PA. I feel like everything, from the way I realized I was gay, to my first gay experiences has been fucked up and I&amp;#39;ve gotten to the point where I just don&amp;#39;t feel anything anymore. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I first discovered I was gay after goofing around on the internet and coming across really graphic, leather/daddy porn on google. It was hand drawn black and white shit and after I found it I kept looking at it all the time. From 7th-8th grade up I was on cam sites (Ala Chatroulette) lying about my age and doing stuff with older guys over the internet. After every time I felt so bad and a lot of the times cried because I knew it was fucked up what I was doing. As I got into high school some of that stopped, and I got more into &amp;quot;normal porn&amp;quot; stuff and all that. I still had this weird &amp;quot;daddy/older&amp;quot; thing I guess because that would sometimes come up in my searches but it wasnt super extreme which is pretty normal I think. So normal high school stuff/ crushes on certain guys/being in the closet making everything more difficult. Luckily at the time I came across as pretty straight so no one had caught onto me. Summer before 11th grade I met a really nice guy who really like me and I liked him, but I flaked out on him because of my own insecurities. He was my age, and really cute but I couldn;t handle myself and what I was feeling. So I go into the year with a crush on another guy, but neither of us was willing to make the first move so in anger I gave up. The latter half of my senior year I downloaded grindr but didn&amp;#39;t use it. I hooked up with my first guy at a party which was awesome, and it was fun and normal. Neither of us said anything and only knew eachother from mutual friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the year went by I gave up on relationships I guess and went back on grindr. I hooked up with a guy in the same housing complex me and my friends were staying at for our &amp;quot;senior week&amp;quot; the morning we were leaving. He was 42 and I&amp;#39;m 18. It was the first guy I&amp;#39;d blown and immediatly afterward I felt weird because why would I hookup with a guy like that. When I got home though I kept using it. I hooked up with another slight bigger(weight wise) guy a few times and had a good time I guess. I didn&amp;#39;t feel that weird about it, except that he was 32. With him I was actually able to talk a bit and we smoked some weed but I ended up blocking his number because i didn&amp;#39;t want to get with him again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After about a week on two I decided to try fucking craigslist of all places. I thought it was kinky and pervy. Just another shady thing that turned me on I guess. I decide to meet up with a guy who lived in the city and went to meet him at his apartment. He told me he was 29 and I got to his apartment and clearly he lied. He was probably mid to late 30&amp;#39;s and had a tiny, dusty, one room apartment. He had weird collections of newspaper clippings covering his entire wall. I fucking blew im, but he didnt cum and neither did I. I realized that this was fucked up and told him I had to go. That night I went into the park outside the franklin institute and called the trevor project because I felt like dirt about my entire shady life. The lady helped me, and even though I wasnt suicidal made me realize I probably need to work on myself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite my talk with the trevor project I met up with a guy on grindr who I messaged myself this time. He was clearly was older but he was a fit, bearish guy. He was 50 and again I&amp;#39;m 18. The hookup relationship turned into a kind of sugar daddy thing and after a few weeks of hooking up, and going to his place to hang out  I slowly stopped talking to him. I know grindr is for hooking up and you don&amp;#39;t need to be attached to people, but I kept thinking that I should atleast feel something from all of this stuff. From every adult hookup I had I felt more or less like a hooker on my own terms. Every night I feel like shit for getting with older guys, in really aggresively sexual situations while I&amp;#39;m still closeted, and turn away good happy and healthy relationships with other guys my age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now this brings me to tonight. I drove to an adult bookstore to but a dildo because I wanted to get better at bottoming (don&amp;#39;t judge me please) I felt like a perv going into the store, and decided to walk upstairs and look at the porn they had. I stumbled across the screens and booths in the back area with some doors closed, and some guys standing outside. I wen&amp;#39;t into one and started flipping through the channels. I locked the door too so no one could come in, but I heard the door slightly wiggle and realized that people cruise there. I&amp;#39;m 18 but for whatever reason cruising, vintage 70&amp;#39;s/80&amp;#39;s porn and older guys have always been turn ons for me. I&amp;#39;ve never in my life cruised (outside of grindr which is kind of differed imo) but decided to unlock the door and see if someone came in . A guy did, almost a minute or two after I unlocked it. Neither of used sucked eachother off but we jerked eachother off and he sucked my nipples. After I came I left the store and got in my car. THis guy was also clearly way older than me, probably mid forties. I felt like such a perv and slut for doing what I did. Cruising like that is not something people my age do and Its so messed up that in the 21st century I CHOOSE to be shady and slimy, when there are perfectly nice, happy, cute guys that actually like me.

I'm interested in a position that is offered at a company that wants to sell it's products (BI Tools) to my company. The deal is unlikely to happen though for objective reasons (and actually I'm involved largely into this decision). So I have a direct contact to he sales director of the supplier.

Last week my friend texted me really upset because this guy (we'll call him WUG) had sent him a message saying that there was a post about him on the Grindr Xtra blog and it included his nudes. He asked for details about the blog and WUG explained that Xtra guys post about other users and warn each other away from guys. My friend and I did some research but couldn't find any mention of a Grindr blog. It isn't listed as a feature of Xtra and people don't talk about it on reddit or tumblr or anywhere. I downloaded the Xtra app and started a free trial, but WUG told us it was only for the people that pay $60 for the year membership. We tried asking WUG for a picture of the blog but he wouldn't send it. We were ready to write this whole thing off when another guy (I'll call this one Military) messaged my friend and told him the same thing. This guy also wouldn't send a picture of the blog but sent my friend his own nudes. I've messed around with Military before and I messaged him again to ask for more details about the blog. Which he wouldn't give. He was more interested in fucking again.

I stopped chatting with military but he was being really insistent. I kind of blew him off and then ended up blocking him. The day after I blocked him WUG sent me a message saying someone posted about me on the blog. I got pissed, unblocked military, and confronted him about it. He basically tried to blackmail me for sex in order to see the blog. I called him out on what he was doing and he sent me a pretty long message about how ugly I was and how I was a pity fuck. WUG was offline at this moment. I had asked him for details from the blog the night before but he hadn't replied yet. Almost immediately after military sent his message, WUG got on and sent me what had been said and one of my old nudes I had sent to military forever ago. I reported military and deleted Grindr. 

Things aren't adding up. It's odd that the two guys that messaged my friend messaged me. Also, my friend didn't know either of these guys (and as far as he knew) never sent them any nudes (assuming they don't have multiple accounts). He knew which guy he had sent the pics to, but had blocked him before this all happened. I honestly don't believe the blog is real and I think we're being fucked with. I was curious if anyone knew of it was real and if they could give me advice on how to deal with this. 

Tl;dr Friend is told that his nudes were posted on a blog for Grindr Xtra users by a guy. A second guy I knew messaged him shortly after and said the same thing. I messaged guy 2 asking for details, he wouldn't send them, tried to fuck me, and was ignored then blocked by me. The day after blocking guy 2, guy 1 messages me telling me that i am on the blog.
