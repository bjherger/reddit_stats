So, I recently shaved my hairy ass (including my anus) because I wanted to be smooth for my boyfriend (plus make rimming more enjoyable for him). Now that the hair is growing back, I am suffering 24/7. The itching is unbearable and I've been noticing tiny, tiny specs of blood on the toilet paper when I'm wiping. 

Now, I know some of you will talk me into keeping my hairy ass as it is, but I don't want to. So, should I let the hair grow back and suffer until I get it waxed when I see my boyfriend again (in a month) or should I go wax it ASAP? Money is kind of an issue as I'm a student in a foreign country and I have no source of income, so if I get it waxed now, I hope it's going to last until August. 

How do you guys take care of your ass hair? ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys, &lt;/p&gt;

Everyone was right, all my friends, aunt, cousin, the guys on this sub. I was accepted, and even though it was awkward, my mum hugged me and began to tear up and told me she loved me no matter what and always will. I almost cried as well. And my dad said a few good words too, that they've always said it didn't matter if I was into men or not. It was far more anti-climatic in real life than in my head and I could visually see them processing it because honestly I think they had no idea from the reaction. My mum went to bed early so yeah I understand the need to take everything in. My only mistake was doing it before we ate, I guess I felt the need to push myself instead of waiting for the right moment and never finding it. I certainly feel better being open now.

Typical story i guess - new bf..been about 1.5 months.

I've put off sex so far as we appear to both be tops. I wont lie, i have no interest in being a btm. I don't enjoy the risk (prep wise), the stress affects my enjoyment and well - personality/enjoyment wise ... i'll always be a 95% top!

Is this a red flag to part ways? He's the same as me, never tried it - doesn't want to ... I'm not going to push him, but i'm not going to cave. We get on ok ... but i'm limited in the relationship because he's so damn emotional he'll hurt himself if i break up with him :/

I guess I had thought to just leave it - deal with it for a few months ... if he caves awesome, if not - he'll probably cheat and at least I have an excuse to go for a guy who clicks with me sexually (without him being all emotional and threatening to off himself again) ergh. Probably reads up weird - but yeah

TL;DR - don't appear to click sexually ... he makes me happy personality wise but I cant really go elsewhere because he's so emotionally unstable - any suggestions beyond a) waiting for him to cave or b) waiting for him to cheat so I can leave him without feeling guilty of he tries to threaten me emotionally?

I tried to massage my prostate for the first time yesterday, and I'm still not sure if I succeeded or if I failed. I was never able to stick in more than half an inch of my finger, until yesterday. I used my entire finger (I used water as lube, since I don't have actual lube because I'm a 16 year old virgin) and it went really well. It didn't hurt as much as I thought it would, and it actually felt pretty nice. Honestly, it barely hurt at all. 

I have one slight problem, though. I think there's something wrong with my arsehole. Sorry, I need to use these bad words to explain the problem. Anyway, I used my finger to massage my prostate but I can't tell if it's my prostate or if it's something else.. How is it supposed to feel? 

When I stuck my finger in there, I felt like a wall blocked my passageway and when I tickled it, it felt really good. I then bent my finger and massaged something else and it felt even better than massaging the ''wall''. Is there supposed to be a ''wall'' in your arsehole? Or is there something wrong with mine? I'm concerned. If no one understands what I mean, then I might be able to draw a picture or something. 

And my second problem is that it felt like poop was running down my ass after I was done. I checked, and there was nothing there. Is it supposed to feel like you're crapping your pants? Even after you're done?

Have you ever found yourself liking someone a lot, but you don't know why you like him -that- much? And I mean this beyond mere physical attraction.



Using an example to better illustrate what I mean: Enter hypothetical GuyX. GuyX is handsome enough (i.e. not drop dead gorgeous), nice, well-mannered, and we share a few things in common like knowing about the same obscure geek references or studying the same subjects in school. There is mutual interest, and we genuinely have a good time when we're together. But as time goes and we get to know each other better, it's clear our differences are greater than our similarities. Differences in values, life goals, communication habits, even the way we treat each other and other people. I'm just listing what's important for me to have in a partner. On one hand I'm apprehensive and know it should end, on the other hand I'm just 'I like this guy soo much!' So when it inevitably ends, the latter thought remains, which I internalize as there being problems with me as a person (I now know not to do that anymore). I usually hold the 1 or 2 really good things in the relationship to justify all the other not-so-good things and then beat myself up for it.



So, I'm still a gaybie and my dating history isn't long at all, but I've gotten myself in this scenario more than once and I feel like I fall for guys like GuyX, while turning away those who DO fit closer to my 'ideal partner image' (usually rejecting them on the basis of really superficial qualities...) It wasn't like GuyX was one-of-a-kind either, though at the time I thought he was. **I should make another important point** - GuyX is usually Caucasian, comes from a comfortable middle-class family, from a small city/town, certainly privileged. I'm not Caucasian, come from a working class family but have had the fortune to live and study abroad and am very good at blending in with those crowds.



I have some ideas regarding culture, upbringing, status, etc, but maybe you guys with more experience, especially in interracial relationships, could shed some light and help me work through these thoughts. One of my worries is that I'll keep (quoting from Robyn) letting the bad ones in and letting the good ones go... thanks -

I've been with my boyfriend for almost 11 months now. The first 8 or 9 months were great, but recently we've had some struggles. What it seems to boil down to is we both can sense that things aren't the way they were. Before, we were nearly inseparable. Now, the excitement isn't what it used to be. 

Over the course of the relationship, things have changed too. I started a full-time job, he joined a sports team at school and made a new group of friends.

We've talked to each other and been open about our feelings. We acknowledged that we've reached the point in our relationship which requires some adjustment and work, but we also still want to stay committed.

My question is, how can I/we reignite that spark which was omnipresent in the relationship in the beginning months? How do I tap into that excitement that drove our relationship forward?

Thanks bros. I'm all ears!
