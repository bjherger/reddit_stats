I'm a 30 year old bloke from Australia, pretty normal. Some recent events lead to me telling my family and closest friends that I was gay about 3 weeks ago. It went really well, know one was too fussed. My mates didn't care and nothing has really changed.

I'm outwardly pretty straight, the only thing really that my close friends mentioned had made them consider it was a possibility was that I never really invested too much in making relationships (with girls) work. And personally I finally decided that I wasn't going to make some poor girls life miserable by faking a love for her that I realised I was never going to feel.

I've never been with a guy. Not too rushed to change too much about my life either, just happy that I don't have to lie to the people that I love any more.

Ok so what was my question... Oh right, I have no idea what to do next. No gay friends, no... (hope this isn't the wrong thing to say) interest in girly / overtly gay blokes as potential partners. I'm your pretty typically 'straight' guy, I like sport, my house is a mess haha I work out and like to be strong but don't care too much about my personal apearance other than that. I don't have a lot of interest in (what im hoping is) stereotypical gay culture.

How the fuck do I meet people like me? Am i the minority of the minorities? Or is this subreddit for guys like me? I'm not to keen on dating apps (if im honest its because at the back of my mind I'm nervous about what kind of guys it will present me with and I'm kinda horified about people I know, uhhh seeing me on them?)

I don't know, guess I'm just confused about what happens now... Thanks for listening to the semi-rant.

PS. Love the community of /gaybros it was a nice find.

I'm in love with one of my best friends (I'll call him John). He knows that I like guys even though I have never specifically told him (most of my other friends already know). I've known him for a few years. I've always had a suspicion that he might be into guys / into me, even though he's consistently been hooking up with / dating girls since the first time I met him. Currently, he's dating a girl (I'll call her Ann) that I have been friends with for the last 4 years. However, Ann treats John like absolute shit.

Also, John comes from a very conservative family and I could easily see him being super uncomfortable with the idea of liking guys.

About two weeks ago, I was hanging out with Ann and we were both talking about John.  Ann was saying shitty things about John so I tried defending him.  After a while, Ann came to the conclusion that I am ""in love with John"" and as a result, got kind of pissed off at me and went to bed (She's known for a while that I like guys...She might be jealous??).  

A few nights later, I ran into John and ended up hanging out with him all night.  At first, I was very scared that Ann had been telling him that I was in love with him, so I felt slightly nervous.  After a while, me and John got really drunk and I quickly wasn't as nervous as I had previously been.  Tonight was an unusual night for the two of us because Ann is usually clinging by John's side. As a result, I very rarely hang out with John by myself.  Tonight however, they had gotten into a fight and Ann went to bed early.

After a while, we both got very drunk and I accidentally told John that I loved him and that I wanted to apologize if there was anything that Ann was saying about me that made him uncomfortable.  He said that he had already known that I really liked him and that he didn't care.  I couldn't tell if he thought that I loved him in a joking / friendly way or in a serious way.  Regardless, he spent the remainder of the night telling me that he loved me too and telling me that he didn't like dating Ann and that he has wanted to break up with her for a little while.. (They currently live together in the same apartment and are kind of stuck living together until their lease is up)  He also kissed me on the cheek 2 times over the course of the night.  We went to a bar and were constantly playing with each other's hair and were constantly touching / wrapping our arms around each other's shoulders. We were hanging out with a few of our other friends but ended up leaving the bar together and held hands for a little bit on the walk towards our houses.  John abruptly told me that he had to go home to see Ann and left me.  Before he left, he mentioned one more time that he didn't really like Ann that much.

My big question...Does John like me?...Do I have any chance at ever being able to be with him?...Do I do anything? or just see how things play out?...This has been consuming all of my mental energy for a long long time.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will be a bit of a long story.

I always think logically before I let my heart follow, but my heart won this internal fight, and of course, I end up getting hurt.

I'm going to attempt to keep this as short as I can. About 2 weeks ago, I met this guy on Scruff. Older guy, he's 45, I'm 24. There was something about him that made me message him. And he wrote me back almost right away. we had a lot in common and a few days later we met up at his place. We ended up naked, just cuddling for an hour, nothing else really happened. I was in complete bliss. Being in his arms, I felt a joy, complete happiness, that I literally cannot even describe. It was something I knew I was missing in my life, and I knew in that moment, I needed it.

I'm one of those people who strongly believes in vibes and spiritual connections. Whatever it was, me and this guy had it. All of last week, I could not get him out of my head. I kept messaging all week, but as he told me when we got together, he just started a new job. So he's been really busy with his new job. 

All I wanted to do is see this  man, even for 5 minutes. Just to see him and even say hello. It would literally make my week. It's been tough getting responses from him all week. I sent good morning texts, good night texts, phone calls, but seldom were returned. I try him as I'm on my way home from work, and got through. We chatted a bit, and he invited me over again tonight to his place. He told me he was delivering something to a friend's place, so he would get back to me around 8:30 pm.

I know it may have been crazy, but tonight was going to be the night I told him I felt. I know I have only known this man for 2 weeks. But I have never felt emotions this strong for another human being. I was going to tell him how happy he made me feel, how I felt when I was with him, How all my fears, worries and insecurities all vanished and in that moment in time, it was just me and him...and I was even going to take a chance and see if he would consider being my boyfriend (would be my 2nd real relationship in my life, first actual boyfriend) ... I felt so nervous, yet so happy.

Around 8:20 pm, I went to a store near his place, since I had to go there anyways to pick up some stuff. I was out by 8:45 pm. So I got in my car and waited for him to call me letting me know he was ready for. 

Fast forward, it's 9:40 pm and I haven't heard anything. At this point, yes, I began to cry in my car. I felt so heartbroken, so betrayed. I had a lump in my throat, my stomach was in knots and I felt like I was going to throw up. 

I went back home, and just basically cried the whole way home. When I got home, I had to put on a mask for my family. (I'm not out, so I can't exactly go home and talk about my problems) I come to find that I didn't do a good job. Everybody was asking me what was wrong, and why my eyes were so watery. I blamed it on my contacts and just locked myself in my room....and well here I am writing this post. 

It's 11:15 now, and I have yet to hear from this guy. 

I have so SO many insecurities. My self esteem is lower than gum stuck to the ground. Because of that, I don't ever open myself to emotions like this. I identify as loner...because exactly for reasons like this. And not hearing from this guy AT all, just brought back all those insecurities. It just hurts so much knowing that there was someone I was willing to give a piece of my heart to, just burned me so bad. And the crazy thing is he probably has no idea how much he hurt me. 

Like I said, I have never EVER felt this way about anyone, and becuase of my insecurities, my mind goes to the worst place and I'm convinced that this guy doesn't care about me, he doesn't give a shit how I feel. It's honestly 100% possible that it was something stupid that he never got back to me, like he fell asleep, he stayed at his friend's place...etc. But again because of the way I am, I'm just trying to prepare myself for the worst...

I honestly don't know what I want to hear, I don't know if it's advice, reassurance, tips.... I just needed someone to vent to since I have no where to go with this. I feel like such an idiot for thinking this guy could be the one, and telling myself to keep waiting and keep waiting. I just don't know what to do... and my insecurities are on full blast right now...as tears just fall into my keyboard.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This...may sound crazy and absurd....even I am judging myself for all of this, because I know better than this. I always think logically before I let my heart follow, but my heart won this internal fight, and of course, I end up getting hurt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to attempt to keep this as short as I can. About 2 weeks ago, I met this guy on Scruff. Older guy, he&amp;#39;s 45, I&amp;#39;m 24. There was something about him that made me message him. And he wrote me back almost right away. we had a lot in common and a few days later we met up at his place. We ended up naked, just cuddling for an hour, nothing else really happened. I was in complete bliss. Being in his arms, I felt a joy, complete happiness, that I literally cannot even describe. It was something I knew I was missing in my life, and I knew in that moment, I needed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m one of those people who strongly believes in vibes and spiritual connections. Whatever it was, me and this guy had it. All of last week, I could not get him out of my head. I kept messaging all week, but as he told me when we got together, he just started a new job. So he&amp;#39;s been really busy with his new job. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I wanted to do is see this  man, even for 5 minutes. Just to see him and even say hello. It would literally make my week. It&amp;#39;s been tough getting responses from him all week. I sent good morning texts, good night texts, phone calls, but seldom were returned. I try him as I&amp;#39;m on my way home from work, and got through. We chatted a bit, and he invited me over again tonight to his place. He told me he was delivering something to a friend&amp;#39;s place, so he would get back to me around 8:30 pm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know it may have been crazy, but tonight was going to be the night I told him I felt. I know I have only known this man for 2 weeks. But I have never felt emotions this strong for another human being. I was going to tell him how happy he made me feel, how I felt when I was with him, How all my fears, worries and insecurities all vanished and in that moment in time, it was just me and him...and I was even going to take a chance and see if he would consider being my boyfriend (would be my 2nd real relationship in my life, first actual boyfriend) ... I felt so nervous, yet so happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around 8:20 pm, I went to a store near his place, since I had to go there anyways to pick up some stuff. I was out by 8:45 pm. So I got in my car and waited for him to call me letting me know he was ready for. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward, it&amp;#39;s 9:40 pm and I haven&amp;#39;t heard anything. At this point, yes, I began to cry in my car. I felt so heartbroken, so betrayed. I had a lump in my throat, my stomach was in knots and I felt like I was going to throw up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went back home, and just basically cried the whole way home. When I got home, I had to put on a mask for my family. (I&amp;#39;m not out, so I can&amp;#39;t exactly go home and talk about my problems) I come to find that I didn&amp;#39;t do a good job. Everybody was asking me what was wrong, and why my eyes were so watery. I blamed it on my contacts and just locked myself in my room....and well here I am writing this post. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s 11:15 now, and I have yet to hear from this guy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have so SO many insecurities. My self esteem is lower than gum stuck to the ground. Because of that, I don&amp;#39;t ever open myself to emotions like this. I identify as loner...because exactly for reasons like this. And not hearing from this guy AT all, just brought back all those insecurities. It just hurts so much knowing that there was someone I was willing to give a piece of my heart to, just burned me so bad. And the crazy thing is he probably has no idea how much he hurt me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I said, I have never EVER felt this way about anyone, and becuase of my insecurities, my mind goes to the worst place and I&amp;#39;m convinced that this guy doesn&amp;#39;t care about me, he doesn&amp;#39;t give a shit how I feel.

As a precursor, I'm 18 5'6, and Asian while he is 5'10 White, and we met online through various means that I will not disclose right now, but eventually we had a long distance relationship with each other. However even though it was long distance with hardships and such, we we're able to figure it out and still be happy. He's in college and I'm a senior in highschool and he only lives 2 hours away from me and we we're each other's first relationship and first a lot of things and we've met three times and gone on a date. However recently, i mean 24 hours ago he told me that he's changed and it's been dreadful.

 I've always been in a long trusting relationship with this guy and recently, I've actually been completely happy and hopeful for our future together and actually though he was the one and I thought he thought the same. However yesterday he told me one thing which shocked me, he told me that he didn't feel right being with me because he didn't feel attracted to guys anymore, that anything sexy I did wasn't turning him on. He told me he wasn't gay anymore and it just destroyed me because it was so sudden. I can't move on because his reasoning is so abrupt and so hard to understand. He said that he loved seeing my face but he felt it as a friend. The problem with me hearing this is that I know that since sixth grade he's been looking up and have been obsessed and liked guys. He's also a lot more introverted than me and hasn't really told anyone about him other than his best friend. It was only a month ago he was linking me things that really got him excited and turned on. It felt so sudden and rash and I just can't understand it and I have way too many questions on my head. I asked him if he liked girls and his ""mhmm"" didn't even sound genuine, and when I asked him if he liked guys all he said was ""I don't know"" and that he's ""changed""

 As another story because I also understand this point of view of the argument, his family is very religious and he is as well and he thought that it was a sin to like another guy. That eventually led to our first almost break up, but neither of us were happy and the next day we got back together because we were both happy when we were together. So there is the argument that he is suppressing his emotions in that terms, but it just feels devastating.
What happened now? Well, at first we called each other last night and talked about it and it was just a bundled mess of crying and him saying ""I'm sorry"" the entire time. Another part of it is that he wants to become friends, he still wants to talk to me or be a very close friend to me, which is very hurtful and bad so I tried telling him I couldn't talk to him anymore and that just destroyed him and made him cry too much as well and so on. I've just been completely depressed because of what happened and I kept asking him if he could see a future without having me talk to him and all he can say is that it'll be hard and lonely but he'll try. I told him to tell me to break up with me last night and he did but neither of us were still emotionally stable

 Now we go to today, through help of another guy who I can trust and gives me advice, (he's older around 27) he tried to suggest to me to try and do a break with him so he could take time off me to thing and re-evaluate. I don't think I have much luck, but it's the first glimmer of hope that I can at least keep, and if he does feel the same way after our break, at least I'll have better closure than right now. I asked my guy if he would be fine with that, at first he said he didn't want to hurt me and that he wanted me to be free (all of these were accompanied by teary eyed emoticons) but eventually agreed to it, because it was the first thing today that made me smile even a little bit.

I asked my guy if he would be fine with that, at first he said he didn&amp;#39;t want to hurt me and that he wanted me to be free (all of these were accompanied by teary eyed emoticons) but eventually agreed to it, because it was the first thing today that made me smile even a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just needed some help and I don&amp;#39;t know where to go, sorry for the long read&lt;/p&gt;

I'm a closeted bi guy, and was working my way towards coming out. I now see that a lot of my fraternity brothers are openly homophobic, which is hindering my plans to be open. I'm looking for support, to hear similar experiences, and to hear some ideas as to how to try and improve my situation (without dropping out of the fraternity).

**Intro:**

I'm at a private university in the middle of a conservative/country area. I'm a closeted bi guy, and have made it this far just dating girls. I haven't made any gay friends yet, for the simple fact that I have never met a gay guy in person before. I've recently tried meeting guys on dating sites/apps, but most guys are either only looking for sex or far too old (I would want to date other college-aged guys). Because this area is conservative and rural, most of the guys I actually click with are discrete/closeted and are unwilling to go on dates. I am beginning to realize what a total drag it is to be in the closet, and feel like this is helping me move towards coming out some time this year.

Last year, I joined a fraternity. **I truly believe that doing so has changed me for the better, as many of our core principals promote things like academic success, public service, responsibility, and self confidence.** There are also many benefits I receive from being active, including:

* **Professional:** Resume building, professional connections, leadership and philanthropy experience

* **Social:** Easier to meet girls and appease that part of my sexuality. (hard to meet girls in class, engineering major, 1 girl for every 20-25 guys)

* **Financial:** Since we have paid off our mortgage and actually *own* our house, we can set fees cheaper. Staying in the dorms at my private university costs about $7,000 for an academic year. I pay just over $3,000 (saving close to $4,000) a year to be an active member and live in house. I also have the option to living here over the summer if I want to take summer classes, which the dorms do not offer.

**Actual Issue:** 

We are currently in the process of giving out bids for this semester. One of our prospective members is openly gay (and... very stereotypical/flamboyant). I had no idea that so many of my brothers were homophobic until we started discussing giving him a bid several weeks ago. I would say 1/3rd of the house is against it, 1/3rd is hesitant to accept him (no experience knowing gay people, or other, actually valid reasons), and the remaining third is either fully accepting or withholding their opinion.

Some of the things that were being said include:

* ""If he was just gay idk if I would have a problem, but this guy is a fagg*t. I don't want a brother that would rather watch Sex and the City than play sports with us.""

* ""I've been hit on by gay guys before, and it has made me feel very uncomfortable. I don't any of us to be in that situation.""

* ""I'd only be okay with it if he pulls mad bitches and can bring a lot of girls over to the house for the rest of us.""

At this point I think my brothers are just worried that this guy doesn't have anything going for him besides being gay. I understand where some of them are coming from; I do not like stereotypical gay men romantically, since many of them act too much like women. That being said, I don't think I would have a problem being friends with one as long as some of our interests lined up... but I have never met one before so idk.

Since this has been an issue on everyone's mind this semester, I'm actually starting to notice it outside of just fraternity meetings. At a restaurant a few weeks ago, we had a pretty obviously gay waiter. He made some joke at one of my brother's expense, but it was all in good fun and we all laughed. Once the waiter went back to the kitchen, the brother said *""I bet he wouldn't have said that if he knew how much I hated homosexuals""*. And even last week (can't remember exact context) my best friend said *""Idk man, I just don't like gay people.""* We've apparently only had one openly gay member in the last 6 years (he graduated before I joined). He was our chapter president for a year, so I'm trying to believe no one really cares *that* much about homosexuality... but that was a completely different group of guys back then.

I have just been feeling so shitty lately because of all of this. I'm starting to doubt my decision to join. Most of the guys that were accepting don't live in the house, so I only see them once/twice a week. Most of the guys that I live with and see on a daily basis are the ones openly opposed to it. I have started to withdraw, preferring to hang out in my room alone than do group activities. I feel like I can only be half of myself (the part that likes girls) and it's beginning to take its toll.

**Last Comments:**

The answer to my problem isn't as simple as dropping the fraternity. As I mentioned before there are benefits, and at this point the benefits still outweigh this negative... but it's a pretty big negative that is impacting other aspects of my life. Recall that I mentioned being in the closet is an annoyance, and the turmoil I experience on a daily basis trying to hide myself is exhausting. Something that I can't help but wonder is this: ""What if by coming out, I can help other discrete/closeted brothers realize it's okay to be different?"" 

I'm really wishing there was at least one brother/friend who could relate to what I'm going through. I would still like to come out, but now that I know what I am dealing with in my brotherhood, I am not sure how or when to do so. I'm looking for support, similar stories, or ideas from you guys as to how I can improve my situation.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt; Last year, I joined a fraternity and have really enjoyed it.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If he was just gay idk if I would have a problem, but this guy is a fagg*t. I don&amp;#39;t want a brother that would rather watch Sex and the City than play sports with us.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve been hit on by gay guys before, and it has made me feel very uncomfortable. I don&amp;#39;t any of us to be in that situation.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;d only be okay with it if he pulls mad bitches and can bring a lot of girls over to the house for the rest of us.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I think my brothers are just worried that this guy doesn&amp;#39;t have anything going for him besides being gay. I understand where some of them are coming from; I do not like stereotypical gay men romantically, since many of them act too much like women. That being said, I don&amp;#39;t think I would have a problem being friends with one as long as some of our interests lined up... but I have never met one before so idk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since this has been an issue on everyone&amp;#39;s mind this semester, I&amp;#39;m actually starting to notice it outside of just fraternity meetings. At a restaurant a few weeks ago, we had a pretty obviously gay waiter. He made some joke at one of my brother&amp;#39;s expense, but it was all in good fun and we all laughed. Once the waiter went back to the kitchen, the brother said &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I bet he wouldn&amp;#39;t have said that if he knew how much I hated homosexuals&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;. And even last week (can&amp;#39;t remember exact context) my best friend said &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Idk man, I just don&amp;#39;t like gay people.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; We&amp;#39;ve apparently only had one openly gay member in the last 6 years (he graduated before I joined). He was our chapter president for a year, so I&amp;#39;m trying to believe no one really cares &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; much about homosexuality... but that was a completely different group of guys back then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have just been feeling so shitty lately because of all of this. I&amp;#39;m starting to doubt my decision to join. Most of the guys that were accepting don&amp;#39;t live in the house, so I only see them once/twice a week. Most of the guys that I live with and see on a daily basis are the ones openly opposed to it. I have started to withdraw, preferring to hang out in my room alone than do group activities. I feel like I can only be half of myself (the part that likes girls) and it&amp;#39;s beginning to take its toll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Last Comments:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer to my problem isn&amp;#39;t as simple as dropping the fraternity. As I mentioned before there are benefits, and at this point the benefits still outweigh this negative... but it&amp;#39;s a pretty big negative that is impacting other aspects of my life. Recall that I mentioned being in the closet is an annoyance, and the turmoil I experience on a daily basis trying to hide myself is exhausting. Something that I can&amp;#39;t help but wonder is this: &amp;quot;What if by coming out, I can help other discrete/closeted brothers realize it&amp;#39;s okay to be different?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m really wishing there was at least one brother/friend who could relate to what I&amp;#39;m going through. I would still like to come out, but now that I know what I am dealing with in my brotherhood, I am not sure how or when to do so. I&amp;#39;m looking for support, similar stories, or ideas from you guys as to how I can improve my situation.&lt;/p&gt;

We were engaged, had the wedding planned, etc.  Regardless, the relationship had some pretty major issues, such as her trying to change me, her being angry with me all the time, me being selfish, etc.  Thankfully, I ended the relationship about 6 months before the wedding, and I'm incredibly happy I made that decision.

Fast forward to now, I accidentally fell in love with my best friend (always knew I was bi but never acted on it), and we are in a relationship and living together.  Our relationship is perfect, we plan to spend our lives together, and I have zero doubts in my mind that we will make it work.

One side of me is incredibly excited to tell my friends, I want to be able to share my joy and excitement with my relationship with everyone.  The other side of me is nervous that people will think I ended my previous relationship because of my sexuality, which is only a small reason compared to the other major flaws in our relationship.  

My fear is that my ex-fiancé will use my coming out as leverage to make me look like the bad guy to our mutual friends.  ""He knew he was gay, he cheated on me with his friend, etc"", which isn't true but based on the timing and circumstances, a very convincing argument could be made.  I also don't want the impression to be had that my 5 year relationship was a lie because it wasn't and a lot of good memories are still there.

Any and all perspectives and experiences are welcome.  I Feel extremely ready to come out, just have a few more fears I need to conquer.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I dated a girl five years.
