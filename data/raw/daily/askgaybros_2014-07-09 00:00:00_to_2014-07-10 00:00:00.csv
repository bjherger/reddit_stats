Background - Im a 27 year old british pakistani gay dude, with a fairly moderate family,

The story so far :

* I come out to my family in October 2013, after meeting my Husband earlier that year

* They tell me they still love me even though im gay (Gee, thanks guys)

* Go off to pick my husband up in America, i get a message from two of my oldest sisters, telling me 

"" even though we love you, we cant accept you're gay, so please dont bring your husband to family events and dinners, because we cant accept it yet""

* I understandably get mad at this, because you know, they're supposed to be my family and accept me regardless, and this hurts. Growing up my family placed high value on unity and sticking together.

Now, i have a niece who im a father figure to, and i love like my own child.. I lived with my sister (her mother) for three years, and helped raise her. The thing is, I would like to keep up good relations with her just for the sake of my niece, but where do i start when my sister refuses to accept me being gay, my husband, and practically ignores half of my life?

When i go see my sister, she has made it clear she doesn't want my husband coming along, which makes me feel terrible about it because i don't want my husband to miss out, nor do i want to disappear from my nieces life.

How do i handle this? do i continue going to see my niece and ignore the mother ( She hasn't stopped me from seeing her yet) ? I feel if i continue to go see my niece without my husband i feel bad because i hes missing out, but i also feel insulted because they refuse to accept something about myself i cant change?

Forget all the usual difficulties that come with dating like finding someone who's interest is mutual and who you're compatible with in terms of interests and life goals. As of now those are taking a back seat as I'm more interested in finding someone (or the key to finding someone) who isn't battling severe mental illness. 

I know this might seem ironic given my screen name but I'm really not looking to be my partners therapist and yet everyone I have met within the last six months (as well as my partner who I was with over a year before that) has had some kind of issue involving mental health. I wish I were exaggerating but I'm not. 

For whatever reason I tend to meet men who have some form of autism (typically aspergers) or borderline personality disorder or things of that nature. Many of them have been extremely sensitive to any perceived slight and narcissistic to the point where I begin to wonder how they have anyone in their life at all. People close to me (mainly other mental health workers) tell me this happens because they're drawn to people who will listen and who they feel may be supportive/sympathetic towards their issues (whether real or imagined.)

Yet I have no desire to be with someone who is disturbingly narcissistic or lacking in basic social functions. I have nothing against anyone suffering from mental illness and am more than happy to work with people like this on a professional level but I cannot handle it in my private life as well. 

I know I'm not alone in continuously meeting men like this either as I've seen other posts in the past where things like this are discussed. I also know gay men have a higher rate of mental illness due to a myriad of issues that surround us because of our sexuality and how it's handled in society but surely there must be people out there who are healthy or healthier than those who keep appearing in my life. 

Any suggestions/thoughts? ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone here know what it is? Forget all the usual difficulties that come with dating like finding someone who&amp;#39;s interest is mutual and who you&amp;#39;re compatible with in terms of interests and life goals. As of now those are taking a back seat as I&amp;#39;m more interested in finding someone (or the key to finding someone) who isn&amp;#39;t battling severe mental illness. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this might seem ironic given my screen name but I&amp;#39;m really not looking to be my partners therapist and yet everyone I have met within the last six months (as well as my partner who I was with over a year before that) has had some kind of issue involving mental health. I wish I were exaggerating but I&amp;#39;m not. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For whatever reason I tend to meet men who have some form of autism (typically aspergers) or borderline personality disorder or things of that nature. Many of them have been extremely sensitive to any perceived slight and narcissistic to the point where I begin to wonder how they have anyone in their life at all. People close to me (mainly other mental health workers) tell me this happens because they&amp;#39;re drawn to people who will listen and who they feel may be supportive/sympathetic towards their issues (whether real or imagined.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet I have no desire to be with someone who is disturbingly narcissistic or lacking in basic social functions. I have nothing against anyone suffering from mental illness and am more than happy to work with people like this on a professional level but I cannot handle it in my private life as well. &lt;/p&gt;

I'm 19 and live at home with my parents and sister (17) in the UK. My family is Agnostic and I'm Atheist. She has a new boyfriend, a guy her age she's known for a while. He's good looking, but there is no attraction whatsoever.

Earlier today I went up to their room and asked them about something irrelevant (this was my second time meeting the guy) and I joked that he looked like he needed a hug (he wasn't sad or anything, just sat by himself). So I went over, he stood up and we hugged for about 10 seconds. I then joked that this was too long, and that I was sorry but he was bi to my sister. They laughed and I left.

Later, when my mother returned from work she was told of this by my sister and said I was a weirdo in a jokey manner. After the evening meal when I was helping her clean up she talked to me asking why I did it. I said why not (feeling incredulous), not understanding the need for a reason to hug someone. She went on about how it was not normal for two guys to hug (after challenging this she modified her position to not normal unless gay partners) and said that it was embarrassing to her and ""the family"", and that while I lived in her house I lived by her rules, getting quite annoyed and refusing any further discussion on the topic.

She also said to ask any of my friends on Facebook or Twitter if two guys who aren't gay hugging is normal, confident that they would think it wasn't. So, channelling my inner anarchist I'm asking askgaybros instead.

What do you think? Am I missing some societal rule and embarrassing my family? Or is my mother just being close-minded?
