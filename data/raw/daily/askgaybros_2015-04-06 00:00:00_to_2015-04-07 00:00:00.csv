I got really upset because I tried calling him and he wasn't picking up his phone on purpose. 

In the morning he blew up at me saying ""I've avoided relationships because of that phrase and the long pause"" - this was after I told him I needed to talk to him about some things. I understand how sensitive that phrase can be, and after fixing some miscommunication he said that it brought him back to some annoying and bad memories. We cleared things up and it wasn't personal. 

The guy I'm dating is not very good at being 100% responsive over text and it bugs me. He kinda selects what he wants to respond to. He's going through a rough weekend with some family stuff and his brothers are staying at his place, and I guess I should be understanding, but I feel like I'm cutting him too much slack because he's not being very clear with me. Thing is he's sending me pictures of his bowl and I know he's just high a lot of the time. I know it wouldn't hurt to just talk to me, and I feel if he really cared why wouldn't he pick up the phone?

So I got mad and told him to pick up his damn phone. I told him that his lack of response is bothering me and how I felt that I've been asking too much about going out with him, which is true as I feel like 70-80% of the time. I'm hard on myself and always give him the benefit of the doubt.

Afterwards, he said he was sorry he treats me like shit. Those words didn't sound very sincere to me and it felt like he was pushing me away. I tried to salvage it, hoping that he wouldn't say something about not wanting to see me anymore.

I hate forcing to communicate over text with someone that I like, and I can't just show up at his place. We had a few words here and there about some irrelevant stuff, but I don't really know where we stand. I feel like I need to understand what happened in his past relationships to understand how he is. I just don't feel like he is giving me his 100% and we've been seeing each other for almost 5 months.

I recently ended a 3 year relationship, hes 27 and I'm 23. We lived together and everything. It was going wonderfully, but then we hit a rough patch, we hadn't had sex in 4 months, we were both very stressed, and he ended up moving out, we stopped talking for two weeks and then he came to get his stuff and we decided it just wasn't working and to end it. Fast forward another week of not talking, I begin to deeply miss him and realize that I have been too harsh on him. I have a bit of OCD where if things aren't perfect I get incredibly stressed and mad. Anyways so I message him, and we are on good terms talking like mature adults, he comes over and we talk about our relationship and where things went wrong, but he says things like ""I really think its for the best though for both of us"" and towards the end of the conversation we both end up kind of confused, but he says he will message me sometime in the weekend.

Well its saturday and his message never comes, I am bored and lonely and decide to go to the local gay bar alone, I met someone, we hit it off, and went back to my place and fooled around. In the morning I immediately regret the decision, I send the guy home and tell him I don't want anything to do with him because I'm not over my ex. The realization that I may have just brought finality to my relationship sank in, that now, since I have slept with someone else, we can't talk things through anymore and we can't ever go back. I was quite uncertain about the relationship, and I am young and wasn't sure I was ready to be serious without ever trying topping/rimming (ex bf didnt like that) and that is what I did with the guy from the bar, and I ended up not liking it so much, but I felt it was something I had to explore. 

Needless to say, I discovered the grass is not greener on the other side, but in crossing the side I feel as though I burned the bridge behind me. 


My ex messaged me today, and we are going to talk more in the near future. I can't bring myself to tell him what I did because I know it will crush him, and I know that he would never be able to get over it. I can't bring myself to lie to him either, I can't live out a relationship on the basis of a lie. While we are 100% broken up, not even on a break, and this happened, I don't feel like my actions are completely justified. I acted out of desperation (did not want to be lonely), horniness (no sex in 4 months), I wanted to cover my pain and forget my ex, I was thinking ""the best way to get over someone is to get under someone else"" and I didn't realize how stupid or wrong that is until afterwards. 

This guy gave me 3 wonderful years, he's the most incredibly smart, handsome and faithful guy, and we have so much in common. I'm afraid if this doesn't work out I will never find anyone I like as much as him. He really was the perfect guy for me and we probably could have worked things out but I think I burned that bridge. Out of how much I love my ex, I can't let him find out. I don't feel like I have to tell him if we aren't getting back together, so I think the only thing to do is to make sure we don't get back together. I would do anything to avoid hurting him so bad. I cannot be so mean to someone so innocent that I love so much. The thing is it is killing me knowing we can't be together anymore, and that it is all my fault.

A meeting comes up for my boyfriend. He's involved around campus, so I figure it's just something there. I ask what's the meeting for, but he tells me not to worry. I ask why he can't tell me, but he said the same thing again. Some meetings are confidential and school related. We're together for a bit as he works on a presentation for class later. I ask again, but he says the same thing. 

About 20 minutes later, he finishes and tells me to come with him. He said he was going to cancel the meeting so we could have lunch. I think it's weird, since it seemed important, and now he's canceling it. However, I can't anymore because while we waited a friend who I was going to meet later said she could see me sooner.

So, we go to his meeting site. It's the school's clinic, and again he says not to worry and goes in. I kind of freak out in my mind and assume the worst, that perhaps he has some kind of STI/STD. I text him, but he doesn't reply until much later and tells me he'll tell me all about it when he sees me, but he's in a good mood and he was being cute about it too.

Turns out the meeting, was a counselor/psychiatrist meeting. A while back he was over worked and got an asthma attack and the nurse asked him to come back to check up on him. I said he should have told me that, than having gone through all that worry. What he said next irked me, though. He said I have to accept the fact that I don't need to know everything.

As his boyfriend, I think I should get an honest answer if I ask for something but I also believe he's entitled to his own being. A psychiatrist visit isn't the first thing I'd talk about to him either. His words seem harsh and kind of a power play, I think, but I also think I should trust him more. 

So, what do you all make of this? Who's right, who's wrong? How do we meet each other halfway? ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re both 20, and have been in a relationship for 2 years.&lt;/p&gt;

I ask why he can&amp;#39;t tell me, but he said the same thing again. Some meetings are confidential and school related. We&amp;#39;re together for a bit as he works on a presentation for class later. I ask again, but he says the same thing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 20 minutes later, he finishes and tells me to come with him. He said he was going to cancel the meeting so we could have lunch. I think it&amp;#39;s weird, since it seemed important, and now he&amp;#39;s canceling it. However, I can&amp;#39;t anymore because while we waited a friend who I was going to meet later said she could see me sooner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we go to his meeting site. It&amp;#39;s the school&amp;#39;s clinic, and again he says not to worry and goes in. I kind of freak out in my mind and assume the worst, that perhaps he has some kind of STI/STD. I text him, but he doesn&amp;#39;t reply until much later and tells me he&amp;#39;ll tell me all about it when he sees me, but he&amp;#39;s in a good mood and he was being cute about it too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out the meeting, was a counselor/psychiatrist meeting. A while back he was over worked and got an asthma attack and the nurse asked him to come back to check up on him. I said he should have told me that, than having gone through all that worry. What he said next irked me, though. He said I have to accept the fact that I don&amp;#39;t need to know everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As his boyfriend, I think I should get an honest answer if I ask for something but I also believe he&amp;#39;s entitled to his own being. A psychiatrist visit isn&amp;#39;t the first thing I&amp;#39;d talk about to him either. His words seem harsh and kind of a power play, I think, but I also think I should trust him more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what do you all make of this? Who&amp;#39;s right, who&amp;#39;s wrong? How do we meet each other halfway? &lt;/p&gt;

I'm not really looking for best or worst experience, just the strangest or most unexpected. My personal example:

A very close friend of mine, who I'll call J (and who I just came out to 3 days ago), has been trying to get me to date for over a year now. He says some variation of how I need to meet a girl, and *always* adds ""or guy"" to the end. He got married a couple of weeks ago, and at the reception he told my best friend that he hoped I'd meet a nice girl or guy that night. Afterward, my best friend (who I was already out to) basically said I had no good excuse not to tell J -- clearly he's already suspicious and doesn't care, right?

A few days ago, J, some friends of ours and I all made plans to go to a bar. A few hours before we met up, J asked if I could give him a ride back home since his wife planned to leave early. I said yes, knowing it was a golden opportunity to come out to him in private; I promised myself I'd tell him that night come hell or high water.

Later at the bar, J makes a comment about how nobody's 0% gay, and that he's probably about 30% gay himself. (Keep in mind he's never indicated that he's not completely straight, and he's saying this two weeks after getting married.) Right after making that comment, he turns to me and says ""*Right neofreakx2? Everybody's at least a little gay.*"" I'm floored. I was already convinced he thinks I'm gay, and now he just called me out on it. I stammer out some awkward response about how that's basically what the Kinsey scale is for, and the conversation moves on.

We leave, I drive him home, and as I slow down to let him out, I stare down at the steering wheel and say ""Hey...so...obviously you've been hinting at it...so...yeah...I'm gay."" I rehearsed earlier that day, but I blanked and it came out really awkwardly like that. After I finish telling him, I turn back to look at him, and he's got a look of total confusion on his face. He says ""That's *not* what I was hinting at, but...whatever."" He says it's no big deal, and we make plans to work on a project over the weekend.

I go home and sleep, but I spend half the next day unable to make things add up. Finally I text him and ask first why he looked so surprised, and second what he meant about the 30% gay comment if it wasn't directed at me. Turns out every time he added ""or guy"", it was meant as a joke -- he didn't have the slightest suspicion. And the 30% comment was a joke too. He's totally straight, and it was purely coincidental that in the years we've been friends, the only time I've ever heard him joke about being gay was on the night I planned to come out to him. Three days later I still can't get over how low those odds must be.

I'm only out to a half-dozen friends, but if I've learned anything by now it's that coming out is completely unpredictable. So, anyone else have a good story about their coming out not going as expected?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This question is exactly what it sounds like.

&lt;p&gt;A very close friend of mine, who I&amp;#39;ll call J (and who I just came out to 3 days ago), has been trying to get me to date for over a year now. He says some variation of how I need to meet a girl, and &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; adds &amp;quot;or guy&amp;quot; to the end. He got married a couple of weeks ago, and at the reception he told my best friend that he hoped I&amp;#39;d meet a nice girl or guy that night. Afterward, my best friend (who I was already out to) basically said I had no good excuse not to tell J -- clearly he&amp;#39;s already suspicious and doesn&amp;#39;t care, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, J, some friends of ours and I all made plans to go to a bar. A few hours before we met up, J asked if I could give him a ride back home since his wife planned to leave early. I said yes, knowing it was a golden opportunity to come out to him in private; I promised myself I&amp;#39;d tell him that night come hell or high water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later at the bar, J makes a comment about how nobody&amp;#39;s 0% gay, and that he&amp;#39;s probably about 30% gay himself. (Keep in mind he&amp;#39;s never indicated that he&amp;#39;s not completely straight, and he&amp;#39;s saying this two weeks after getting married.) Right after making that comment, he turns to me and says &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Right neofreakx2? Everybody&amp;#39;s at least a little gay.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;m floored. I was already convinced he thinks I&amp;#39;m gay, and now he just called me out on it. I stammer out some awkward response about how that&amp;#39;s basically what the Kinsey scale is for, and the conversation moves on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We leave, I drive him home, and as I slow down to let him out, I stare down at the steering wheel and say &amp;quot;Hey...so...obviously you&amp;#39;ve been hinting at it...so...yeah...I&amp;#39;m gay.&amp;quot; I rehearsed earlier that day, but I blanked and it came out really awkwardly like that. After I finish telling him, I turn back to look at him, and he&amp;#39;s got a look of total confusion on his face. He says &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; what I was hinting at, but...whatever.&amp;quot; He says it&amp;#39;s no big deal, and we make plans to work on a project over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I go home and sleep, but I spend half the next day unable to make things add up. Finally I text him and ask first why he looked so surprised, and second what he meant about the 30% gay comment if it wasn&amp;#39;t directed at me. Turns out every time he added &amp;quot;or guy&amp;quot;, it was meant as a joke -- he didn&amp;#39;t have the slightest suspicion. And the 30% comment was a joke too. He&amp;#39;s totally straight, and it was purely coincidental that in the years we&amp;#39;ve been friends, the only time I&amp;#39;ve ever heard him joke about being gay was on the night I planned to come out to him. Three days later I still can&amp;#39;t get over how low those odds must be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m only out to a half-dozen friends, but if I&amp;#39;ve learned anything by now it&amp;#39;s that coming out is completely unpredictable. So, anyone else have a good story about their coming out not going as expected?&lt;/p&gt;

I was horny and not thinking straight. We exchanged pics and we both thought the other was really hot - so he asked me to come over. I obliged -- I grabbed two condoms (oh the irony) and some lube and headed over. I was the one bottoming. I asked him to use a condom from the beginning and *watched him put it on*, so I thought I was in the clear. But at some point during the process, he removed it and I didn't notice until almost the very end. I expressed my concern (""Uhh, that makes me pretty nervous, you can't just use the condom?"") and he said he couldn't cum with one on, and that he was 100% clean and tested. At the very least, I asked him to finish outside of me, which he kinda did. But when I got home and started cleaning up, I noticed 2 horrifying things: 

1. He actually did cum in me a little bit and did not pull out early enough

2. The sex was so rough that there were tiny little droplets of blood on the tissue paper when I wiped.

So I messaged him back on Grindr and said ""Hey, are you absolutely sure you're clean? That made me really nervous back there."" and he replied the same way ""Yeah bro, 100% clean. I just got tested when I broke up with my bf a few months ago, and I don't do this very much.""

So now I'm contemplating going to the ER and asking for PEP. I feel like my life isn't in my own hands anymore and I can't know about my status for at least 3 more months. I have no idea if I can trust that this guy knows his status or if he's just some stupid bro who's never been tested and feeding me bullshit.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So today I met some guy on Grindr.

&lt;p&gt;If you could let me know your opinion or your previous similar experiences (I hope?) as I&amp;#39;d really appreciate some help in analysing it as I&amp;#39;m seeing someone at the moment and I&amp;#39;ve started to feel this petty negative way and I&amp;#39;m worried that I&amp;#39;m not sure if I&amp;#39;m self-sabotaging or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance&lt;/p&gt;

I have also developed this weird illness. Well not weird but annoying. Just being tired more than usual, chills from time to time, mild headache. It just appears out of nowhere during the day and goes away. It might be unrelated and might be due to all the stress I've had.

So I ended up with external warts. I have hemorrhoids internally so she said I could have them internally but those just kinda do their own thing. I was told I could wait and see if they go away on their own or get them cut off. I have read all these stories of horrible pain from having them removed and I hope they just go away. But for those who had surgery, did you get the internal and external removed? My doc told me to just get the external ones removed if I do because the internal surgery could cause major problems and since HPV is so common and ""not that big of a deal"", the complications of getting the internal removed aren't worth it.

So my questions are: if you had them, why happened? They just go away or had to get surgery? And did you get the internal, external, or both removed?

Did you have a fever and everything too and did it last a while or did that go away?

Also......what do I do? I have them on my anus but I RARELY bottom so the whole no bottoming thing won't be a big deal.
