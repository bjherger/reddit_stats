Well am openly minded and dont have a problem with gay people, i secretly have some of them as friends at school because my parents will freak out if they got to know i have gays as friends ( they say ,gays are bad influential company)....well,i mostly go through my bro phone now and then because he mostly updates his phone with entertaining medias and apps.

So i went through his phone and saw an app named hornet,so i got curious as to what the app could be for......i tried opening it but was password locked,so i gave up.I then came across another app named scruff,i tried opening that too but was also password locked.....so i decided to google it out later to know its function because my bro always keeps interesting stuffs on his phone and if those apps are on his phone,then they are interesting.......but i forgot to search them out.

So onetime in school,one of my gay friends had an app opened on his phone......i saw lots of profiles with pics of guys,then my friend told me it was a gay chat app......i felt intrigued,took his phone and tried to analyse the app.I scrolled through profiles and then i came across a profile with a pic of my bro ( huh!),i entered into the profile and saw more pics and profile descriptions which left me speechless.......i then asked my friend of the name of the app and he told me"" hornet"" ( ooh so this was the locked app)

So am guessing my bro is gay and might be having a hard time keeping it away from us(family) and being happy.I really understand him if he doesnt want our parent to know about it,atleast for now.  I love him and want to support him to make him feel at ease with me,so he can be himself and talk about anything around me ( atleast,if he knew i accept him and love him for whatever he is....he will feel kinda relieved)

But i dont know if i should tell him, i already know about him and i dont care and accept him or i should wait till he comes out himself, which will probably not be anytime soon considering the families religious morals....

well i kinda had a chat with him about marriage and family and am guessing he wants to follow the norms of the society( by getting straightly married)  .i guess he wants to do that so not to disappoint our parent and their believes.....but i now know that isnt the life he really wants and he could be unhappy .........can i help in someway?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So my bro and i are from a very strict christian home with insane beliefs and values.Our parent aint that much homophobic but their comments and views of homosexual isnt the best too,they view it as a bad thing and that it kinda a choice with no benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

So a little background, I'm a 22 year old college (engineering) student with a penchant for men older than myself. So much so, that it's extremely difficult for me to imagine myself dating anyone under about the age of 30. The physical attraction is completely lacking. I hid my sexuality for so long that everyone my age just seems like a good friend candidate, and I wouldn't say I'm attracted to any of them. 

I think it's partially the body type that I prefer (bigger, beardy, hairy guys, bears), and the sense of elevated masculinity that comes with these traits. Oh and I LOVE gray and white hair. One of the first pictures I ever masturbated to was a picture of Santa on a newspaper. 



OK so, for the past four months I've been seeing a 61 year old man. He's got a great beard and a deliciously furry body, and is a total bottom. It's basically everything I've dreamed of, better than any porn I've ever seen. 

I know it's not very wise to build a life with someone who has much less time left on earth than you, but I'm not necessarily worried about that at this point in time. He is very healthy and visits the gym 5 days a week, and hasn't been sick in years. 

I've been finding it hard not to think about him ALL the time. In class? His face pops into my mind. In bed? All I can think of is grabbing his furry body and kissing his bearded lips. 



I'm just wondering what your opinions on this might be? What would you say if you saw a 22 year old kiss or hold hands with an obviously much older man on the street?

I have no idea how my parents would react. They're very liberal and I've got a gay uncle (who was married to a man 15 years older) AND a gay brother. I haven't told them yet for fear that they'll be disappointed because they won't be getting any grand children. Oops. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys, &lt;/p&gt;

I'm 19, bi/gay idk yet tbh. Anyway I met this guy online and we have been talking for the last two months on and off and it looks like we will finally be meeting up soon (he says his never been with a guy before and from what he has told me and stuff I have found out I actually get the impression he's a virgin. He seems very unsure of himself and his emotions towards men, he constantly stops talking to me and then will message me again, he's in his early 20's btw), I know I can do better but it's hard because I don't find myself attracted to a lot of guys and he really is, physically at least someone i'm really attracted to.

Anyway even if we never meet I am just asking this for future reference so any help would be appreciated:)

1. Tips on giving bj's, is it better my mouth is dry beforehand or moist? I heard you shouldn't brush your teeth or have mints like an hour before because it cuts your mouth during head, is that true? Do you start with the foreskin and then move your way down? Is it better to go slow or really fast?

2. Should I make him wear a condom if i'm giving head. If neither of us have cuts is it safe? Can you get HIV/Aids from head?

3. If this would be the first time I have been analed what are ways to prepare myself? My friend got analed and apparently her bf ""slipped"" and she started bleeding heavily and had to go the emergency room. What are ways to avoid this?

4. Is it normal to feel like you need to go to the toilet during anal, if so what do you do when this happens? Even more important if you have been analed and everything goes fine does it hurt going to the toilet the first time after. Should I wait a few hours or even a day till I go? Does it hurt to pass?

5. Should an ass be completely shaved before anal?

6. Is there any real stimulation from nipple play?

okay to start of I'm 19. haven't done anything with a guy. but recently me and this guy has been talking. and i can see him and I in a relationship. but however I'm in the closet because of a crazy family who would probably right me off if they found out i was gay. 

so my first question is. When/how should I tell him I'm still in the closet.

now on to my second question and statement. we have been talking via online. we meet on tinder, i think he's VERY cute but I'm not sure how he feels about me, since this is like my very first rodeo with a guy, he calls me babe is that a thing everyone does, or am I right in assuming that hes showing some kind of attraction or affection?

this is my second(?) question. since we've been talking online and through text. where is the best place to meet up at? what would you prefer if you where in his shoes?

and my final question/statement. I've only got one in the sack, and I feel kinda very insecure about that. it definitely shows, and just looks off. if me and him (or any other guy) were to do anything sexual, how should i tell him? should i tell him right now? should i tell him right we we start to do anything sexual? if you're a single nut bro, how do you handle this situation?

I've never lived anywhere else outside of home and a month ago I decided to just say fuck it and move out to New Mexico!  
  
This was a freakin giant step and for the first few weeks it felt awesome! I loved it and the people and I finally felt free, but now I'm starting to feel depressed and alone. I sometimes come home from work, lock my room door and just hide under my blanket or play video games.    

I've only ever been in one relationship before and it was more so for convenience because I was running away from home and rather than be homeless I went to live with an older guy for two years and it was beyond horrible after the first few months, so I don't know how to date or even initiate a friendship with anyone.     

Guys online will try to talk to me but after the initial what's up and hi, I'm at a loss for words and don't know what to say or do. I really only hooked up at home and I don't wanna do that anymore now that I've left all that behind.   

I've had one best friend or rather friend period my entire life and he's really the only person I talk to, but he's several hundred miles away now and he has girl things to worry about. I don't even remember how to make friends because highschool/middle school was how I met my Best friend.    

Anyway, I need some help, is there anyway someone can give me some advice on how to talk to guys or be less awkward when I people try to talk to me online or in person. I try to act like the happy-go lucky type at work but anywhere else i just shy away and freak out when people try to talk to me.

&lt;p&gt;Guys online will try to talk to me but after the initial what&amp;#39;s up and hi, I&amp;#39;m at a loss for words and don&amp;#39;t know what to say or do. I really only hooked up at home and I don&amp;#39;t wanna do that anymore now that I&amp;#39;ve left all that behind.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had one best friend or rather friend period my entire life and he&amp;#39;s really the only person I talk to, but he&amp;#39;s several hundred miles away now and he has girl things to worry about. I don&amp;#39;t even remember how to make friends because highschool/middle school was how I met my Best friend.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I need some help, is there anyway someone can give me some advice on how to talk to guys or be less awkward when I people try to talk to me online or in person. I try to act like the happy-go lucky type at work but anywhere else i just shy away and freak out when people try to talk to me.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR: sheltered life has led me to be socially awkward and I need help being less awkward. &lt;/p&gt;

I love this subreddit and the advice that is given, so I figured I would use it as my outlet for now as I am too scared to bring this up to anyone else for fear they will think I am batshit insane. I apologize for this being likely way longer than anyone would like to read but I can't help word vomiting right now.

At what I feel is the old (in relationship terms) age of 25, in the last 6 months or so I have taken some risks and found myself reaping the rewards I guess you could say. I left a job I devoted myself to for nearly 9 years after the realization that my skill set could be applied to much more. I now have what I am 100% sure I can call as my dream job and am loving every minute of it. I have been more open about myself at work and feel I don't have to hide being gay from anyone--in fact there are a lot of other LGBT people I work with and our work environment is super inclusive and never judging. Everything has been super great until meeting *him*.

When he first got hired here, I didn't pay him any mind. I actually felt judgmental for a moment, internally wondering how he managed to get hired here and questioned his capabilities and knowledge at the job. I'm not sure if you bros have ever had a moment that just someone just **clicked** for you, but it happened to me one day where I noticed his hair, his amazing eyes and the fact that he is in great shape. I also noticed his kindness and how he was very much an unapologetic and easy going person.

Where this became more than just your average crush is that most people at my work suspect he is gay, but he has never explicitly said yes or no. He doesn't mention a girlfriend, and his mannerisms have lead many people to making that suggestion. With me in particular, our relationship has evolved into one where we are able to have awesome work related conversations but includes a lot of flirting and touching that he doesn't do with anyone else. At one point a coworker I rarely work with commented out of the blue that there was some crazy sexual tension between us which made us both turn really red and quiet.

I remember reading a post here where someone brought up the term [Limerence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limerence) and being a Psych major in school it made me feel like when you read about a theory and it fits you perfectly, which is a little unnerving. I don't think there's a day that I don't think about him, and what's annoying is that my emotional feelings tend to manifest in physical ways. I get this weird lightness in my body when I start romantically fantasizing about him and severe chest pains when thinking about the possibility of rejection. I've had plenty of crushes (especially straight crushes) and none of those have felt like this does.

Now this is understating my feelings I think but for brevity's sake I will spare you the countless paragraphs I could write. My question is what do I do now? I know the obvious option is to disclose my feelings and take a risk that he may or may not feel the same way, or even be interested in guys at all, but in this weird sadistic way I wonder if I would feel happier in this state of limbo, just not knowing but still being able to have the idealizations of him that I do now. I guess my question to this subreddit is how do I make myself push past the fear of rejection into that scary area where things have the potential to be much better and much worse?

There are definitely highs of daydreaming of stuff we would do as a couple, being able to cuddle with him, etc. However, there are definitely lows of me telling him how I feel and him ostracizing me from my coworkers, actively hating me and not wanting to talk to me anymore, and me drifting back into heavy depression and feeling bipolar like with suicidal thoughts. 

If anything I'd be glad to hear I'm not batshit crazy and that there are other people who have experienced things like this and how you overcame these feelings. I feel like right now I am near having a panic attack and emotional breakdown because I am nearing my breaking point. Also virtual hugs always count for something :)

TL;DR: So happy with where my life is, meet amazing guy who I don't pay attention to at first, then now is the object of my desires. Feeling completely attached and can't stop thinking about him. How do I either ignore these feelings or overcome them?

I've come to you all today to complain. I'm really going to be a whiny bitch for the next few paragraphs so buckle up for some really grating self-loathing.

I'm not well endowed. My dick is small. I'm one of the accursed. It's not a micropenis, but it could pass for one when it's soft. My flaccid penis is an inch or two depending on the temperature and no wider than my thumb. It does grow when it gets hard. 5 inches or so. I swear I measured six once when I was really excited. Maybe a little thicker than the diameter of a quarter.

It's the absolute most embarrassing thing when a guy tries to fondle me through my pants and can't find it. It's happened a few times and I just freeze. His hand wanders and he gets confused, I just want to be anywhere else in the world in that moment. I think to myself that maybe I should tell him I'm a FTM so at least I have an excuse and just get out of there. But I just have to sit there and live with it as he discovers that I'm woefully unhung.

One guy actually started to play with it, sighed, and asked me to just blow him and leave. I can't say I blamed him, despite the rude display. I know that someday I'll find someone who loves me, he's not going to care that my cock could pass for half a raw chicken wing. But I'm young, guys like to hook up. I like to hook up. I want a fuck buddy. I don't want to see and feel that disappointment when they discover my little fella.

There's nothing I can do to change it. I shouldn't be ashamed. It's not my fault, it's out of my control. The universe put such an incredible amount of effort to make my existence happen, and I'm frustrated by my tiny pecker. It's such a small (pun intended) problem comparatively, but facing this grim reality day in and day out wears on you.

I wish for one day I could just swing a monster between my legs and feel like I could live up to the expectations (or hopes) that other guys have when getting into bed together.

End rant. Thanks for reading.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello, Bros.&lt;/p&gt;

Both of us are 19 year old males in college. My boyfriend and I have recently revealed to one another that we are in love. Our relationship is happy and healthy except for one part: sex.

My boyfriend isn't fond of sex. In fact, he says he doesn't like porn or the idea of anal. He doesn't like the sight of a penis. I realize that sex is more than anal. However, I can count on one hand how many blowjobs I've received. The answer is a disappointing 4. Moreover, we've only had anal intercourse once. He didn't seem to despise it either despite him telling me that he thinks it is gross.

Recently, we had a long chat about our relationship to understand where we were and where we wanted to go. I made it apparent to him that the only thing about our relationship that I was concerned with was our lack of physical intimacy. He revealed to me (after I had asked him) that he jerks me off so quickly only so we can go back to cuddling. Cuddling to him is the ultimate form of physical intimacy and he said that when we cuddle, that is when I am the most sexually attractive to him. However, he also said that he thinks of giving me a hand job as a chore. Merely something that he has to get done. After he said that, I felt horrible. I internalized it a different way than he said it. To me it sounded like ""Being with you is a chore because you want to do those things."" He said that I should have told him about this, but I did. Or at least I tried without blatantly saying, ""I want a blowjob/anal."" I have said that ""We should try the humping thing again"" and he blew it off and said ""Ew, no."" I've hinted at blowjobs by making it known to him that I REALLY like them.

If it were up to him, he would like sex, which to him would just be a hand job, 3 times a month. I would like sex 3 times a week. This wouldn't be that big of an issue if it wasn't for the fact that getting a hand job that lasts for five minutes is all that I'm getting. He said that all I have to do is ask, but after he said he thinks it's a chore and that he likes to get it over as quick as possible, it feels like asking and him saying ""Sure"" would be a lie. As if he is doing it just to appease me. While I can appreciate his attempt to compromise, that doesn't change the fact that I would always be aware that he is uninterested and waiting for me to be done.

TL;DR: My boyfriend thinks sex with me is a chore and doesn't care if we do it even though I would like for us to be intimate in different ways and more frequently.

I think sexually compatibility is very important, so I'm wondering what I should do. Thoughts? Opinions? Am I too young to have this issue in a relationship? Is it even worth it to continue if we can't fix this or if I can't shake the feeling that he would basically be akin to a sex doll for me considering he doesn't like it?

He said that all I have to do is ask, but after he said he thinks it&amp;#39;s a chore and that he likes to get it over as quick as possible, it feels like asking and him saying &amp;quot;Sure&amp;quot; would be a lie. As if he is doing it just to appease me. While I can appreciate his attempt to compromise, that doesn&amp;#39;t change the fact that I would always be aware that he is uninterested and waiting for me to be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: My boyfriend thinks sex with me is a chore and doesn&amp;#39;t care if we do it even though I would like for us to be intimate in different ways and more frequently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think sexually compatibility is very important, so I&amp;#39;m wondering what I should do. Thoughts? Opinions? Am I too young to have this issue in a relationship? Is it even worth it to continue if we can&amp;#39;t fix this or if I can&amp;#39;t shake the feeling that he would basically be akin to a sex doll for me considering he doesn&amp;#39;t like it?&lt;/p&gt;

Am I obligated to come out to them and give them a chance, or can I just cut them off without explanation at this point?**

Hey guys, I've commented on here a few times in the last couple of months, and you've been very helpful during a difficult time for me, so I thought this would be a good place to turn for advice.

I've recently stopped drinking the Catholic kool aid, and finally accepted my sexuality.  I went through 17 miserable years of being committed to celibacy (since I was 14, I'm 31 now), repressing and denying my sexuality, and I realized that it had left me totally wrecked psychologically and emotionally, and that I couldn't continue living that way. So I finally left the church, and opened myself to the possibility of having a romantic relationship in the future.

I'm mad at myself for depriving myself of some great and healthy experiences in life. I'll never get my twenties back, I'll never know what it's like to be young and in love, and I wasted the peak years of my attractiveness being ashamed and alone.  I was never a virulent homophobe or anything, I never preached at my gay friends or even explained why I didn't date or go out to gay bars with them; I even supported LGBT civil rights (including marriage) because I thought it was unfair to impose religious beliefs with the force of law. And I defended gay people and their relationships in my religious circles, because I realized that they objectively weren't the depraved, terrible sin that they were made out to be.  I just thought God forbade them for mysterious reasons, not because they were inherently bad.  

Even so, I feel terribly guilty for apologizing for homophobic religious teachings all those years. I realize that in a way I was worse than the shrill bigots, because I gave those kinds of beliefs a veneer of reasonableness by not sounding so hateful.  I'm so sorry, guys; I was just brainwashed, but I probably unintentionally made your lives harder, and I feel just awful about that now. 

Anyway, a good therapist has really helped me come to terms with things, and during our sessions I realized that growing up with rigid, demanding, zealous parents who kind of hated me for being gentle, bookish, and quiet was a big part of why I thought it was believable that God would make such cruel demands of me. I was always the black sheep of my family.  My older brother knocked his girlfriend up in high school (they're married now), but because he was more the kind of son my dad wanted than I was, my dad always treated him a lot better than me.  He gave him a cushy job at his company straight out of high school, a downpayment for his first house, and never stopped bragging to his friends about what a great athlete he was.  Anything I did was invisible, though.  I always excelled in school, but my parents didn't give me a dime to go to university; I put myself through my undergrad, graduate studies, and PhD, and despite my invitations, they didn't show up when I was awarded any of my degrees.

I've been distancing myself from them for the last couple of years. I only visit them once or twice a year now, and almost never call them anymore. I got tired of their incessant criticism, and their uncomfortable questions about when I was going to get married and give them grandchildren. They're also reprehensible bigots who think gay people should be rounded up and executed by firing squad (not even hyperbole).  My dad got arrested and sentenced to probation once for assaulting his (now ex) friend's son just because he got an earring. He ripped it out and tore the poor kid's ear practically in half, all because he was offended that he would show up to our house ""looking like a sissy.""

Anyway, I'm starting to come out to my larger circle of friends and colleagues now; I'm tired of living an inauthentic life and only being honest with a handful of gay friends.  But a big part of me just wants to cut my family off completely at this point.  We've never had a good relationship, I feel virtually certain that their reaction to my being gay would be downright hateful (regardless of the fact that I've been celibate my entire life).  I just don't know whether I'm obligated to give them one last chance to accept me, or at least an explanation for why I don't want to have a relationship with them anymore. Would it be so terrible of me to just not pick up the phone when they call, not answer their emails, and stop visiting them?  Given the way they've always treated me, I don't think they'll miss me much, and the feeling would certainly be mutual...","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR My parents seriously messed me up with their religious BS and emotional abuse, but now I&amp;#39;ve finally learned to accept myself.

And you guys seem to be good at that. A little backstory. I used to be very big. Almost 500 pounds big, and just recently I've lost around 150+ pounds and am still working towards my goal. Now this is great. I feel amazing and have new confidence. And now with this new confidence I decided to try and give dating a whirl. Now where I live apps and dating sites seem to be the way to meet people because there is no gay bar down the street. I've gone out with two guys, nothing really came of it, but that's okay. What I'm having problems with is I seem to think about guys and dating all the time, and I seem to care too much what some guy thinks of me after chatting for a day. Basically I feel a little overwhelmed and stupid. I feel dumb for falling for some guys charms and even dumber that I'm hurt by it. I didn't date in my twenties. I've never had a relationship. I'm 31 now. I'm so happy about this new chapter what I can have in life now. I can go to amusement parks and get on a plane. But now I'm sad more than I should be because some guy doesn't like me. I also feel like I'm 100 steps behind where I should be. And I feel like a fool because I don't know how to date. Anything you guys can say would be greatly appreciated even if it's a kick in my ass. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I need advise. And you guys seem to be good at that. A little backstory. I used to be very big. Almost 500 pounds big, and just recently I&amp;#39;ve lost around 150+ pounds and am still working towards my goal. Now this is great. I feel amazing and have new confidence. And now with this new confidence I decided to try and give dating a whirl. Now where I live apps and dating sites seem to be the way to meet people because there is no gay bar down the street. I&amp;#39;ve gone out with two guys, nothing really came of it, but that&amp;#39;s okay. What I&amp;#39;m having problems with is I seem to think about guys and dating all the time, and I seem to care too much what some guy thinks of me after chatting for a day. Basically I feel a little overwhelmed and stupid. I feel dumb for falling for some guys charms and even dumber that I&amp;#39;m hurt by it. I didn&amp;#39;t date in my twenties. I&amp;#39;ve never had a relationship. I&amp;#39;m 31 now. I&amp;#39;m so happy about this new chapter what I can have in life now. I can go to amusement parks and get on a plane. But now I&amp;#39;m sad more than I should be because some guy doesn&amp;#39;t like me. I also feel like I&amp;#39;m 100 steps behind where I should be. And I feel like a fool because I don&amp;#39;t know how to date. Anything you guys can say would be greatly appreciated even if it&amp;#39;s a kick in my ass. &lt;/p&gt;
