I mean, how do you deal with the ""afterward awkwardness""? I'm perfectly fine with guys not contacting me again (or the opposite) when it's clearly a hook-up.

But when I go on a date with a guy, take a drink, talk about everything and eventually get turned on (so does the other guy), which obviously lead to sex... How to 'keep the interest' afterward?

I'm perfectly fine with seeing the guys again even post-sex. I have a very high sex-drive, but the heart of a child (as in, I'm a hopeless romantic etc who wants a relationship), so I wouldn't mind if the guy I slept with contacted me again to hang out or even do it again. I've heard tales of working relationships on both side of the coin (no sex on 1st date/sex on 1st date), so it's not an utopia. It *can* work. 

But I've yet to meet another (gay?) guy like that. So far, the interest drop instantly for one or the other and I don't know how to manage that. Self-control and abstinence could be a solution, but it's one hard thing to achieve when both want it (and when one of them has no issue with sex at all). Plus, it's a date, as in ""we get to know each other"", not a hookup. Maybe I'm being naive, but I don't put dates in the same category as hookups. For me, a date has potential of having a second or a third round if it clicks...

Yet, even if it clicks, even if we both have tons of common interest, even if we both have potential, even if we both find the other one hot/sexy, even if we're both horny, it seems like once we go down, the other guy just goes elsewhere afterward. And this makes me a lil' bit sad.

A bit before Christmas I met an awesome guy on grindr that was at a school near me, same age as me. We hit it off really well and it was just really sweet you know? We liked each other in terms of looks and personality. We are both closeted.

We make plans to meet in person, but as the weeks keep passing by, he always flakes. He'd still text me, but it always went back and forth between being really passionate and having so much chemistry, to not even acknowledging me.

Near Valentines Day I ask him what the hell is up with him, and he tells me things like 'I can't see myself with a guy, I'm really religious and I hate grindr I wish I never downloaded it and got myself into this mess.' He's had sexual experience before, but never actually been intimate or kissed a guy. I was heartbroken, because of all the sweet things we would tell each other about being each others first on a lot of things (I kissed a guy before, but nothing sexual).

He tells me it would be ok if we're just friends, and I obliged. I put my feelings away for him, and he told me before we both graduate (which we just did in  the end of May), we would meet up and hang out. Which still ended up not happening.

After graduation, I find out he's been on grindr and a bunch of other hookup apps since May, and well...the awkward moment when he messaged me on grindr not knowing it's me. And we talked and it was such a good conversation but it killed me inside finding out it's him and hearing him say all these things to me about how we would make such good friends and would get along so well, knowing that all these months passed and he never once bothered to meet me in person, and on the contrary just didn't give a shit about the friendship he said we could have (since he told me he liked me a lot and then regretted it and rejected me when I started to have feelings for him).

So I confronted him over text about this and it kind of just became a disaster, with both of us being bitter and cutting each other off from all social networks. As a last resort, in a confused mess, I confronted him again through Facebook messenger (we don't have each other added, but we have mutual friends) asking him why he did and said the stuff he did and contradicted himself like that. He didn't really answer my question but he just kept telling me he's sorry and he doesn't know what he wants in life, he doesn't know who he is and how he's sorry and that I'm a good guy and deserve someone better. I felt really guilty and just told him he'll figure it out eventually and that he should just be really careful in general on those apps and whatnot. He told me he appreciated what I wrote a lot and told me thanks.

That was the last interaction with him I had and I just don't know how I feel...you can't really explain these feelings in texts especially when I make him out to be the bad guy for rejecting me and leading me on like that, when deep down I still have feelings for him that I tried so hard to put away but can't. I seriously feel like I fell in love with him and it didn't happen immediately, it sort of just grew and grew. I keep reading all our texts from the beginning when we first started talking and I feel that twisted feeling in your chest and stomach and it fucking hurts man. 

He's going out of state for college, and I'm so depressed now thinking about how I'l never see him again and how we're not even friends anymore, but it's like we never even were, he never gave us a chance. It hurts to think that he behaved the way he did towards me and still at the end went back on grindr, to look for what? Sex? A relationship? Just a friend to talk to? Did I just not exist in that case? Fuck, now I'm writing this and I feel so angry and bitter and spiteful, it's like I go through a range of emotions thinking about him and I don't want to let go either, it hurts. It hurts to think I could have experienced something so special with someone I fell in love with, who I thought loved me back. Obviously it was going to end eventually, but all those months that I'l never get back, just gone. Now I'm so scared of growing up and college and scared of being alone and not finding someone like him that I feel so strongly for and I keep thinking what his life and future is going to be like too. 

Why should it be so easy for me to maintain friendships with other guys and girls, and he could do that too with his group of friends, but it was such a train wreck with each other? Why didn't we work out all these months ON ANY LEVEL, ROMANTIC OR PLATONIC, if he tells me on grindr not knowing it is me, that he gets along with me and we'd make good friends and it's so refreshing to talk to someone like me... I just want those happy moments back dammit. I want to feel that excitement again that we had in the beginning, but I can't. And it's like, how does he honestly feel about it? What is the next person he gets with going to have that I don't? 

I want to send another message on Facebook apologizing and just trying to salvage whatever is left of this train wreck, not for a friendship but just to soothe my mind and guilt over what I did say and hope that one of us can get something beneficial out of this. He would mention to me on grindr that he's cynical and doesn't trust people easily because of past experiences, how he's been led on before and stuff and idk man. I know people say here to do no contact and to just cut someone out especially if they cut you out or don't want to have anything to do with you, but that hurts so much. How can I expect to learn something or get my feelings out or find out what the other person really felt if I don't communicate? 

**tl;dr Met a guy on grindr who I fell in love with before Christmas, he told me he felt the same towards me, but then coldly began to not acknowledge me a couple months later.

I have been using Grindr for 3 weeks and I have never felt more liberated from shunning my feelings for guys that I have had to do for so long than at this moment. I met some great people and had a couple of fun times. Now, I have to admit that my self esteem is not the best and having that rush of feeling wanted is amazing.

I was messaged by a guy today. I thought that he looked great and he seemed like a nice guy, so not too long after sending a few messages back and forth, we already made a plan to meet up. He had a car so he offered to pick me up, to which I agreed (sex and a ride to and back? DEAL.) We got to his place and we started making out. A bunch of other foreplay stuff later, he asks me if I wanted to have sex without a condom. I said, ""no, you HAVE to use a condom,"" almost mockingly, because I could not believe he would even consider barebacking. I see him get the condom and actually put it on so I thought, alright, we're gonna play safe. Not too long and we were already having anal. Fast forward minutes into it, he asks me, ""you're negative, right?"" and I said yes, then he asks me if I like the feeling, and I just say yeah. ""Good, because I'm fucking you without a condom right now."" I got a head rush from that and I seriously couldn't think straight. I think I shouted ""WHAT"" at him. He said he was negative but I didn't care and I go tell him to put one back on, and he asks me what the point was if he's already been fucking me without a condom for a few minutes. I didn't know what to do and I'm still panicking because I don't know what to do in this situation. I was scared and pathetic. This guy was at least twice my size and he was dedicated on barebacking. The least I was able to do was get him to not cum in my ass. I tried my hardest to have sex with him. I didn't feel like I had any control over the situation. I felt like I was being raped and I had to stare at him while he did it. I felt scared of this guy and I had to pretend like everything was okay and that I was enjoying what he was doing because he might turn violent. I'm pretty sure I was already fucking crying in my head when he forced me to take his cum in my mouth. I had to endure looking at him throughout the time after, post sex and shower, all while trying my best to minimize the amount of times that I had to kiss him when he leaned over. I just thought, this guy was my ride home, and I have no way of getting home if he doesn't drive me back.

I don't know what to do. This is only my sixth sexual encounter with a guy, and I feel like I am ruined. I have broken down on the side of the road while I walked aimlessly trying to get my head together after he dropped me off. I have no idea what to do now. I have contemplated suicide already. He has brought the suggestion of being fuck buddies numerous times in our time together, and I ignored all of them. He asked me about meeting up next week, to which I just explain that I am a busy person and that I don't even know what my schedule is. This guy knows the building where I live. I was able to give him a fake name fortunately, but I still feel paranoid, and I don't want to leave my house. He has my number too and he said that we would be keeping in touch and I just jokingly laugh and said ""we'll see hehe.""
