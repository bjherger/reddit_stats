I feel so lonely. I have really close friends, but I still have this gap in me. I am a gay 24 year old Mexican boy who just this year had a first kiss, and a few months prior had finally accepted and embraced being gay, but despite my efforts I just can't find anyone... I thought that by accepting it I'd just be able to find someone and be happy. Apparently not... 

I use many apps including Grindr and Tinder, and though I did meet a boy several months ago (the one who gave this first kiss), it's just been one hope surge after another, followed by a downfall each. They get my hopes up and then vanish without a trace. Being smart and nice and looking for love makes it harder, strangely. It's almost as if you can't meet anyone unless you're willing to have meaningless sex with them, which I'm not. Also, there's just no one I like around me, not that anyone that's gay as well anyway. And though I know maybe going to clubs and stuff is better than apps, I don't like clubs and would hate getting my hopes up for nothing again.

So, does anyone have some advice with this?

I've recently been talking to a guy (all day every day) who will soon be moving from abroad to the same city I study in for university. We initially started talking with just intentions of being friends, then things started to change. We both always wanted to see one another and have exchanged hundreds of photos (all SFW). We've been discussing possible relationships once he moves here, and how we'll give things ago as we seems to like everything about one another.

However, after a weekend of not talking due to being away with friends at home, there was a further day of no communication until the evening. The guy expressed to me his worry of feeling like he shouldn't have gone away and instead stayed committed to some ongoing studies. He spent the entire Saturday morning looking over our photos, and missing talking to me all the time. After, saying he received some messages I sent (there was little stable internet where he was staying) that he had mixed feelings. First feeling relieved he got to hear from me, then realising ""it's kinda crazy we're so attached to one another"". Followed by some worrying about whether it's a healthy situation. That he's confused.

After asking what he meant, he explain that if we're like we are now and we've yet to meet, once he moves over here, he ""bets"" he's going to become too dependent on me. I'll be the only person I know here and we'll want to spend a lot of time with one another (an idea he loves). But he's afraid it'll stop him from getting on over here when he moves. He's worried that he will end up spending all his free time with me, and won't get the opportunity to make new friend, meet new people and to see how he can cope on his own. I can understand the worry he has, as it is a new city in a brand new country.

He says he's still trying to figure our what he thinks about what he told me, but felt I deserve to know what his mind is up to. After me saying there isn't much I can say, said he'd love to hear what I think and that I could clear his thoughts. 

After a little more conversation he said the same thing. He's worried he will be depending too much on me and me too much on him. That the whole relationship could be too much to handle as soon as he arrives (even though I don't really want to get right into a deep, serious relationship on Day 1). I've told him that to me sex is incredibly special, I only want to have it with the guy I adore and potentially spend the rest of my life with. He even says he knows himself how I want things to happen and to come about, but the second thoughts he's having are making him wonder if he's that guy for me. 

We've spoken openly about how much we like one another, and another point he brought up was how he knows he will feel so comfortable with me, he likes me. And he fears he could get really intimate with me right away, saying that he can't say for sure he'll be the man I want him to be. I only want him to be himself, because he as he is, is the only guy I want him to be. 

Finally, he said that it's too much pressure. I'm not sure if it's just the entire relationship consideration thing, or that in combination with the stress from his studies. I asked if he wants us to sort this, to which he replied he need to make up his mind on what he wants, that he can't start something like that with me if he's not 100% sure it's what is best for both of us.

I realise that's a massive read and I thank anyone who took the time to read it. I appreciate it. Hugely. I guess I just want to know what guys think I should do, or say. I'm a little confused, I really do want something to happen badly. I just don't know how to respond, or what to say.

So... yeah... Helps? :)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall of text incoming, guys.&lt;/p&gt;

About two months prior to that, me and this guy, who is still a student at the college started hanging out and deciding we really liked each other. My plan was to get hired somewhere at/near the college, so we weren't too worried about our relationship. We parted in May with a ""see ya in the fall.""

We communicated all summer. Things were fine all summer. I worked a summer job. I got a little bit too busy with that job to look for work in the fall as actively as I probably should've. The end result: The semester started at the school a week ago, and I'm not local yet because I don't have work in the area. I'm still looking for work in the area. Not because of this guy--the area makes a lot of sense for me for about 100 different reasons, I have additional physical limitations that I know how to navigate in the area, and I'd be looking there no matter what.

However, since I'm not there, and since college campuses can be a bit of a bubble, my relationship partner feels like we're in separate worlds right now, and I agree with him whole-heartedly. He said he's uncomfortable committing to a relationship when it feels like there's so much effort necessary in bridging the gap right now, and we talked for a couple of hours, and basically just reached the conclusion that if our lives realign, the relationship talk is a very real conversation to revisit, because we had a great thing starting up, but it's not practical right now, especially since we were still in the honeymoon phase when we split up in May. If I get work near the campus, I will be on campus regularly, and then we'll go from there, see what feels... correct. There's a lot of liking on both sides, but to say we're dating now... It would be in name only.

I'm already feeling a ton of anxiety because finding work is hard. I can't drive, so I'm limited to basically the downtown area of the city, where I can get to work/groceries/ect. I have people willing to rent an apartment with me when I find employment, but nothing solid yet.... because I'm not employed. One thing that was keeping me optimistic was the thought of reuniting with this guy, because no matter how rough things were, I was starting to feel SUPER comfortable with him... but now that's on hold indefinitely/for now/who knows.

I just feel like everything is riding on my ability to find work. I'm confident I will work something out, but I feel like I'm losing control of everything in the meantime.

&lt;p&gt;Also have a much older booty call (60 year old man).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been seeing him for about 1.5 years...about 10 times in total so far.  I&amp;#39;m a bottom, he&amp;#39;s a top.  We like 420 and poppers.  He loves to kiss my body, give me head (he swallows) and top me (condoms of course).  I like to make out with him and bottom.  I&amp;#39;ve never given him head, but I really want to.  I&amp;#39;m afraid of stds.  He says he is clean.  Should I suck him or avoid it?&lt;/p&gt;

Basically, I grew up with this guy. I've always pegged him for straight and maybe I still do. He's insanely attractive, smart, funny, sweet, and athletic. First off, I definitely have had/do have feelings for this guy so I guess that's a cardinal rule broken right there.

But here's what happened: We went out clubbing one night and were everything but sober when we got back home. Queue sexual tension. I convinced myself I made it up and went to sleep.

Two weeks later, I get a dick pic. By ""accident."" Okay..

Well this weekend we were at a party together drinking and blazing all day/night. Tension from the start. Everyone goes to bed and then I get a message from him on my phone - ""suck my dick.""

And I did. Almost without hesitation. We went outside and out of sight and did the deed. I was pretty intoxicated and consequently sloppy. Not my best work by a long shot.

After he came he said ""That felt really good, but I don't know man I'm sorry. I'm just don't know.."" Then I apologized? A few times. And was like ""oh, it's cool"", brushed my knees off and kissed his neck out of sheer awkwardness.

We both said something to the effect of ""nothing's going to be weird between us, I love you man."" and hugged it out. I went inside to clean up while he went to bed.

We haven't spoken of it since and I honestly don't know if I should say anything/what I would say even if I did.

Was I just an experiment? Did I mess up by messing around with this guy who I'm going to be around for the rest of my life?

I really like him but I don't know if I could ever expect anything more than what happened this weekend.

Over the past week or so, a lot of threads that relate to whatever situation my love life is going through atm have been popping up and answering questions I have but don't want to ask. 

Currently interested in a 31 year old guy (I'm 21) and I've noticed a few threads pop up with people asking about age differences etc. Even today in the ELI5 sub there was an answer from a user who is 30 dating a 20 year old girl:

&gt;Basically, if people have a problem with (legal) age differences in relationships it's because they themselves are insecure and still attempting to define an identity. This is why they're so hung up on outside metrics (age) to attempt evaluation of other people. They're still unaware, internally, what a person is. They haven't become one yet. Many people never do.
Once a person has forged an actual identity, they recognize that age means very little so far as meaningful interpersonal relationships. Let 'em hate. It doesn't affect me anyway.


I love that so much, honestly it's something I'll probably say to the guy I'm interested in because he is interested in me but I have this gut feeling, which is normally right unfortunately, that he's worried what people will think if anything serious ever came about because of the age difference. 

Also, at the minute, he got called back to another country for work. He's a scientist who works pay check to pay check not a steady 9-5. We were chatting and he said he definitely wants coffee when he gets back and asked me to check in with him to let him know how I was getting on. Well, I did and he hasn't replied. He always does reply and once before it took him a week to reply but he's very busy and also quite forgetful. Yesterday there was a post written about someone not replying to a text even though they're online on Grindr and another user wrote this to the OP that just clicked with me: 

&gt;The better question is why are you keeping tabs on his Grindr activity, and is it your business to be doing so?
""Busy"" means ""I'm doing something that is occupying my time"". He could be walking the dog, cleaning the house, going on Grindr... it doesn't matter. He is occupied with something that doesn't involve you. Unless you've agreed to start an exclusive relationship, you have no ground to stand on.
If you're losing a good feeling because he isn't dropping everything to talk to you, that's on you. 

Literally this one post made me go 'Ooh. Ok' and something in my head has clicked and quelled the fire in my head that made me overthink. 

I said earlier in the post that this guy is quite forgetful which is something I wouldn't have found out if I hadn't went my original route to where I was meeting him on our date. Basically, I was walking through the city centre and said to myself: 'Right I'll go *this* way to City Hall' but then I just had this feeling that I should go another way. I did and I ended up meeting him outside a bookstore (which is near City Hall) writing an email on his phone. He said to me that he's sorry for ignoring me but he really needed to send this email otherwise he'd forget. I then asked him how his weekend was and he looked so lost and just told me: 'If it isn't happening today I forget. I'm very forgetful.' This sounds so stupid but I do feel like this was more than a coincidence and finding out he was forgetful, something that wouldn't of happened if I went my original route, then I would definitely be freaking out 100% because he has forgot to reply to a stupid text, lol. 

EDIT: Just wanted to add for a bit of context, I am a bit of a spiritual person and I do believe what you put out there you will get back. Whether it's the Law of Attraction or whether it's karma I do feel like things happen for reasons :)
