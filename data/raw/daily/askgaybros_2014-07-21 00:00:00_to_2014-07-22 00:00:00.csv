Hey guys, I bought my own place a few months ago and I'm finally living in my new condo suite within the past month. It's pretty awesome and I have a pool, hot tub, steam room, gym that goes with the monthly condo fees. 

Since a week ago, I've been pretty bored after work and I find myself browsing through CL's casual encounters section, replying to ads and posting some of my own. I've had at least one hook up every day for the past 5 days doing various (safe) things.

It's a great self-esteem booster because I wasn't too confident with how I looked (I can also include being Asian into the discussion...) but after those encounters it felt amazing and I want to continue -- so far all the guys I've met were great and within my age range, albeit NSA. On the other hand, one side of me thinks it's not healthy and it's becoming an addiction, and my mind is telling me that I'm bound to have a bad encounter that I will definitely regret.

Any tips on how I can overcome this? I've been trying to get myself involved with other activities around the city after work but I still find myself with spare time to have a quick jerk session with someone else. I appreciate any advice.

Still, I'm met with constant rejection and I don't understand what I'm doing wrong.

I'm moving to a new city and apartment in the next few weeks. As I'll be moving to NYC I couldn't afford to get a place on my own so I needed a roommate. The guy seems ok, he does similar work and is fine with having a gay roommate. Before someone asks, there's no attraction so no swooning over the roommate.

I've pretty much lived on my own since leaving my parents place so living with anyone else is still pretty new to me. Are you guys able to give tips or advice? Should we be talking about certain things in terms of apartment rules/policy? Any particular situations as a gay guy especially?
