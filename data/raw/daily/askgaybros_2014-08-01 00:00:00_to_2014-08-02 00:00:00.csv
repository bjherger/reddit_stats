I know this might not be the right subreddit to ask this, but I kind of want to see your opinion.

So basically I was doing an internship at this big company and I got interviewed for a permanent position and my boss told me that I had to improve my English skills, so he told me he will reevaluate me in two months. The question is do you guys know a website where I can learn how to English better without any cost? or any other suggestion to improve my english abilities? 

Any suggestion will be well received, thanks in advance.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello bros, &lt;/p&gt;

He's 18 and I'm 23 so there is that too. I would describe him as my first love (I've had a few boyfriends in my time). 

He has had a rough past and a rough upbringing which I understand. I haven't had the easiest run either. Also, anyone in their 20's dating a late teenager could tell you it can be a trial at times. Like me he had to grow up fast but some things it seems will always be tied to age.

As we've been together, I have noticed that he can be really irresponsible with his money. New job splurges and all that. This is fine of course. His money, his life, his choices and all that.

What I do worry about is he is looking to move out of home (again) but does not have any savings and will still buy a coffee at work, or some new clothes and end up broke again before pay day. And now I've found out he is getting a credit card to cover his father's debt on his father's ex-girlfriend's house (bf and the ex-gf are close, his father is an abusive alcoholic and half owns the house that she lives in but he does not due to a restraining order). Without the money she loses the house.

The debt his father owes is just under $20,000. That is twenty thousand dollars for those of you who think I may have made a typo. Also the bf refuses to discuss it with me as he knows I somwehat strongly disapprove.

I do love this guy, I really do. I cannot believe a woman in her 40's would allow an 18 year old to absorb such a debt and I cannot justify pursuing a future with someone so bad at taking care of their life.

Tl; dr, 18yo bf is tsking in a $20,000 debt with little chance if repayment and that is too irresponsible to keep dating but oh shit I love him still.

Sometimes when im sitting amongst a group of friends, i am a bit put off by what i perceive as an intense differential between my life and theirs.  I worry greatly that in the pensive moments of bubbling silence we all brood, separately but maybe even equally.  I always tell myself I just have it the worst; it helps my case when someone gets called gay.  Theyre not gay - I'm gay.  They always seem to forget.  Or maybe they just dont care.

Maybe everyone's private struggle is what keeps them shoddily riveted to the formality of their daily routine.  I could see it in their clothes: the best friends who split up, one a party gypsy the other done up in fraternity finery.  Oh but to have such an irreconcilable difference.  At least they dont know what its like when one person is gay, and loves another person that's not.

Where do they go when their eyes leave the conversation, trailing along the familiar stains of a worn carpet, or lifting across the splintered plaster of a felt-up wall?  But that's not what I'm concerned about.  What I am concerned about is if anyone else around me is concerned about me like I am concerned about them, about them all.  My whole life of dejection and introspection and reflection only leads me to believe the only joys in life worth pursuing are those of intrapersonal comforts.  

I live for the stories I tell others, for the spirits I cultivate in the garden within my heart, each one of my friends so precious.  I guess I just think that way about people who in spite of the odds have shown me kindness to any degree.  I have plenty of people that love me, but what stings is the people that didnt love me.  What about them?  Do they know that I love them despite my self-imposed isolation.  What I mean is that, when opportunity shows to grace the palm of life's goings-on, I too often have chosen abstinence.  I abstain from outings or events, because I dont want to be the only gay person there.  And even if Im not, the other ones there arent very much like me.  They are loud and confident and in everyone's face and they dont seem to take much to subtlety when it comes to noticing me.  I guess Im doing it wrong.

Does everyone else think that way, when for them I have only the memories that make me stronger?  Do they act on their implulsory rejection of the me that I am versus the me as they would most comfortably tolerate me?  Am I just a concept to these people, or do they have an interest or investment in my futures as I consider myself to have in theirs.  I talk to them, I follow their lives, but I guess there is no way to assert that I am listening intently.  I remember every day, the ones where we sat half-passed out until the early AM drunkenly slopping stories.  I remember each time I was touched, or held, or sat next to, or given an shoulder to lean on or a place to sleep.  But I know they dont treat me like they treat each other sometimes - I have to work for that.  Is their natural state to avoid me somehow?  

I just wanted to be one of the boys.  Always, just to hang with the guys.  As a little kid id sit by my phone and wait on baited breath for a ring, a sleepover, to go skateboarding - I never could very well I was just perfectly content to watch and be a part of it.  I guess I have always been very preoccupied with my thoughts.  I could wakeboard a little and golf, and I could pick out good looking girls from the crowd.  I just cant imagine that any of them knew what I wanted most was to just be a part of their lives instead.  I didnt want much for myself back then, confused with my identity and in loathing of the form I was taking on.  For all my effort to refuse myself it all seems so pointless now; it had been a long time coming and I wasnt ever going to stop from being who I had to be.  I guess I never really wanted it this way.

I wanted to be one of the boys, not to have a crush on every single one of them.  I wanted to know how guys talked to each other when there werent any girls in the room, or what they did when it was just three of them on the prowl around the neighborhoods tearing it up.  I wanted to be free of myself.  Well when they are in front of me I feel a shade of what this must be like, but there is no arguing my exclusion from these most private gatherings.  I know a gay person just doesnt belong there; I cant live in a house with 3 of my closest guy friends because not only do I think they are the coolest people I know, I think they are the three cutest people I know.  

And everytime I see them I think of what I wanted to be and what I am instead.  I worry not about lost time, I worry most about the time thats left to come that is most likely to be wasted.  Where does that leave me?  I have a couple gay friends, one even here but he has treated me disrespectfully and I cant imagine how other guys have put up with his behavior.  He went off and played guitar with a few others, something he's picked up in his free time away from grindr.  

The other gay boys I know are christians, or drag queens, or have been described at gay establishments as ""all woman"".  I gave a server my number the other day, folded over the pen he forgot at my table.  He seemed instantly interested in me, but I made a total fool of myself.  ""I need a second look, got anything in mind?"" he says.  Oh the only place my mind went to: ""my place"" was the response.  He laughed and took me on a beach volleyball date with his friends the next day.  I had a great time, and I dont think he was interested in me.  I always wanted to be, but I guess im not the rugged prince charming I can sometimes make myself out to be, that others make me out to be. 

I guess, despite everything I ever wanted for myself, I turned out an emotionally damaged, psychologically baggaged, hopelessly gay loner.  I dont think any of my friends would even say this about me, but sitting in this room I cant help but think thats what the electrochemical responsory mechanisms are telling them to think about me, and by grace of their conscious refusal to acknowledge them I am spared the humiliation. I think they want to like me, but I never quite became the person they wanted me to be, the person I wanted to be.  Instead of someone Im no one, formless and blank and in an endless suspension awaiting some cryptically precise input to reignite the dwindling passion I used to think could conquer the world.  Now I just want to get to bed by 9.  

I just wanted to be one of the boys, I cant think that is so wrong to have wanted for myself.  My closest friend walks by three times that night and scratches the hair on my head.  He gives me a big hug before I leave.  

Thats what I wanted.  But I dont know if I wanted it as the person I wanted to be - one of the guys, or I wanted it as the person I am - hopelessly gay.  Yet still I can have neither.  

I used to dream about him very much.  Hes one of the most adorable looking human beings I have ever met.  Hes big and not too tall and loves aqua teen hunger force and gets all my jokes and always includes me or is quick to offer me a chance at fun.  I used to dream that he would take me in and I would be his best friend and I would get to be around him all the time.  I used to dream that one day he would kiss me.  But ill never be like him, and ill never have him.  And everything I think I want I know will never be.

&lt;p&gt;I live for the stories I tell others, for the spirits I cultivate in the garden within my heart, each one of my friends so precious.  I guess I just think that way about people who in spite of the odds have shown me kindness to any degree.  I have plenty of people that love me, but what stings is the people that didnt love me.  What about them?  Do they know that I love them despite my self-imposed isolation.  What I mean is that, when opportunity shows to grace the palm of life&amp;#39;s goings-on, I too often have chosen abstinence.  I abstain from outings or events, because I dont want to be the only gay person there.  And even if Im not, the other ones there arent very much like me.  They are loud and confident and in everyone&amp;#39;s face and they dont seem to take much to subtlety when it comes to noticing me.  I guess Im doing it wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does everyone else think that way, when for them I have only the memories that make me stronger?  Do they act on their implulsory rejection of the me that I am versus the me as they would most comfortably tolerate me?  Am I just a concept to these people, or do they have an interest or investment in my futures as I consider myself to have in theirs.  I talk to them, I follow their lives, but I guess there is no way to assert that I am listening intently.  I remember every day, the ones where we sat half-passed out until the early AM drunkenly slopping stories.  I remember each time I was touched, or held, or sat next to, or given an shoulder to lean on or a place to sleep.  But I know they dont treat me like they treat each other sometimes - I have to work for that.  Is their natural state to avoid me somehow?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just wanted to be one of the boys.  Always, just to hang with the guys.  As a little kid id sit by my phone and wait on baited breath for a ring, a sleepover, to go skateboarding - I never could very well I was just perfectly content to watch and be a part of it.  I guess I have always been very preoccupied with my thoughts.  I could wakeboard a little and golf, and I could pick out good looking girls from the crowd.  I just cant imagine that any of them knew what I wanted most was to just be a part of their lives instead.  I didnt want much for myself back then, confused with my identity and in loathing of the form I was taking on.  For all my effort to refuse myself it all seems so pointless now; it had been a long time coming and I wasnt ever going to stop from being who I had to be.  I guess I never really wanted it this way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to be one of the boys, not to have a crush on every single one of them.  I wanted to know how guys talked to each other when there werent any girls in the room, or what they did when it was just three of them on the prowl around the neighborhoods tearing it up.  I wanted to be free of myself.  Well when they are in front of me I feel a shade of what this must be like, but there is no arguing my exclusion from these most private gatherings.  I know a gay person just doesnt belong there; I cant live in a house with 3 of my closest guy friends because not only do I think they are the coolest people I know, I think they are the three cutest people I know.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And everytime I see them I think of what I wanted to be and what I am instead.  I worry not about lost time, I worry most about the time thats left to come that is most likely to be wasted.  Where does that leave me?  I have a couple gay friends, one even here but he has treated me disrespectfully and I cant imagine how other guys have put up with his behavior.  He went off and played guitar with a few others, something he&amp;#39;s picked up in his free time away from grindr.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other gay boys I know are christians, or drag queens, or have been described at gay establishments as &amp;quot;all woman&amp;quot;.  I gave a server my number the other day, folded over the pen he forgot at my table.  He seemed instantly interested in me, but I made a total fool of myself.  &amp;quot;I need a second look, got anything in mind?&amp;quot; he says.  Oh the only place my mind went to: &amp;quot;my place&amp;quot; was the response.  He laughed and took me on a beach volleyball date with his friends the next day.  I had a great time, and I dont think he was interested in me.  I always wanted to be, but I guess im not the rugged prince charming I can sometimes make myself out to be, that others make me out to be. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess, despite everything I ever wanted for myself, I turned out an emotionally damaged, psychologically baggaged, hopelessly gay loner.  I dont think any of my friends would even say this about me, but sitting in this room I cant help but think thats what the electrochemical responsory mechanisms are telling them to think about me, and by grace of their conscious refusal to acknowledge them I am spared the humiliation. I think they want to like me, but I never quite became the person they wanted me to be, the person I wanted to be.  Instead of someone Im no one, formless and blank and in an endless suspension awaiting some cryptically precise input to reignite the dwindling passion I used to think could conquer the world.  Now I just want to get to bed by 9.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just wanted to be one of the boys, I cant think that is so wrong to have wanted for myself.  My closest friend walks by three times that night and scratches the hair on my head.  He gives me a big hug before I leave.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thats what I wanted.  But I dont know if I wanted it as the person I wanted to be - one of the guys, or I wanted it as the person I am - hopelessly gay.  Yet still I can have neither.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to dream about him very much.  Hes one of the most adorable looking human beings I have ever met.  Hes big and not too tall and loves aqua teen hunger force and gets all my jokes and always includes me or is quick to offer me a chance at fun.  I used to dream that he would take me in and I would be his best friend and I would get to be around him all the time.  I used to dream that one day he would kiss me.  But ill never be like him, and ill never have him.  And everything I think I want I know will never be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where to go from here...&lt;/p&gt;

Cute boy, nice body, great leg and facial hair which keeps me focused on the pace. So I don't mind the company so much. But the kicker is, he talks constantly about is his ex. I mean, every single day. I finally asked one day this week how long they had been broken up. More than a year, he says. 

Now guys, c'mon, I know you have alot going on in your noodle thinking about, i.e., job, student loans, car payment, rent, hair grooming products. But 365+ days of being single and still not over the ex? Am I being a mean old guy?

And is this normal for your age group? Cause frankly, it makes me want to shove a ball gag down his throat. 

I'm single and mildly happy, so I don't stress much. And I don't grindr or scruff so I don't know alot of online gay bros.

Oh, and what would be a good tl;dr for this post? I don't understand those yet.  Thanks in advance. Clom
