I'm coming to the realization that since I came out at 17 (I'm 24 now), I've been hooked on casual sex. My longest relationship was a year and a half, and fizzled out in part due to my sexual disinterest.

I got used to having sex with people with whom I had no emotional connection, and where it was all about the sex. I've been getting into increasingly risky behaviours (sometimes not using a condom, or fantasizing hard about it, sex in public places, smoking pot and using poppers, sex with multiple people in a week's timespan, sex in bathhouses).

When on my own, I get into some pretty wild stuff (last night, for example, I rode this huge dildo hard, for hours, while snorting poppers and drinking wine; I texted with this hung 45-year old, fantasizing about it being his raw cock). 

I also slept with my ex-boyfriend recently. And while I have very deep feelings for him, they got in the way of my being able to get it up (had trouble maintaining an erection, though did in the end). I feel like sex with him just isn't extreme enough to satisfy me, and that I get bored of having sex with just one guy.

I'm worried that I'll never be able to handle emotional and sexual intimacy with one person, since I'm so used to having one or the other. I'm also worried I'm going to make a mistake that results in me becoming HIV+. I know I need the stability of a single partner, but I also know how much I love big, raw cock in my ass.

I find myself compulsively checking a half dozen sex sites (the usual suspects) several times a day. I chat with a bunch of guys fairly regularly, with whom I have semi-regular sex. We swap dirty pics, and sometimes make them together. I've had sex with probably just over a hundred guys since losing my virginity at 17.

Is this just what it is to be a gay man, and to have constant, easy access to casual no-strings-attached sex? Or am I allowing myself to engage in too many indulgences, with poor impulse control? Does anyone have strategies for dealing with something like this?

No doubt this topic has been broached many times before; it seems like a thing which many people are dealing with (damn you, Grindr).

TLDR; I'm worried I'm spoiling myself with regular fantastic casual sex, and that I won't be able to settle down. I wish I could turn back the clock, and regain some self control...","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi r/AskGayBros.&lt;/p&gt;

Now, normally, regardless of how many times I masturbate per day (but I never exceed once or twice), my semen is fairly consistently thick and sticky.

So this two great people in my life met somehow and started dating(it a small town so everybody knows everybody). So i really got surprised and excited when i got to know mike(cousin) and sam(friend) were dating.But then,sam my friend is kinda a cheater,when hes in a relationship....he stills sleeps around with random guys( i really know him inside out) and mike my cousin too,is so sensitive,fragile,shy and much of a dreamer.....always dreaming of having that one guy to himself,a great lavish wedding,probably own a house in the middle of kansas so to have that peace to raise their beautiful kids together....you know,shits like that.
But looking at sam(friend) i know those dreams wouldnt be possible with him(he loves to club,live a free life..all that) so even when he was dating my cousin,he still slept around but i had no reason to tell my cousin bcos i knew that relationship was never going anywhere even though i knew i was being unfaithful to my cousin.
So mike(cousin) just told me,sam( friend) had proposed to him and that they are getting married very soon and more so,both families knows about it and preparations are starting( i kinda travelled ,so my cousin picked me up from airport and then told me) and hes so happy about it.
So i met sam(friend) later and he also gave me the news(great news,i guess)..but even though they are getting married very soon,sam my friend hasnt stopped sleeping around...he is constantly hooking up with any guy he finds attractive....which i dont know whether to tell my cousin about his cheating ways or not and just let them get married...
A part of me wants to let my cousin know bcos hes such a great person and a family member....also, i had talked to sam(friend) about it and he doesnt want to stop  and am also afraid of telling my cousin bcos sam my friend knows some dirty secrets of mine which he could make public if he feels he got betrayed by me for telling my cousin about his ways and wanted revenge.
What am more concerned about is after marriage,bcos obviously my friend would still be sleeping around which would hurt my cousin the more if he gets to know and probably would be mad at me for i knew all along and never said anything despite me knowing about his kinda dream guy...and shutted up bcos he was my friend...
I just dont want to hurt anyone here bcos i would hurt my friend if i told my cousin about him and probably bring an end to the marriage preparations....then again,i would also hurt my cousin if he gets to know the ways of my friend and would be more hurt if he knows i knew about it......and i also dont want to hurt myself bcos my friend could get mad at me for opening my mouth and would make my secrets publicly known....so i just want to know which one of them do i owe my loyalty to.....to my friend or cousin

Tl,dr: so my friend and cousin are getting married but my friend is already cheating and have been ever since.i dont know if i should tell my cousin  bcos hes much of a dreamer who wants his guy to himself and also decides if he wants to back out or just go on bcos he loves my friend.But again,i also dont want to hurt my friend who knows some dirty secrets about me and might want to make them public if he feels he got betrayed....i just want to know who i owe my loyalty to and what to do...

So i really got surprised and excited when i got to know mike(cousin) and sam(friend) were dating.But then,sam my friend is kinda a cheater,when hes in a relationship....he stills sleeps around with random guys( i really know him inside out) and mike my cousin too,is so sensitive,fragile,shy and much of a dreamer.....always dreaming of having that one guy to himself,a great lavish wedding,probably own a house in the middle of kansas so to have that peace to raise their beautiful kids together....you know,shits like that.
But looking at sam(friend) i know those dreams wouldnt be possible with him(he loves to club,live a free life..all that) so even when he was dating my cousin,he still slept around but i had no reason to tell my cousin bcos i knew that relationship was never going anywhere even though i knew i was being unfaithful to my cousin.
So mike(cousin) just told me,sam( friend) had proposed to him and that they are getting married very soon and more so,both families knows about it and preparations are starting( i kinda travelled ,so my cousin picked me up from airport and then told me) and hes so happy about it.
So i met sam(friend) later and he also gave me the news(great news,i guess)..but even though they are getting married very soon,sam my friend hasnt stopped sleeping around...he is constantly hooking up with any guy he finds attractive....which i dont know whether to tell my cousin about his cheating ways or not and just let them get married...
A part of me wants to let my cousin know bcos hes such a great person and a family member....also, i had talked to sam(friend) about it and he doesnt want to stop  and am also afraid of telling my cousin bcos sam my friend knows some dirty secrets of mine which he could make public if he feels he got betrayed by me for telling my cousin about his ways and wanted revenge.
What am more concerned about is after marriage,bcos obviously my friend would still be sleeping around which would hurt my cousin the more if he gets to know and probably would be mad at me for i knew all along and never said anything despite me knowing about his kinda dream guy...and shutted up bcos he was my friend...
I just dont want to hurt anyone here bcos i would hurt my friend if i told my cousin about him and probably bring an end to the marriage preparations....then again,i would also hurt my cousin if he gets to know the ways of my friend and would be more hurt if he knows i knew about it......and i also dont want to hurt myself bcos my friend could get mad at me for opening my mouth and would make my secrets publicly known....so i just want to know which one of them do i owe my loyalty to.....to my friend or cousin&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tl,dr: so my friend and cousin are getting married but my friend is already cheating and have been ever since.i dont know if i should tell my cousin  bcos hes much of a dreamer who wants his guy to himself and also decides if he wants to back out or just go on bcos he loves my friend.But again,i also dont want to hurt my friend who knows some dirty secrets about me and might want to make them public if he feels he got betrayed....i just want to know who i owe my loyalty to and what to do...

To cut to the chase: I'm an 18 year old college freshman. I've recently begun coming out, so now I'm out to all of my closest friends, plus a few more, though not yet to my family. Nearly all of my friends are in relationships, and some are saying that I should start putting myself out there. I, though, figure that I have a lot of time left to start all of that, and I should just focus on my work, studying, organizations, and friends right now. I've started to wonder, though, if I might want to start trying to meet guys and start a relationship. People keep talking about how these are some of the most open years of their lives, and so many of my friends are in solid relationships, that I feel like I'm going to regret foregoing dating and relationships altogether right now. 

Plus, I'm not sure if I believe that the only reason I'm not in a relationship is because I want to focus on other things. For one thing, I've never really been close to men. I grew up spending most of my time with my sister, mom, Gramma, aunts, and (nearly all female) cousins, and all of my close friends are women. I mean, I've had some male friends and acquaintances, but they were never close. I think that some part of me might be a little scared because I don't really know how to really interact with men (to be clear, I'm not some antisocial weirdo. But for some reason, I've never developed a close friendship with a man). 

I've also been a little body conscious. To be clear, I think I look decent, but I was close to being overweight when I started college, and even though I've lost about 15-20 lbs since then, it's still pretty apparent that I'm not fit or thin, which is especially glaring since I go to a school where tanned, fit guys seem to just materialize out of nowhere. 

In short, I know I have some issues. But I don't know what I should be doing to address them, and if I should be spending more time trying to meet more guys. To be clear, I like my organizations, work, studying, and just talking and hanging out with friends. But I still worry that, like the title says, I'm wasting my time.

It was all downhill from there.

Is it a terrible idea to try casually dating guys as long as I explain that there's not much potential for anything to come of it? If so, how do I explain in a way that doesn't scare guys off?

I received a message in the first 15 minutes of posting and, in total - over the course of 12 hours - received 5 texts, 9 replies (via Craigslist directly), and 1 creepy voicemail of a guy breathing heavily.

The kinds of people I got varied extremely, from fitness junkies, bears, older men in their 60s, younger men in their 20s, and a couple occasions where people were looking to cheat on their wives (which is interesting in its own right).


The next day, I switched it up and posted that I was looking to suck dick, and that I was hosting. I received 3 messages over the course of 2 hours, after which it went completely cold. For sake of fairness of this test, I promised myself from the very beginning to not compromise, and this is where the problems started. 2 of those messages were asking for me to come to their house, and that they could not come to mine, another was an Craigslist reply that showed interest but had no follow-up.



The following day, I decided to take it a step further. I posted that I was looking to receive anal sex, providing a condom and lubricant. I stressed that the condom wasn't optional. Again, I stated that I was hosting. This had the most detrimental of results, receiving only two replies. One was a Craigslist reply of a guy saying he couldn't come to me and that I had to come to him, and another was a text from someone saying they were 17 years old and wanted ""car play"" (which, considering this is an offer involving anal sex, would have to involve a pretty spacious car). I promptly turned him down due to the age being so low (I live in the U.S., so 18 is the legal age limit), and that, once again, I was unable to travel regardless.

For sake of fairness, I'm tempted to make a post about offering to give anal sex and be hosting, but I think I already see the trend.

If you're a top, you can host and the bottoms won't mind because there's just not enough tops, so they'll travel to get what they need. Bottoms, on the other hand, are a dime a dozen, and if you can't travel, then there's others that will. Likewise, why should a top come to you when so many bottoms are willing to come to the top?

It's worth noting that I ultimately did not take anyone up on their offers with these ads, and it was strictly a practice of curiosity.

Here's the [original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/2z62s0/help_penis_envy_is_poisoning_our_relationship/) for those of you who didn't see it.

Anyway, a couple of weeks later, my bf is already doing a lot better. He's been to a couple of sessions with a therapist, and I think it's helping him to talk through how he's feeling with a professional. A lot of you suggested just relaxing and not trying so hard to get him there, and that was good advice. We made a point of just fooling around and cuddling, with no expectations. I also really encouraged him to start taking more initiative in bed, and playing a little more dominant has given him some swagger and is starting to make him feel more like a man. I think that's what allowed him to get to Thursday's big development: he came again, which was awesome. I have to give a big thank you to /u/Imunnaomnom for the Hitachi magic wand recommendation; that thing is aptly named, it changed my bf's life! After researching a bunch of toys, I figured that one would be the most likely to stimulate him enough to get him there, so I bought one from a sex shop and surprised him with it last weekend while we were fooling around. He loved it right away; it stimulates the roots of his penis really well, and his prostate is extra sensitive when he's using it on his scars. By Thursday he figured out how to vary the settings the right way, and blew a load during a solo session. He can do it whenever he wants now that he's figured it out. Now I'm just worried that my boyfriend will be unable to stop masturbating, I think he's making up for lost time. Seriously, he must have gone through half of our very extensive porn collection in the last couple days. And he's just as enthusiastic about having sex with me (if not more) as before now that we can just pull out the wand, and he can get there with me.

He's still got some work to do on his self-image, but he's dramatically improved from where he was at the time of my original post.

Dont look for it.  If you are looking to solve my problems with a ""dear abby"" style retort, please just stop reading.  If you have some perspective to offer without telling me I need to write differently, I graciously welcome your input.  Im trying to get some stuff off my chest.

I do alot of things differently because I dont want to feel encircled by the spheres of influence that generally make up more socially well-rounded peoples' lives.  For example, I dont want a credit card because I dont like that society offers me a hand with my credit when they still think its perfectly fine to debate the nature of my existence.  I cant stand hearing about whether or not I am a real person constantly in the media.

I dont like going to places because people recognize me.  When they ask me what Im doing with my life its hard to tell them ""nothing much, I have a dysfunction when it comes to giving back to society or feeling like I should work to become my best self when all around I cant even be myself.""  Everyone in my life just cant wait to tell me how disappointed they are that I am not a nuclear physicist by now.  Its hard to try to explain that its better than the fate I kept trying to plan for myself like putting a bullet in my skull or the one time i just let go of the wheel when i was driving my car home.

But im past the worst years of my life because my sexuality has finally slowed.  If I can reach the ""woe-is-me"" crowd out there, all the time I spent trying to hurt myself I do actually regret because Im just now learning some tricks to self love at the age of 24.  And all I know amounts to a pathetically small view of a happy life but its what i actually have and my contributions to the people I love are enough to keep me going.  

I couldnt ever fit into the gay molds, I cant keep up with the unwritten bodyspeak and hidden gestures that somehow make up gay interactions - suffice it to say that gay people dont often ""get"" me.  In fact, women seem to get me, and I am someone who isnt at all effeminate.  Not that I think its gross, by all means no, I am the gross one!  I work construction all day 6 out of 7 days.  I keep bonsai and a marine reef aquarium (which is quite a feat if you knew anything about saltwater aquariums).  I have a cat who is an amazing specimen of a creature.  I write alot but none of it is very good, like when I was a kid and filled with passion (and drugs).

I guess my litmus test about why I am so down on life, how ive noticed that I dont consider placing myself in any sort of archetype and completely shrug off any kind of expectations for myself, is that I dont have anything to write about.

Ive never been to the old west, how can I write about it when all I know is from the times I spent half-watching gunsmoke or bonanza or whatever my dad had on TV?  Everything I try to come up with makes my characters sound like they are walking through a hallway.  Everything I try to paint looks boring.  

I dont have any desire to have an iphone.  I barely want my current phone on me all the time but the world comes to a grinding halt without it in my experience.  People go psycho when youre not constantly in contact.  I hate that.  I hate communicating in pictogram-format.  As an aside, I always thought the best form of language was using words because they express a deeper intent if you take the time to craft it.  Now my boyfriend just spends at least fifteen minutes a day griping about how he cant get his point across without little pictures of a black man holding a turd or some stupid shit like that.

The kids that I tutor are all in ipad school apparently now.  They can barely keep their eyes focused on the things they are supposed to be learning, which somehow occupies the same brainspace as what I assume their gameboy tells them.  When I ask them what they know, its clear they have it memorized and not the foggiest clue about what it means.  Im so worried for a few of them cause they dont give a crap about school and academics used to be the only thing that kept me grounded in life.  They dont even care about taking notes, they think making squiggles under the words with an e-highlighter is good enough.  How can I get these kids shaken up and get them to appreciate the gravity of life knowing that the same forces have crushed me?

And the biggest set of problems I have is with my boyfriend, whom I love dearly but cannot for the life of me understand.  I always try to think - surely everyone wants to be better.  But he is so messy and I think its cause in the back of his mind he just wants me to do it all cause that will prove to him that Im finally going to be the prince charming he thinks he deserves.  I hate all the backwards fucking tricks and bullshit gay people give each other.  He cant just man the fuck up and tell me what he wants ever.  He cant shift his pride aside for even a microsecond so that I can get him to think about why he shouldnt leave old food everywhere piled on piles.  He cant get over his own bullshit pride for even a microsecond and I know this because when I am bringing something up that requires attention I see him formulating a defense in his eyes.  I see that hes completely filtering out everything I say so that he can totally derail me with a gold nugget like ""well if you would pay for laundry service we wouldnt have this problem"".  Like right now I am crying at work cause I know I cant have my friends over who have flown in town to reconnect with out circles.  I cant have them over cause I am ashamed at the way our home looks and he has none.  He cant lose a single pound, he cant stop annoying me with what apple is doing every moment of every day, he cant stop telling me about what clothes hes bought (which wouldnt be so bad if I knew that it was money I was trying to get him to save so that he might actually buy cleaning supplies for me to do all the cleaning with).  I love him cause hes the same kind of cute as me, but he doesnt listen, hasnt learned to listen, and hasnt learned all that much about me.  He still comes home and blasts me for over an hour every day about some catalogs or puts on something like the mike meyers cat-in-the-hat movie.  That is a bad movie i dont know why its his favorite.

SO....
if theres a TLDR version of this its: why am I so goddamned ineffective?  Why cant I affect change the way I want things to go?  I cant find a way to get out of my rut and back into school because I literally crumble from shame when anyone makes fun of me for being gay.  Since I dont look it or act it, its like Im a walking pillar of vulnerability cause I cant hide my VOICE!  Side note, i love coming on reddit and reading another article about how gay voice is something im ""just doing on purpose to sound gay"".  I cant even play MMORPGs anymore because when i get to endgame and need to use voice clients I am HORRIFIED and HUMILIATED and made fun of as soon as I speak.  I wish I had cause to stop saying this but I cant: I hate being gay!  Im a 6'2"" 210lbs ogre rippling with thick musculature all over.  But Im no man, apparently they tell me.  So I cant even have gay sex; all my internalized grief ensures that I am flaccid and depressed when it comes time to get into the mood.  I havent had sex in 2 years and have no desire to consciously.  However, I know something about me isnt dead and beaten down like all he rest of me is.  And its not when i look at my boyfriend, but I want it to be (i just wish he would want to be a better guy and not such a queeny dilettante annoyingly-sassy antihero).  I feel alive when i notice a cute guy in the world.

I see a cute guy and this feeling rushes through me like I was made to be alive but for some reason am cursed to be dead.  I feel so little encouragement to be me, just only ever what people want me to be.  So few have ever cared to want to know all of me and not just stick me into a corner where I would only be able to interact with what I am given - usually to serve others.  I am a people pleaser.  

I wish I could be that guy who could bring happy feelings to people still.  I just hate feeling like im not an original.  I want to love being gay.  I feel so far from it.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;First off, I dont have one concise question.  Dont look for it.  If you are looking to solve my problems with a &amp;quot;dear abby&amp;quot; style retort, please just stop reading.  If you have some perspective to offer without telling me I need to write differently, I graciously welcome your input.  Im trying to get some stuff off my chest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do alot of things differently because I dont want to feel encircled by the spheres of influence that generally make up more socially well-rounded peoples&amp;#39; lives.  For example, I dont want a credit card because I dont like that society offers me a hand with my credit when they still think its perfectly fine to debate the nature of my existence.  I cant stand hearing about whether or not I am a real person constantly in the media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dont like going to places because people recognize me.  When they ask me what Im doing with my life its hard to tell them &amp;quot;nothing much, I have a dysfunction when it comes to giving back to society or feeling like I should work to become my best self when all around I cant even be myself.&amp;quot;  Everyone in my life just cant wait to tell me how disappointed they are that I am not a nuclear physicist by now.  Its hard to try to explain that its better than the fate I kept trying to plan for myself like putting a bullet in my skull or the one time i just let go of the wheel when i was driving my car home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But im past the worst years of my life because my sexuality has finally slowed.  If I can reach the &amp;quot;woe-is-me&amp;quot; crowd out there, all the time I spent trying to hurt myself I do actually regret because Im just now learning some tricks to self love at the age of 24.  And all I know amounts to a pathetically small view of a happy life but its what i actually have and my contributions to the people I love are enough to keep me going.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldnt ever fit into the gay molds, I cant keep up with the unwritten bodyspeak and hidden gestures that somehow make up gay interactions - suffice it to say that gay people dont often &amp;quot;get&amp;quot; me.  In fact, women seem to get me, and I am someone who isnt at all effeminate.  Not that I think its gross, by all means no, I am the gross one!  I work construction all day 6 out of 7 days.  I keep bonsai and a marine reef aquarium (which is quite a feat if you knew anything about saltwater aquariums).  I have a cat who is an amazing specimen of a creature.  I write alot but none of it is very good, like when I was a kid and filled with passion (and drugs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess my litmus test about why I am so down on life, how ive noticed that I dont consider placing myself in any sort of archetype and completely shrug off any kind of expectations for myself, is that I dont have anything to write about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ive never been to the old west, how can I write about it when all I know is from the times I spent half-watching gunsmoke or bonanza or whatever my dad had on TV?  Everything I try to come up with makes my characters sound like they are walking through a hallway.  Everything I try to paint looks boring.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dont have any desire to have an iphone.  I barely want my current phone on me all the time but the world comes to a grinding halt without it in my experience.  People go psycho when youre not constantly in contact.  I hate that.  I hate communicating in pictogram-format.  As an aside, I always thought the best form of language was using words because they express a deeper intent if you take the time to craft it.  Now my boyfriend just spends at least fifteen minutes a day griping about how he cant get his point across without little pictures of a black man holding a turd or some stupid shit like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kids that I tutor are all in ipad school apparently now.  They can barely keep their eyes focused on the things they are supposed to be learning, which somehow occupies the same brainspace as what I assume their gameboy tells them.  When I ask them what they know, its clear they have it memorized and not the foggiest clue about what it means.  Im so worried for a few of them cause they dont give a crap about school and academics used to be the only thing that kept me grounded in life.  They dont even care about taking notes, they think making squiggles under the words with an e-highlighter is good enough.  How can I get these kids shaken up and get them to appreciate the gravity of life knowing that the same forces have crushed me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the biggest set of problems I have is with my boyfriend, whom I love dearly but cannot for the life of me understand.  I always try to think - surely everyone wants to be better.  But he is so messy and I think its cause in the back of his mind he just wants me to do it all cause that will prove to him that Im finally going to be the prince charming he thinks he deserves.  I hate all the backwards fucking tricks and bullshit gay people give each other.  He cant just man the fuck up and tell me what he wants ever.  He cant shift his pride aside for even a microsecond so that I can get him to think about why he shouldnt leave old food everywhere piled on piles.  He cant get over his own bullshit pride for even a microsecond and I know this because when I am bringing something up that requires attention I see him formulating a defense in his eyes.  I see that hes completely filtering out everything I say so that he can totally derail me with a gold nugget like &amp;quot;well if you would pay for laundry service we wouldnt have this problem&amp;quot;.  Like right now I am crying at work cause I know I cant have my friends over who have flown in town to reconnect with out circles.  I cant have them over cause I am ashamed at the way our home looks and he has none.  He cant lose a single pound, he cant stop annoying me with what apple is doing every moment of every day, he cant stop telling me about what clothes hes bought (which wouldnt be so bad if I knew that it was money I was trying to get him to save so that he might actually buy cleaning supplies for me to do all the cleaning with).  I love him cause hes the same kind of cute as me, but he doesnt listen, hasnt learned to listen, and hasnt learned all that much about me.  He still comes home and blasts me for over an hour every day about some catalogs or puts on something like the mike meyers cat-in-the-hat movie.  That is a bad movie i dont know why its his favorite.&lt;/p&gt;

I haven't been able to get a date with a stable/sane guy in ages.

I think I'm attractive enough with a decent enough personality.  I mean anytime I'd go to the bar I'd have guys staring at my arms or chest and occasionally get an ass groping.  I try to smile and be friendly when talking to new people.  I just don't understand why I can't make friends and can't find dates.  It's all very frustrating.

I admit I want to buy into the fantasy of the happily ever after. I'd like to have someone redeem me and revitalize me, to help me see with new eyes. I know this is unrealistic and possibly paints me as weak, but I've always felt that I have a love-shaped hole in my heart that I can't quite fill.

I don't feel I am entitled to anything. But you can't be in my circumstances and not feel like something is out of place. Most people would consider me conventionally attractive (Aryan features with subtle Mediterranean undertones, a sturdy, well proportioned body) and an interesting personality and sense of humor, but still everybody I find or give a try ends up keeping their distance. Everyone doesn't know what they want. Dudes are scared of commitment.

All this does is force me to feed my desire for love with completely unhinged fantasies and ideals. Visions of that ""special someone"" out there clouds my judgment, and when when I do date, I unintentionally impose those standards and it becomes restrictive for the other party. It's a fucked up cycle.

I wasn't always like this. In fact for much of my earlier, boy-crazed years I was totally secure in solitariness and casualness. Now I feel I'm not getting any younger and it's itching at me to find something more substantial. 

My friends tell me my preference for younger guys undermines me, because they equate age with maturity in a fixed scale. The funny thing is the one relationship in my life where everything was like a dream involved a guy who was still a senior in high school when I was 22! Other attempts with guys more my age ended up being far more fraught. Unserious youth and whimsy counteracts my more sanguine side. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is: does anybody else feel exhausted by the pursuit of love? Is it really worth it? I hate feeling like a slave to these desires. I miss being ultra-chill about these matters, and am frankly disturbed by my apparent neediness. It might just be that my birthday is coming up and with it the usual pangs of mortality, haha. 

I'd appreciate any input from people who have had similar experiences or feelings. Thanks!

I read a few people on here saying that Grindr hurts their self confidence, they feel better without it, etc. I can understand that, as I've had some times on Grindr where I've felt really bad about myself. But, I don't know if that's Grindr or something else, since I've never known life as an adult gay male without the app. I've met some great people and had some fun experiences from Grindr, but I've also felt pretty bad about myself. (Either because people weren't responding to me, people would flake on me, I would get upset about all the guys who have ""rules"" in their profile about who is allowed to message them, or I would feel stupid about wasting hours at a time and have nothing to show for it.) I've tried deleting it in the past, but the furthest I've ever gotten is a couple weeks and then I always reinstall it because I get horny, lonely, or bored.

So anyway, I'm thinking about deleting Grindr (and possibly my other apps, although I'm not sure about deleting OKCupid. Should I delete this too?)

Wanted to hear from any of you guys who have deleted it: Do you feel better? How have you been meeting guys without it? Are you ever going to reinstall it? How do you fight the urge to reinstall?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve realized lately that most (if not all) of my time as an adult gay male, I have been actively using Grindr.
