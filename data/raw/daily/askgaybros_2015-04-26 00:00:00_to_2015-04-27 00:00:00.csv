I've recently turn 22 and I'm a complete virgin. I was raised in a religious household so I didn't experiment with anyone growing up. Since I'm away from home now, (I'm in London for study) I thought why not experiment with people here. But I'm new to these gay culture thing and I don't know what to do. So, what should I do? Should I try a get a boyfriend or just hookups? And how to do it? Like clubs? I've no idea what to do.

Thanks in advance

ps: I'm South East Asian if that of any use. And sorry if this sounds desperate. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey Gay Bros,

So about 8 months ago I was on Grindr and stumbled across a guy that was an absolute 10 in my book. Of all the time I've spent on Grindr this guy is seriously at the top in regards to looks. Anyways, I mustered up the courage to start talking with him and we hit it off. We met up a few times, had sex once, and it seemed to be going pretty well.

A month goes by and I'm starting to feel like he's losing interest. The texts are coming more often than not from me and not from him. Eventually it kind of just faded away and we stopped talking to each other. I had added him as a friend on Facebook during the time we were seeing each other but that's all that remained after we stopped talking.

Fast forward to January of this year and I met another guy who I've been seeing regularly and still currently am. He's really great and I really do enjoy spending time with him but there's one small issue, we've not discussed where we really ""stand"" in regards to a relationship. I tried to open up to him and express my feelings for him 2 months into us seeing each other and he responded that he ""thinks he has feelings for me"". Since then I've kind of just left it up to him to bring it back up. However, since January he's the only person I've been seeing and I'm the only person he's been seeing; there's just been no talk of what kind of relationship this really is (is it actually exclusive? are we boyfriends? I don't know).

Anyways, fast forward again to last night. I get a Facebook message from the 10 and he starts shooting the shit with me. Here's the main excerpt from the convo...

&gt;Ha well plenty of gay folk here that I've met thru leagues but not many I'm overly impressed with. My hand is overworked lately lol.

&gt;Hahaha, that's a bust, no luck with any of the apps either? (me)

&gt;Haha not really. Come down to [city] sometime and break my cold streak lol.

Fuck. The thought of hooking up with him again is really hot. Like **really** hot. I can seriously get off just thinking about the one time we had sex. But, I told him that I'm already seeing someone but would like to catch up with him sometime over a hike/food/something.

After writing all of this out, I guess I don't really know what my question exactly is. I'm certain I did but did I do the right thing? While part of me thinks the idea of hooking up with him again is super hot it bothers me that he's the one that stopped contact with me and now out of the blue because he can't get any he comes running back. Is that accurate? Do I need to have a conversation with my current guy to see where we really stand? This is my first ""relationship"", if that's what it really is, so any help would be appreciated. I guess I just wanted to get this off my chest and see what other people think.

tl;dr: Went out with a perfect 10 for a month but he eventually stopped contact with me.

I am 25 years old and have been doing the dating game for a while now. Writing that I had a lot of frustrating dates and disappointments will sound redundant. After having a break from dates, this week, though, I decided to download that new app called [happn](https://www.happn.fr/en/). I started talking to this guy (26 years old) on Wednesday and we immediately clicked. We decided to meet yesterday night for a late coffee at a 24 hour bakery shop. 

The date was great. He was very sweet, he made sure to pick me up at home and drive us there. We found out a bunch of coincidences, including that his best friend was my best friend during elementary school, and that we knew many people in common. He kept complimenting me on how handsome I was, what made me feel great and all. He drove me home and asked me to stay in the car with him for a while. We kissed and he spent almost one hour lying on my lap while we looked at the stars through the glass rooftop of his car. He asked to see me again tonight and I agreed. I must say that I went to bed really happy.

This morning, I woke up and he messaged me good morning. We started talking about movies and then he said he knew mine. I asked how, and then he sent me a screenshot of my Profile on Flixster. I found that really odd as I don't use it anymore and I couldn't stop thinking of how he found my profile there. I decided to ask. Then, things got a bit... weird. My first and last name are kind of unique and he said that he **GOOGLED** my full name. He found many stuff about me on Google, including that I was one of the Speakers at my High School graduation and all. I didn't confront him about it, but it made me uncomfortable and the following dialogue happened:

*Me: Why did you Google me, silly? lol*

*He: I just wanted to make sure if you were real or just a dream.*

I need your help bros.! Is this behavior socially acceptable, especially after a first date? I mean...  Is he being too clingy or am I overreacting regarding his attitude? Maybe he was just being naive and playing around as he admitted? He wants to see me tonight and I have no idea if I should consider going. Help me, bros., please!

**TL;DR:**: Finally had a great first date night. In the morning, he admits he GOOGLED my name - as it is pretty unique - and it made me very uncomfortable as he found out personal stuff about me. He wants to see me again and I don't know if I should go. Am I overreacting or is he being too clingy and not respecting the boundaries?

It was a bit of a surprise, but there weren't any issues whatsoever. I think he is a little insecure about his body, so he's chosen an incredibly narrow personality/age/religious demographic that he insists are the only guys he is attracted to.

My main problem is this, because of his insecurity issues, I think he is frustrated with his romantic life, so he talks 24/7 about his romantic desires/being gay/gay issues/gay anecdotes etc. And I don't think I can possibly overstate this. No matter what we are talking about, he will always find a way to either not-so-cleverly manipulate the conversation to make it about something gay or he will interrupt me when I'm talking to stop the conversation, and bring up a completely different topic related to being gay. That's all he'll ever talk about, and he insists on talking about it all of the time. I will get random text messages during the day, completely unsolicited, discussing his romantic desires, recent meet-ups, or anything else related to his romantic life. He goes into excruciatingly self-indulgent detail about the men he meets up with.

I try to show interest and offer advice as a friend would, but to be honest this is extremely overwhelming. It's like he's not even a real person since he came out to me, he has just become this one issue, this one thing, and it's completely consumed him. All of the things we used to talk about, art, culture, politics, have by and large completely disappeared and he primarily only discusses things that have a gay theme. I remember one absurd incident where we were discussing a play we had seen, and his first post-show comment was, ""Can you guess which character I identified with?"" - the gay one of course. Then he started to explain to me why and then we started talking about playwrighting in general as an art form, and he somehow hijacked that discussion to be about his fantasy about writing a gay play, and I kind of antagonized him for wanting to write a play about being gay just as a sort of wish-fulfillment fantasy and he realized that he really only wanted to write it because it would be erotic.

Reflexively I told her no, being gay didn't mean shit to me and I wanted to join the boy scouts. She told me that no matter what if I was gay or straight she would always love me. I got lucky with a super accepting parent. Now fast forward to the present and my mom just recently confronted me about my sexuality. She had found a letter my ex had given me that I had saved. It was basically a love letter, from my ex to me about how much he loved me blah blah. It was the first love letter I'd ever gotten so of course I saved that shit. I had asked her to find something for me in my room, came upon the letter, read it and then confronted me. Now she wasn't angry, as I prefaced, me being gay wasn't a problem for her. She was just profoundly hurt that I hadn't shared it with her, she took it as I didn't trust her enough to let her know this part about myself. Now this pissed me off beyond belief, she had read something so incredibly private, meant only for me. Just a huge invasion of my privacy, regardless I had given her permission to go through my things. Next I was even more pissed that I was expected to tell her. Yes I love and trust my mother extensively but being gay I feel is such a very small part of who I am. I envisioned myself letting her know by introducing her to the person I felt I truly loved. Who and what I love I feel defines who I am, not what arouses me sexually. I've always hated that gays are supposed to have this big coming out, where they let everyone know they're gay. I find it so fucking stupid that I'm suppose to let every know I like to fuck guys. I'm not in the closet, I don't feel any shame about my sexuality, it's just none of your fucking business what gets me off. I've never been offended by homosexual slurs because it's something that has such a small stake in who I am as a person. To me being gay is not something that defines me, what I love and what I'm passionate about does. Just like to hear how other people feel about this. I'm very open to discussion, only thing I believe in ideally is pacifism. Should I feel my sexuality defines me, am I in some way repressing how I feel about my sexuality? Is my narrow definition of what being gay is a problem? Would embracing being gay as a defining characteristic improve who I am as a person?

It was a group of 6 gay men, all from different walks of lives and ages and it was supposed to be a safe place where we just shoot the shit every Monday evening. I was the youngest there at 27 and it became a natural progression after doing individual therapy with my therapist for a year. I can see why they'd be frustrated as I admit that I do have issues with being vulnerable and talking about my personal feelings. I start venting or thinking and then I just stop myself because I think it's just so silly and nobody would want to hear me out. I'm 27, went to a good school in the West Coast and have settled in Miami Beach where I sort of fell into Real Estate. Everyone I meet says I'm a catch, but I'm still single and I'm starting to think that I might just remain single forever. My last relationship was about 3 years ago and it was to a man 20 years my senior. It some ways, he fixed me. We were together for about 8 months and I fell hard for him. My dad left when I was 7 and growing up I never really had a loving, strong male role model that I could look up to and love. It wasn't until I met my ex that I felt that unconditional love that a father might be able to provide. Of course, I didn't really look at it like that as we were also fucking, but in retrospect, he was absolutely necessary for my needing to experience that stage of childhood development, albeit belatedly. The break-up was more of a logical decision on my part since I knew I was still young, recently out and still wanted to experience the ""gay life"" whatever that means. I wanted to go out, meet people, have lots of wild sex with many different partners without feeling like I was cheating or caged in a relationship, especially with someone in a very different point in their lives. All that stuff never really happend. I have far too much self-control to really let loose sexually, especially with my fear of HIV and STD. It took a while for my emotions to catch up to what I thought was a very logical decision for my break-up, but when they did, boy was it a like a tanker trunk on my chest. I cried so much and felt so much for such a long time. I'll be lying if one of the decisions to move cross-country from CA to FL wasn't because of the break-up. After him, everything was depressing, neutral. I was numb as I thought I had opened up, really opened up to this guy, but I felt like life intervened and we were star crossed lovers destined to never really be together. In addition to the age gap, he also had a son, lived 3 hours from me and then my homophobic mother moved in with me at a point where I wasn't really ready to stand up for my sexuality and demand respect from someone who too easily spewed disgust and hate about my sexual preference. It was hard and I felt like the odds were stacked against us and that we were doomed from the very beginning. I stopped all forms of communication with him about 1 year ago, going so far as to delete my Facebook because it was an all to easy temptation to continue talking to him. I felt like I had to rip off the band-aid fast and begin the healing process, especially since I moved to a new place and I felt like I needed to give it a fair chance. Me holding on to him was already proving to be a detriment as it was far easier to talk to him on the phone or text him instead of making an effort to meet new people in my new home. Fast forward to today and I now live by myself in a comfortable 1 bedroom apartment with my dog, I've been able to push off my overbearing mother who stayed in California and I'm finally feeling like my own man and I can sense my confidence increasing. Yet, I sometimes wonder about my future and if there's ever going to be that special someone along with me for the ride. I love being alone. I retreat into my cave after too much social interaction and it's not because I don't like people, it's just that I always need some time to just recharge. I'm starting to wonder if that strong need for lots of personal space is compatible with someone in a relationship. I also value my independence and freedom to a fault. I think about a relationship and I get a bit sad thinking that a relationship is some sort of gilded cage. Other times, I take a step back and ask myself whether that line of thinking is my subconscious trying to rationalize my fear of opening up and being vulnerable by turning it into an argument where my need for independence and freedom trump any need for companionship. I honestly don't know which is right. All I know is that at this point, I'm not actively seeking a relationship, I rarely hook-up and I've met a couple guys who've I've dated and who have wanted relationships with me, but I can't seem to say yes on accounts of not being able to see myself with them, or me not able to perform in bed (see my first post http://redd.it/31p95e), or simply not feeling about them the same way. At this point, I'm at a stalemate without much indication of how to proceed. I look back at the guys that I've ended up dating and they've all made the first advance and it's become my choice to accept them or not. I've never actually chased somebody and I'm starting to wonder why that is. I want to give myself the opportunity to meet someone who I will chase for a change. In my mind, it's a healthier way to start something with someone because the choice is based on MY attraction and feelings as opposed to choosing to open the door to someone who's already knocking--whether that might be for the right reasons or not. I also still have hang-ups about my penis and about the whole top and bottom dynamic in gay relationships. I'm uncut, with a 2 inch flaccid penis that grows to a healthy 7 inches. I'm only now starting to like my penis and counter some of the embarrassment I harbored for it in it's flaccid state. In addition, I always get anxious when I'm about to top even though I want to do it very much. Before coming out in college I dated a girl and I could not get hard the night we decided to have sex. It was very traumatizing and a huge hit to my ego. That was about 8 years ago and I'm still not completely over it. I want to get to a point where I can overcome this anxiety and have healthy, loving, passionate sex where I'm the top. I'm also venting to see if you guys have any opinions that can shed light on my line of thinking when it comes to relationships and offer advice on how to negotiate my need for independence when it comes to a significant other.

Firstly, I know a huge chunk of people on here immediately advocate for jumping out of the closet as a magical solution...obviously in an ideal world with different circumstances maybe that would be realistic for me, it is not right now.

Closeted, at home for school, very very religious family.They have been silent about the topic for a while, since they had been able to isolate themselves from hearing anything about it, but now that homosexuality is more ""mainstream"" I get to hear about how they started AIDS and how never talk to one of ""them"" (be polite of course in the name of religious tolerance but remove yourself from these terrors of society). Beautiful stuff that is so much fun to hear. Been seeing a counselor because I guess I am fucked up in a lot of ways, have clinical depression...another thing to hide yay! About to lose my scholarship because my work has gone to shit.

Can't even die because that will mess up my family, and can't do that to my siblings (who are also super religious, and also suicide is against the religion too which will fuck them up more). So either I keep everything in and die a little inside all the time, or somehow get enough money and cutout my family who are the biggest part of my life (and also if I do disappear I don't want to stress them even more, my mom will probably go into shock or something and can't do that to her).

Anyone here who has survived / is currently living with a religious family and can share advice?

I fucking love our relationship, its like being with your best friend. However there is one dividing barrier between us that I fear might wreck things.

He's had a pretty busy life, he's done a lot of stuff and had loads of sex and generally been on a fair few adventures in his life. I on the other hand was a depressed muslim up until two years ago, tee-total and miserable and a virgin. This is my first ever serious relationship, he's only the second person I've ever had sex with.

My problem: I get irrationally angry when I think about this. I feel like I've missed out on some really amazing experiences whilst at university because of who I was then and who I am now. I resent my boyfriend for this. I know its completely irrational, I love him completely but for whatever reason a part of me is really annoyed when I think about all the crazy stuff he's done. 

Don't get me wrong, I love this relationship. I am not ungrateful which is why having these thoughts feels like I'm being a petulant child who just wants what he can't have. Grass is always greener and that shit, right?

Recently it's been affecting me more and more. The other night we went out for his birthday, just me and him. I took him out to dinner and then afterwards suggested we hit the town. He said he wasn't feeling it and needed to get up early in the morning. We got home and I cracked open a bottle of wine I'd been saving. He barely had a glass (don't want to get too drunk) before we had sex. 

Tonight he went out to see his friends. One of them has come back to the country so they were all meeting up. He asked me if I wanted to go but I said nah I'll let them all catch up, besides I wasn't feeling too great. He said he wouldn't stay out too late and he's only going to the pub. He rang me at 2:30am drunk telling me he's on his way home. They'd just been doing balloons at a friends house where there's always a party going on. 

I'm annoyed. Not because he's out having fun without me. That's on me. I was invited and chose not to go. I'm annoyed because he never wants to do this stuff when I'm around. He's said as much in the past when we've been at parties and he feels like he can't get shitfaced around me. I get annoyed because I feel like I'm missing out and that I'm holding him back somehow. It's all a clusterfuck. 

I don't know I'm just feeling pretty shitty and confused right now and could use some advice from someone who isn't me. Help me gaybros. I hate feeling like this.

I'm a virgin so I don't know how an actual top feels :(

I have a vibrator, dildo, and a buttplug. I started with the dildo and then I got the vibrator and buttplug just to expand my collection and try something new.

Ass play for me has been...weird? I guess that's the best way to describe it. 

The first time I tried my dildo I expected it to feel amazing. I knew I was a bottom just by my submissive attitude and I've never really wanted to fuck a guy I've just wanted to be fucked.

So I work over the course of a week this dildo into me, more and more every day. And it felt nice, but not like what I thought it would be. And I don't know why, but I kept doing it. I liked it, but I didn't know WHY I liked it. I know it was pleasurable, but I had no idea WHY it was pleasurable. It was more of a pressure, but it was a nice pressure. So I decided to get a vibrator. It comes in the mail and I am pumped.

I put the batteries in and lubed up. I turn in on to the lowest setting a press it against my ass. Oh ya, this is much better. Not even in my ass and it felt amazing, instant boner. So I push it in thinking I'm gonna start leaking. I push it in...and nothing. If anything, the pleasure dropped. I decided to power through and push it further. It's hooked at the end to hit the G Spot so I go searching for this mythical mass of nerve endings, I think I've found it before but I'm not sure if I ACTUALLY found it.

Discouraged I jack up the heat. It starts to feel better and I start rubbing my cock. And then I realize my cock is SUPER sensitive. Now this confused the hell out of me. I would understand if my cock was more sensitive if my ass felt sensitive, but I wasn't feeling much from my ass. It's like all the pleasure that was supposed to be in my ass was in my cock.

So I pull out the vibrator and try pushing it on the outside of my ass again. And BOOM. Feels fucking amazing. 

So what I gather is, teasing the outside of my ass feels amazing and I can tell the nerve endings on the outside are definitely responding correctly but as soon as I move to the inside it's my cock that gets all the pleasure. 

Is this normal?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;m doing something wrong, but I&amp;#39;ve never had huge orgasms from solo ass play. I&amp;#39;m a virgin so I don&amp;#39;t know how an actual top feels :(&lt;/p&gt;

I just met with a guy that I've seen before. We've hooked up before, but nothing penetrative. He's a top, but he's bottomed a long time ago. When we last hooked up, I was grinding on him and he really liked it, so he wanted to bottom for me the next time we met. He asked me over today, so I went over and we started fooling around. It was all good, exchanging head, me rimming him etc. Then he wanted me to fuck him, so he flipped on his stomach. I put lube on him, and attempted to finger him to loosen him up, which I do when a bottom is inexperienced. The first thing he says once I'm fingering him is ""Stop. All I can feel is your fucking nail"". I was so mortified, I started losing my erection. He just wanted me to fuck him, but I couldn't. I got on my back and we tried cowboy, but he said I wasn't fully hard. He had me jack off to try and get hard again, and I thought I was good, but apparently I was still too in my head about what happened. He tried getting on me again, and it didn't work. We tried doggy style, I couldn't get it in I was so soft. Then he gets up, and says ""You know what, we're done here"" and gives me my underwear. I'm mentally kicking myself. I say ""I'm so sorry, I guess this is goodbye"" and he says ""It's cool man"". I leave.


I'm so angry with myself right now, I feel like kicking something. I've had performance anxiety before, but it was because my MOM called my phone while we were having sex. This is different. I can't bottom because I'm so tight I get fissures. I've topped before but it's been getting progressively worse.

He ended things because he said he didn't feel as strongly as I did. Here is some context about our relationship: Things started off like this, a couple dates, then I ended contact. I think it was a mix of feeling not ready and maybe not feeling it with this person, even though we gotten along pretty well. Well after a couple months of little/no contact, I asked him out again, and then we went pretty steady since then, and formed a relationship. Things were great, but it took me forever to feel comfortable to have sex with him. When we did have sex for the first time, we barely had it after it. He even told me multiple times that he's given up on our sex life. I still felt like I loved him anyways. Fastfoward to month 5ish of our relationship, and he tells me that he doesn't feel like we are becoming a ""we."" I am concerned, and try to accommodate this, but wasn't sure how. I then begin to suffer from depression again that was at bay in the begging states of the relationship. around month 6 he tells me he needs to break up with me so i can focus on myself. I beg and plead with him, and basically an emotional wreck. I eventually convince him that I will continue to improve myself and our relationship. We see each other for a few weeks after that, and I try my hardest to change things. I had sex with him more often, I did little things for him to try to make his day. But he broke it off again a few weeks later saying he didn't have those feelings anymore, and that he felt we were friends. I was devastated, and continued with my desperation of getting him back, with begging and pleading, and whatever i could do, but this time he was set on his decision. He said that he doesn't know how things will be in the future, but right now he doesnt have those intense feelings and it would not be fair to me to keep trying. This is about 7 months in from officially being in a relationship, and about 2-3 months of ""dating""

After the break up i had time to think about how the dynamic of our relationship was. Honestly, I was trying to fill a void in myself. I was seeking self validation through someone else, and I believe why this caused our relationship to end. Since I was trying to seek something within myself, I wasn't able to fall in love properly. While he was fell in love, I was getting over the ""new relationship high"" and becoming depressed and self loathing again. When I tried to get back together with him, I felt as though I was just going through the motions to get him to validate me again, and it was not because I felt good being with him. I had a conversation with him about these topics, and he said that it makes a lot of sense to him. We agreed that we will meet up again to build closure after I have time to find this part of me that i'm missing 
The thing is, i feel like i really missed an opportunity with a great guy. I don't think I felt love with him because I was caught up in myself the majority of the time i was with him, but there was times I generally felt like i was with the person i was suppose to be with. I have a lot of feelings around this breakup, but I miss him terribly and wish things were different, and that i could have developed further along.  I'm hoping that he may be open to trying again once I figure things out.
