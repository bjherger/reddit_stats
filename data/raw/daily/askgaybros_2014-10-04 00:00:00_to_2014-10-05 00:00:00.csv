Ive been dating my boyfriend for a year and a half.  Hes a year younger than (22, 23) and a senior in college.  I graduated in the spring of 2013 (relevant later).  He told me last night that he wanted to take a break in our relationship.  He suffers from depression and other issues from when he was a child and recently started seeing a therapist.  This has caused him to be very distant and emotional saying it's bringing up feelings from when he was younger and has to work through them.  About a year ago, he had a crisis where he thought being in a LTR relationship was causing him to miss out on the college experience and we tried an open relationship.  It was ok, and ended after a month when he realized that what we had was special.  He said to me last night that he needs his space to get his head right and that he feels like he is missing the college experience by not being able to go out to a party and make out with a guy and not feel bad.  We have galked about moving in together.  He recently took a trip to san diego and realized how much he hates the current city that we live in and doesnt want to stay here, even though its one of the best cities for his industry.  He also is doubting his major and doesn't know if he wants to continue it.  I dont know what to do or tell him, hes the love of my life and I cant imagine not having in my life.

Background 1:  I'm a fraternal twin.  I'm gay, my brother isn't.  We were always touchy-feely-huggy above the belt.  Then 20 years ago he moved across the country for a job.  Haven't been face to face with him since.

Background 2:  I have a wonderful neighbor, we get along like brothers.  He's a whoredog, a different woman every night, tho he does recycle occasionally. :)  Over the years we've talked, he's uncut, doesn't like the idea of anything anal, knows I'm a total bottom.  He hugs me on occasion, tolerates my incessant teasing about kissing him.  Once we held hands just to tease the other neighbors.  We agreed long ago that nothing would ever happen below the belt.

3:  A few of his women friends, particularly this one lesbian, have been urging him to let me suck him off (this was done without my knowledge or consent), and while he laughs about it, I can hear tension in his voice.

The Issue:  Recently he went through a very difficult legal ordeal brought on by one of his ex-girls who went psycho.  He was terrified, and we spent many a summer night in our underwear just trying to keep it together.  Durin that period we did a lot of hugging and holding, even spooned each other (taking turns at big spoon).

When the ordeal was over, we went back to the occasional hug, but I can feel resistance in him.  Seriously, I want nothing below the belt with this guy, but I really miss the genuine hugs, and I admit the spooning, too.  I haven't had a chance to discuss this with him, and honestly, don't know that I would have the courage to do that.  So here it is 2am and all I can think about is falling asleep in his arms.

I'm gay, he's not, I'm a twin, he's not, I miss his hugging and spooning, not caring about playing below the belt.

I'm very much not out.  Spring 2013 I discovered Grindr and soon after, I started chatting with this guy.  He claimed he's also not out.  We never exchanged face pics, but some sexting was involved (this is kind of embarrassing to admit).  We met twice, both times in a very public place, both times in a town about half an hour away from where I live, just talking.  I didn't feel him, so I said it wasn't gonna go any further than just chatting on grindr.  He said he would be deleting his grindr account but wanted us to be friends at least.  He even gave me his phone number, but I never used it.  He seemed kind of infatuated with me to the point of being clingy, so I thought it'd be best to leave it be.  It was kind of a big ""break up"".  

This all happened in a span of a couple months.  After that I hadn't heard from him and didn't try to contact him or anything.  I'd changed phones so I lost his original grindr account.  A few months later I was out in a coffee shop with some friends, and whom do I see walking by?  This guy.  We obviously recognized each other.  He casually went by a second time.  But nobody said anything to the other, and I think he left soon after.  I thought it was kind of strange that he was even there since he said he lived in another town about half an hour away.  But you know, coincidences happen.

A couple months ago, I start getting messages from a mostly blank profile.  Nothing out of the ordinary.  Asking me for pics, what I'm looking for, etc.  He even sent me his location.  I didn't give him anything because he didn't offer anything first, but I engaged in a polite conversation with him a couple times.  I didn't think anything of it.  

A couple weeks ago, I get a message from this profile again asking me if I was still working at the same company.  I was kind of taken aback, like how would you know what I work for (not the specific place but the type of place).  He then starts asking some other questions that suggest he knows me.  But it wasn't until he mentioned the coffee shop that it clicked that this is the same guy.  So at first I was like, oh hey, long time no talk, blah blah blah.  He says he's thought about me.  He keeps repeating that he wouldn't say hi to me in public because he would never out me, etc.  My alarm bells go off, and I don't know if it reflected in my conversation with him, but he keeps asking if he's not bothering me, etc.  This is something that I had thought about him initially, that he's a people pleaser so he wants to make sure he's not a bother to you.

Since then he's mentioned to me things about my working hours - like how long I stay on certain days, whether I'm in the office at a certain time, etc.  I try not to read too much into it.  The other day he tells me he knows where I work and gives me a street name that's not far from it.  Now I'm really concerned.  I act like it's no big deal, ask him how he knows, he says he was in the area and saw me.  Again?  He's now seen me at least twice, in a town that he claims he doesn't live.  Yet again he repeats that he would never out me.

At this point I'm kind of paranoid about the whole thing.  I try not to show him because I don't want him to think he has something over me.  I mean, honestly, even if he outs me, it's not the end of the world.  But at this point his behavior seems like that of a stalker.  I don't know if he realizes he'd tried talking to me before and even gave me a location.  I looked into the location, but couldn't find much.  I continue to be nice and pleasant to him as I contemplate what my next move should be.  I'm afraid that if I tell him to stop and cut him off (block him) he could get offended and try to pull something. How do I try to get out of this without triggering anything like that?  Or maybe I'm just being paranoid and reading too much into this whole thing.

Here's how it went down, I got a text from a dating app from this guy and we talked for awhile. We decided to meet in person and I was having a really great time conversing with someone, I had been in a near state of isolation for weeks even though I'm in college. I couldn't remember the last time I had a good conversation with someone, I have a counselor but I only see her once a week.

When it was over I just wanted to stay with him but his mood turned sort of dark and he told me that I had to go. I was really upset that night and couldn't sleep at all, it kind of fucked up my entire week from thinking about it so much. I hate to be that desperate clingy guy so I've only sent him one message since then asking if he wanted to hang out again, I waited for a response all through the night and eventually gave up. I haven't let this affect my life to a major degree but my brain definitely feels clouded. Why am I waiting for a message when I'm not sure if I want to have sex again? I just want to be blunt and ask him what he really thinks about me. I'd rather be hurt than feel nothing at all, at least it would help me move on if wasn't interested in seeing me again. I don't think the NSA approach was a good idea, I might even be in love with this guy, fuck. The song ""I want the one I can't have"" by the Smiths embodies how I feel right now.

I thought he was the conservative, ""adam-&amp;-eve-not-adam-&amp;-steve"" type of guy, so at first I kept my distances.

Turns out he's actually pretty cool, and he's been confiding about his struggles with a recent break-up.

So while on the topic he asks me if I'm dating someone; I've been out for so long I'm actually over/beyond the whole proclamation each time, and just talk about it when it comes up or I get asked.
I comment on dudes and stuff, so it's not that hard to put 2 and 2 together, but still, the guy clearly wanted to approach it in the most sensible way possible.

I tell him ""I've been with a guy for 3 years"", and he's so gobsmacked; I mean fair enough, 3 years is a pretty big deal at 24, but he's my same age and had the same gf for 8 years. 

His reaction made me think: is it still so unheard of of gay guys who are in a committed relationship?
Is his reaction a byproduct of the (stereo)typical portrayal of gay men as promiscuous man-eaters, or was he simply caught off-guard by my NBD attitude towards my sexuality?

We will get tested tomorrow.

We got to talking and we connected very well. He's 600 miles away so obviously we can't hang out and talk but he said he wished someone like me lived closer because he is really lonely. I feel the same way too so I understand where he's coming from when he explained why.


His and my problem is that we and both really really shy. He used to be small and skinny and is insecure about that and still thinks like he used to when he was small. I am insecure about being smaller as well and am highly insecure about my appearance. We both like the same type of guy and know that the bigger, muscular bearish type guys don't generally go for us because we are both young (though he is a muscle bear). He and I have both been told that we come off as self centered and conceited at clubs because we go and stand there and not really talk to anybody. He is ""intimidatingly attractive"" where people are afraid to approach him because they are afraid of being rejected. We both would rather walk barefoot on broken glass instead of approach someone because we are  that shy and insecure. Because we don't talk to anybody and don't outwardly express emotion much (both INTJ personalities), people just assume we think we are better than them. We both turn to the apps because it makes it so that we don't have to deal eith the anxiety of physically going up to someone and people will feel more comfortable talking to use when we are just pictures.


So I'm asking for your help for both of us. I know exactly how he feels and I want to help him and myself out because it's not fun. What can we do to become less why and more confident about our appearances without really changing who we are to ""fit in""?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I messeged this guy on scruff who is a 10/10 and hands down the most gorgeous person I&amp;#39;ve seen in a while. We got to talking and we connected very well. He&amp;#39;s 600 miles away so obviously we can&amp;#39;t hang out and talk but he said he wished someone like me lived closer because he is really lonely. I feel the same way too so I understand where he&amp;#39;s coming from when he explained why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His and my problem is that we and both really really shy. He used to be small and skinny and is insecure about that and still thinks like he used to when he was small. I am insecure about being smaller as well and am highly insecure about my appearance. We both like the same type of guy and know that the bigger, muscular bearish type guys don&amp;#39;t generally go for us because we are both young (though he is a muscle bear). He and I have both been told that we come off as self centered and conceited at clubs because we go and stand there and not really talk to anybody. He is &amp;quot;intimidatingly attractive&amp;quot; where people are afraid to approach him because they are afraid of being rejected. We both would rather walk barefoot on broken glass instead of approach someone because we are  that shy and insecure. Because we don&amp;#39;t talk to anybody and don&amp;#39;t outwardly express emotion much (both INTJ personalities), people just assume we think we are better than them. We both turn to the apps because it makes it so that we don&amp;#39;t have to deal eith the anxiety of physically going up to someone and people will feel more comfortable talking to use when we are just pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
