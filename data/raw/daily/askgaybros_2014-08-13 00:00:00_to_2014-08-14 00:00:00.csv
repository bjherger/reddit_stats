Not depressed, not anxious, but confused. 
I've (28M) been with my boyfriend/partner (boyfartner; 42M) for almost 4 years. He's my first serious boyfriend in the States. I worked retail mgmt after college (after getting a BA in Spanish and French) because I maintained (and still maintain) this dream of being a writer, and used my spare time to do that. I always knew I anticipated going to grad school, and when we got together when I was 24, I was starting to put my feelers out about it (that was in late 2010, and I graduated in 2009). 

During the first year of our relationship I worked at a steady job, declined a promotion with the company that would require relocating, partied a lot with my BF and started preparing to go back to school; I made the choice then to stay in my home town (PDX, went to school elsewhere and studied abroad, but came back after college) because of my family and my boyfriend; I met my BF when I was 18 (yeah, I know, do the math) but wasn't ready to go back to being single again. I realized I didn't want to move away for grad school as it would be too expensive with loans and everything, and my job situation was untenable. I also realized I wanted to switch out of retail and chose to get into finance and accounting. At the beginning of 2012, I went back to school and switched jobs, both full time. I started prepping for my master's degree program and was slated to start in fall of 2013. 

From the beginning of 2012, to September of 2013, I ended up getting wasted and cheating on my BF (and told him immediately), my drinking started getting really out of hand and my anxiety and depression started getting really bad after struggling with them since my teens. During the summer of 2013, immediately prior to starting my program and almost a year after my cheating, I basically had a breakdown and started freaking out about everything in my life, and started to see a therapist, who probably saved my life. 

I'm being treated for my mild depression and severe anxiety now, and I've been sober almost a year. And that's where the problem comes in. 
I love my boyfartner a lot. A lot a lot. Our relationship has a lot of problems, but so do a lot of them. We get along really really well and don't fight much anymore. I know this is because I am crawling out of my pit of alcoholism and depression/severe anxiety. I feel like I'm going through all the growing up I should have been doing the past 10 years in a very short time frame. 
And I think that's the problem. My boyfartner and I have a lot of common interests. We love traveling. We love tech. We get along really well. Neither of us is interested in drugs and he doesn't drink much. We're homebodies and that's okay. We have similar family backgrounds. We like similar food and we have similar senses of humor.  I could go on, but won't. 

And at the same time, I'm realizing we have a lot of differences, things I knew about but always thought I could over look. However, now that I don't have chemicals to cope with these things or blank them out (and that's good), I find I feel icky inside overlooking them. I don't like TV or movies; he lives for them. I read voraciously and write; his literature collection is his stack of Rolling Stone (not to knock it, but that's all he reads- and that inconsistently). He doesn't have a lot of empathy and he has a real problem understanding how other people think. He is also pretty insensitive and struggles to understand why and how others get upset at him, given that he struggles to understand when the thoughts and feelings of others differ from his. He is extremely private and almost ""fearful"" of others and the world; we live in the suburbs and he won't interact with the neighbors, he won't participate in our HOA or even answer the door if the doorbell rings and he's not expecting visitors. He's told me numerous times that ""the only way to get things done is to do it yourself because you can't trust anyone."" He hates leading and making decisions and doing anything at all to draw attention to himself; it's always head down, mouth shut. Needless to say, holding my hand or public affection is 100% out of the question. 

I am finding myself increasingly the opposite. I try to help people and do the right thing, and that's really important to me. I try really hard not to expose myself to huge swathes of pop culture because it just infuriates me; I am very driven, and like to get up early, to have new experiences, try new things, explore and engage in my community. 
Lastly, our sex life is basically DOA from boredom, my hectic schedule and the fact that oops, I'm not a bottom (and realized it a bit late). 

Now, to up the ante, he is now planning on moving in the next year and it's more or less a given that I'll go with. He wants another house in the suburbs to hide away in like we do here, venturing out into the city for adventures and then coming back here to our relative isolation. I don't want a house; I don't want the space, I don't want to fill it with ""stuff"" when I could use the money on adventures and experiences, I don't want to continue living in isolation from my neighbors because my partner doesn't believe in interacting with them. This whole house hunting exercise is making me realize that in these really critical ways we're on opposite sides of the coin. But at the same time, I still really, really love him and want to be with him, and am confident we can find work around for this shit. 
Finally, I feel guilty about breaking up with him because I feel like I've wasted his time and money. 
The question: what do I do? What's the right thing? Should I feel guilty for part of me wanting to break up? I love our companionship; is that enough to keep a relationship together? 
I've talked to my therapist about it, but it's a bit hard as she's not a gay man. 

Wow, I'm a fuckin' whiner.

&lt;p&gt;During the first year of our relationship I worked at a steady job, declined a promotion with the company that would require relocating, partied a lot with my BF and started preparing to go back to school; I made the choice then to stay in my home town (PDX, went to school elsewhere and studied abroad, but came back after college) because of my family and my boyfriend; I met my BF when I was 18 (yeah, I know, do the math) but wasn&amp;#39;t ready to go back to being single again. I realized I didn&amp;#39;t want to move away for grad school as it would be too expensive with loans and everything, and my job situation was untenable. I also realized I wanted to switch out of retail and chose to get into finance and accounting. At the beginning of 2012, I went back to school and switched jobs, both full time. I started prepping for my master&amp;#39;s degree program and was slated to start in fall of 2013. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the beginning of 2012, to September of 2013, I ended up getting wasted and cheating on my BF (and told him immediately), my drinking started getting really out of hand and my anxiety and depression started getting really bad after struggling with them since my teens. During the summer of 2013, immediately prior to starting my program and almost a year after my cheating, I basically had a breakdown and started freaking out about everything in my life, and started to see a therapist, who probably saved my life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m being treated for my mild depression and severe anxiety now, and I&amp;#39;ve been sober almost a year. And that&amp;#39;s where the problem comes in. 
I love my boyfartner a lot. A lot a lot. Our relationship has a lot of problems, but so do a lot of them. We get along really really well and don&amp;#39;t fight much anymore. I know this is because I am crawling out of my pit of alcoholism and depression/severe anxiety. I feel like I&amp;#39;m going through all the growing up I should have been doing the past 10 years in a very short time frame. 
And I think that&amp;#39;s the problem. My boyfartner and I have a lot of common interests. We love traveling. We love tech. We get along really well. Neither of us is interested in drugs and he doesn&amp;#39;t drink much. We&amp;#39;re homebodies and that&amp;#39;s okay. We have similar family backgrounds. We like similar food and we have similar senses of humor.  I could go on, but won&amp;#39;t. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And at the same time, I&amp;#39;m realizing we have a lot of differences, things I knew about but always thought I could over look. However, now that I don&amp;#39;t have chemicals to cope with these things or blank them out (and that&amp;#39;s good), I find I feel icky inside overlooking them. I don&amp;#39;t like TV or movies; he lives for them. I read voraciously and write; his literature collection is his stack of Rolling Stone (not to knock it, but that&amp;#39;s all he reads- and that inconsistently). He doesn&amp;#39;t have a lot of empathy and he has a real problem understanding how other people think. He is also pretty insensitive and struggles to understand why and how others get upset at him, given that he struggles to understand when the thoughts and feelings of others differ from his. He is extremely private and almost &amp;quot;fearful&amp;quot; of others and the world; we live in the suburbs and he won&amp;#39;t interact with the neighbors, he won&amp;#39;t participate in our HOA or even answer the door if the doorbell rings and he&amp;#39;s not expecting visitors. He&amp;#39;s told me numerous times that &amp;quot;the only way to get things done is to do it yourself because you can&amp;#39;t trust anyone.&amp;quot; He hates leading and making decisions and doing anything at all to draw attention to himself; it&amp;#39;s always head down, mouth shut. Needless to say, holding my hand or public affection is 100% out of the question. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am finding myself increasingly the opposite. I try to help people and do the right thing, and that&amp;#39;s really important to me. I try really hard not to expose myself to huge swathes of pop culture because it just infuriates me; I am very driven, and like to get up early, to have new experiences, try new things, explore and engage in my community. 
Lastly, our sex life is basically DOA from boredom, my hectic schedule and the fact that oops, I&amp;#39;m not a bottom (and realized it a bit late). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, to up the ante, he is now planning on moving in the next year and it&amp;#39;s more or less a given that I&amp;#39;ll go with. He wants another house in the suburbs to hide away in like we do here, venturing out into the city for adventures and then coming back here to our relative isolation. I don&amp;#39;t want a house; I don&amp;#39;t want the space, I don&amp;#39;t want to fill it with &amp;quot;stuff&amp;quot; when I could use the money on adventures and experiences, I don&amp;#39;t want to continue living in isolation from my neighbors because my partner doesn&amp;#39;t believe in interacting with them. This whole house hunting exercise is making me realize that in these really critical ways we&amp;#39;re on opposite sides of the coin. But at the same time, I still really, really love him and want to be with him, and am confident we can find work around for this shit. 
Finally, I feel guilty about breaking up with him because I feel like I&amp;#39;ve wasted his time and money. 
The question: what do I do? What&amp;#39;s the right thing? Should I feel guilty for part of me wanting to break up? I love our companionship; is that enough to keep a relationship together? 
I&amp;#39;ve talked to my therapist about it, but it&amp;#39;s a bit hard as she&amp;#39;s not a gay man. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow, I&amp;#39;m a fuckin&amp;#39; whiner. 
Edit: paragraphs!&lt;/p&gt;

I wasn't really looking for much from the app. I matched with him, and we've been talking ever since. This was in late June. We both live in Cali, but we're two hours apart from eachother. I'm heading into my senior year, and so is he. We both would like to move out of Cali when we graduate. We have eerily similar goals in our life about travel, about family, and about most things. Hell, we even have the same ethnicity and extended family size (Both middle eastern, both have 30 cousins). It's almost creepy. But we're different enough to be interesting to eachother, which is awesome.

Texting and chatting on the phone, I was interested. However, he recently made a day trip to my city. We hung out all day, got lunch, went on a walk, watched a movie, and cuddled/made out for a good 3 hours. No sex. Nothing dirty. We both said we respected eachother too much and wanted to get to know eachother more before doing anything intimate like that. When time came for him to leave, we literally just hugged for 5 minutes. It wasn't awkward at all. (which is weird, because I don't think I've ever hugged someone for a minute straight, let alone 5) It was just right. 

I've never felt this way about a guy. Ever. I've only been in 3 real relationships, but I've dated probably 15 other guys in my life. (I'm 22) **Never in my life have I felt so strongly for one person, and that scares the shit out of me.** The past 6 months or so, I've been all ""I'm gonna be single and just be by myself for my senior year. No boyfriends, just me."" I was *VERY* adamant about that, and I truly was loving the single life. Then all this happened. 

We've talked about what we want to do, and we both agree to just keep things going as they are and see what happens. The problem is we're both very busy people, especially during the school year. Finding time would be hard. It wouldn't be impossible, but we'd have to work on it. He's never been in a relationship before (23 yrs old), never gone all the way with a guy either. That doesn't really worry me though. So here's what I need help with:

- He's on the fence about distance. He said he doesn't know if he has the personality for it, but he's not certain. He's told me in person that he doesn't want to say he can't be in a distance relationship because with the right guy, it could work. But what do I do? The longer we keep talking, the more interested I get and the more I want to be with him.
This isn't a one sided thing. We talk everyday. He'll initiate conversations, plan dates, flirt, and do everything like that. I'll do it all too. This means he's  

- I am terrified for feeling like this. Honestly, and this is completely bonkers, but I can see myself with this guy for the long haul. I don't know what it is. It just clicks. Our sense of humor, how easy it is to talk, future plans, physical attraction, it's all there. This terrifies me though cause I don't want to set myself up for disappointment. How the hell do I approach this...

I very recently started seeing a guy, who is very obviously older than me. I'm 26, this guy seems mid-late 30's, I haven't asked him his exact age yet because I don't want to seem rude. Until recently I had serious self-confidence issues and had several struggles with depression, finally I felt that I was comfortable enough in my own skin to do a relationship justice: before then I grudgingly accepted I would be *'forever alone'*.

Another reason that I haven't tried before now to get any kind of boyfriend is due to being pretty afraid of sex, due to an unfortunate incident in my childhood, which I don't want to go into here, which again I'm starting to get over now, but didn't want to go in at the deep end with for obvious reasons.

Anyway, we were introduced by mutual friends and we both share similar interests and personalities. He's kinda 'sweet' (even though I do kind of hate that word), and is totally fine with going slow and steady. He also mentioned he's in a bit of a dry spell as well after he had an ex cheat on him and break his heart.

I am 100% certain he's a genuine guy who won't do any shady shit, I trust both my friends and him after spending time with him.

I don't know why it should be such a sticking point, even if he's 38 he's still within the 'acceptable dating range' for me, and I feel disappointed in myself for being so shallow, and even though I've been able to finally say ""I'm happy with myself and don't care what others think"" when it comes to my own life and tastes I find myself plagued with thoughts of what others might think, which in turn makes me doubt if I'm truly ready for a relationship yet.

I don't know if I'm also scared of a long term commitment so early on, but as I said before, I kind of have no other choice if I don't want to start off cruising.

I do like the guy and I don't want to hurt him, and a significant part of me does really want to try, but this doubt is maddening. We've got a date tomorrow, I would appreciate any advice on how I can get over this.

Edit: Forgot to say (and I don't know how relevant this will be) but both of us are very straight acting, so it feels like something of a minor miracle we got together in the first place.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi, I&amp;#39;d like to first apologise for using a throwaway, but there are a few things that I plan to say here that I don&amp;#39;t want to be tied to my main account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know why it should be such a sticking point, even if he&amp;#39;s 38 he&amp;#39;s still within the &amp;#39;acceptable dating range&amp;#39; for me, and I feel disappointed in myself for being so shallow, and even though I&amp;#39;ve been able to finally say &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m happy with myself and don&amp;#39;t care what others think&amp;quot; when it comes to my own life and tastes I find myself plagued with thoughts of what others might think, which in turn makes me doubt if I&amp;#39;m truly ready for a relationship yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;m also scared of a long term commitment so early on, but as I said before, I kind of have no other choice if I don&amp;#39;t want to start off cruising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do like the guy and I don&amp;#39;t want to hurt him, and a significant part of me does really want to try, but this doubt is maddening. We&amp;#39;ve got a date tomorrow, I would appreciate any advice on how I can get over this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Forgot to say (and I don&amp;#39;t know how relevant this will be) but both of us are very straight acting, so it feels like something of a minor miracle we got together in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

I can't believe I am asking this because it seems so silly and makes me feel desperate, but anyway I like to go on Omegle sometimes. A lot of times to talk and meet people, sometimes for fun. This particular guy we had some quick fun where we basically complimented each other and uh showed off. Then he had to go, but we added each other on FB.

It's been about a month and we didn't message each other, but he messaged me last night talking a bit and he asked when I'm coming to see him. He's from Brazil and uh pretty hot, but is in the US for school for a year or so. I joked and told him to come where I live and he sort of said that would be fun, but no money.

I'm kind of entertaining the idea of paying for his ticket or part of it. But I also don't really know the guy. I'm pretty positive there would be (lots) of sex involved, but lots of just fun things to do here and it would be nice to have someone to do all of that with. I would also of course ask him to get tested before messing around because I am really paranoid about that stuff.

Would any of you actually do this? He's younger than me since he's still in college and I am not, but not a huge age gap if I remember. I think he's 21-22. I just don't get why he would be willing to do that. He acts like I am so perfect for him and whatever but we have barely talked. We played around on Omegle briefly and that was it haha. So you can understand why I am hesitant, besides the fact that I feel so ridiculous desperate for even considering this.
