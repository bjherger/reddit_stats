Long time browser, first post on Reddit. Sorry for any errors... 

I am thinking about going to a psychologist sometime next month to discuss depression. I've been having trouble coming out and I want to talk to someone about it because it's making me really upset and tired all of the time (having trouble sleeping, keep thinking and thinking and then finally after a couple of hours I fall asleep only to wake up 6 hours later). I am worried about anti depressants coming up as an option to help cope with it. 

Has anyone here ever taken them? Do they actually help? I know most cases vary but some advice would be appreciated. :)

EDIT: Thanks for the advice everyone. Will be speaking to the psychologist or psychiatrist about other options before taking them. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey, &lt;/p&gt;

Like really hard, not only because the fact I'm gay but also because of some personal, familiar and economical situations so I wanted to ask for some advice...

I'm 20. I have never kissed anyone in my life, I have not dated anyone whatsoever or at least known of another person that likes me back. That's kinda crappy, I mean I consider myself a good person, average good looking and I'm very hard-working but no one seems to be interested in me and any attempt of mine to get to know someone just ends bad.
I have been in love once, and it was horrible. I loved this guy for one year and a half I mean I cared about him I got nervous whenever he was close but he was really rude at me and turned out that he is straight so... you can figure out the rest of the story. Well and the other guys I have liked were also straight or jerks (or both)... that makes me feel sad and lonely. Specially because I got almost no one to share it with, I just have a couple of friends that know I'm gay and it is not because I don't accept it, but because where I live being gay seems to be so wrong and dangerous... If I told my other friends they would stop helping me and talking to me at all... even my parents would kick me out...

I don't know what else to say... I feel lonely and kinda desperate and I'm writing this to get some advice. Thanks.

I've grown up in a loving environment and it always felt natural for me to want.. somebody. I have friends I love, but it's not the same.

Unfortunately, life isn't all sunshine and butterflies. I've been told to not look for love, it'll happens, etc. Partly right. But the truth is, I had badlucks on both side of the coin and there are shitty guys everywhere so... First love experience, manipulating jerk, met randomly at college, second one, he had way too high expectations so he left me and went somewhere else. 

ANYWAY. The thing I've always found funny about me is the fact my libido is as big as my heart... Which is the issues. With all my attempts obtaining something worth mentioning, both online, friends' friends, school, jobs, etc., I sorta gave up on some standards. I've yet to meet a guy with whom I have real and honest potentials, and I have a big social life.
 Before (like a year and a half ago), I was avoiding sex outside relationships as much as I could because that's not what I wanted, but it ended driving me crazy and more depressive than else, especially when just holding hands make me happy.

So I started to be more open about the idea of random one nights... At first (after doing nothing for a whole year and a couple of months) it was amazing, but now, with in general two guys per month this summer, I feel like I ruined something. I'm still horny, but I feel so messed-up. I don't seek sex (as in, I don't go online asking for sex), opportunities just show up in my life sometime, and although I'm physically aroused, I feel mentally jaded. Like ""Well, another one... *sigh*""... And if an opportunity shows up, it's like if I just don't care enough anymore about all of this to say no because of ""some irrational standards"" I once gave myself. So I just go ahead and a take it, and feel even more jaded afterward because, well, guys are predictable in general lol. 

A good example would be when I go on a date with a guy with the intention of starting to see him. Then the guy starts being all touchy horny out of the blue... Yet, it's as if I didn't have the will or the strength to just say no because part of me is aroused anyway and I'm like ""well, whatever..."", so I go ahead. The guy never writes back (obviously), and I'm back to being jaded.

I feel like I ruined some kind of magic or ""special feeling"" when you have sex. It's weird. I'm having a good time with the guy, but mentally, when he leaves, it just makes me feel like ""Been there done that"". All the guys I speak to, even in my insistence to find someone good, feel uninteresting or too similar to the others or they stop showing interest, just like everybody else.

In other words, I'm jaded. I don't even have the energy to 'resist' to my own body needs anymore, I'm tired.

Bisexual here, looking to make some friends with some other bros around the GTA. I am 21 currently attending UofT. Hoping to make a good friend who is chill (not dramatic) and interested in exploring different parts of the city with me. Out of experience the flamboyant guy friends I have met have been hard to get along with, so i do honestly prefer more masculine friends.

A bit about me:
Eastern European - take great pride in my culture/people

Hoping to go into Human Rights Law  aka very interested in politics

Game of Thrones, House of Cards, Law and Order, Parks and Rec, etc

Love swimming and jogging, not very big into going to the gym - but hoping to begin with a friend

Messages welcome :)

Out of experience the flamboyant guy friends I have met have been hard to get along with, so i do honestly prefer more masculine friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bit about me:
Eastern European - take great pride in my culture/people&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hoping to go into Human Rights Law  aka very interested in politics&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Game of Thrones, House of Cards, Law and Order, Parks and Rec, etc&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Love swimming and jogging, not very big into going to the gym - but hoping to begin with a friend&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Messages welcome :)&lt;/p&gt;

Is there a seminal moment or is all gradations?

____

I met a great guy about two months ago. We've loosely agreed that we're dating and open to see how it develops. We've spent most of our free time together since, so it's obvious neither of us is seeing anyone someone else. Saturday night, I got blackout plastered and apparently came on to a friend (who is also in a relationship). I don't remember this, neither does the guy I'm dating, who was present the whole night. I kind of think my friend is just teasing me for being a mess that night. But, it still got me thinking.

I haven't been in love before. I'm not a love at first sight kind of guy, and I don't get much out of romantic gestures. I figured love would just happen eventually if I met a guy I was interested in and invested time. And this guy is interesting. I find him sexually attractive; he's made me late to work a number of times. I have a great time when we're not doing sexual things too. His intelligence and open mind coupled with his different perspectives make for awesome conversations. We're both more inclined to last minute plans, and actually pull through. He can get into politics and stuff. He's okay with me not being as religious; I think it's endearing that he is. He came with me to my electronic concerts even though he is more into country and rock (and had a good time). He gets on with the friends I've introduced him to - it's great. Zero red flags. Well, my mom will comment if she finds out about his NRA membership, but... that's not something I personally care about.

Still, at this point it doesn't really feel different from a friendship (with sex). I like him. And I've told him so. But I don't think I love him. Am I wrong to expect irrational/emotional thoughts? Am I just over-thinking this?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TL:DR;&lt;/em&gt; I know there isn&amp;#39;t one answer to this, but how long into a relationship are you when start falling in love?
