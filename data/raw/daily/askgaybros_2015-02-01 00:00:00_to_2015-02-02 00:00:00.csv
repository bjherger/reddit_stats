I actually had previously asked if he would install it and he said ""sure.""  Today when I asked, he refused to do it and we got into a huge argument. He told me that it was a trust issue and it means that I don't trust him.  I told him it was just something cool to have so I could check in and see where he was at without calling. He told me that he doesn't believe in things like that because it decreases real communication and I should just call to ask where he is at. I told him that he doesn't trust me because he doesn't believe me when I am telling him that I don't want it to try to catch him doing something and that we would still have to trust each other regardless of whether or not the app is installed. I didn't expect him to say no so I started thinking that maybe he really is hiding something because his reasons didn't make sense to me. Why would you not install an app on your phone for me? We have talked about moving in together and I told him that he should keep his apartment until he can trust me that the reason I don't want the app is just so I can try to catch him doing something. We even both mentioned breaking up if the other wouldn't give in. He FINALLY agreed to do it and after he did I told him that we could delete it if he wants to when he gets home  because now I know that he is being honest and that I really just wanted the app because it was cool and not to spy on him every day so I will delete it if it makes you think I don't trust you. We both said we were sorry and talked about how much we love each other.  

Am I crazy here? Should I really agree to delete it tomorrow? Do you believe his reasoning for not wanting the app? I really love this guy and want to be with him but this raised a red flag for me. Thanks for any advice you can give. 






**UPDATE:**  We just talked and he is not breaking up with me. He gets my side and I get his now.  It was more of a privacy issue for him that made him feel uneasy.  I just wish he would have communicated that better last night instead of giving the reason that it is solely because I don't trust him. I'm thinking he thought that reason would make me think he was hiding something so he didn't explain himself fully. You guys have made me realize how sensitive this issue is for most people. Apparently, I see it differently than most and had a hard time understanding. I have been dishonest in past relationships and have given the same reasons all of you gave below for not wanting to be tracked. This relationship is special and I feel like I could marry this guy.

One of my housemates is gay  and has been hitting on me for a long time. Recently when he did this I figured why not? It would chill him out and for all I know it might be great.
I asked him what he would even want to do and told him I'd think about it.

He said he wants me to come home from work one night and he'll massage/rim/blow me. I've never been with a bloke or been rimmed before and I was wondering if doing this would give me a risk of disease or anything, I'm not really sure.

I've met everyone else through random events, and I'm just getting sick of being alone. 

Also does anyone know how to get Grindr on a Blackberry Q10? The Blackberry download isn't compatible with my phone. I know Grindr sucks but I just want somebody.

Every other site I'm on isn't as active as others. Gaydar sucks, OkCupid sucks.

So though I'm open to suggestions, I'm wondering what people in Toronto do? Like average guys in Toronto or other cities.

I'm in the outer city area so I'm not able to go to ""bars"" at a whim and have to use the computer to meet people, 2,000 people live in my town/.

I already added myself to the bromap and I was the only dot within like 45 km, so it's not the greatest way.

Is it just because there are so little gay people in general that I'm having a problem, or could it just be I don't know about other methods.

I don't want a hookup, I did that throughout highschool and really do not care for it anymore, obviously casual hook-up if I hung out with someone is fine, but I don't like the ""come fuck me"" shit that is involved with a lot of apps and chat sites, I feel like those people are mentally unstable for some reason haha.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know this is the most common question, but how do people from the Toronto area; or even the outer GTA, and other metro areas meet people?&lt;/p&gt;

If it's off-topic and/or worthy of being deleted, then so be it, and I apologize.

So I live in a 3-person apartment with 2 girls (I did not pick them, it was random and the management said that living with them was the only option left). I live in a single room, and the two girls share a double. I get along with one of them very well, but the other one is an utter waste of space. Both me and the one I get along with do not like this other girl, and she isn't too fond of us either, and this is mostly because our lifestyles are polar opposites. We have very intensive schoolwork and rarely make any noise or go out much, while the other girl most likely couldn't care less about school, constantly has friends over, and depending on the night, they are sometimes extremely obnoxious. This aside, all three of us are civil with each other, we don't fight or anything, we're respectful.

So here is the problem - my room isn't really a room. I don't have walls, but instead have these sliding panels that act as my ""walls."" This ""room"" is an extension of the kitchen/living room (this apartment is very small). Consequently, I can hear anything and everything that is going on in there. Roommate I get along with went home for the weekend and basically what happened and why I'm writing this is that the other one came home from going out at around 12:30 in the morning last night with about 6 people while I was sleeping. As they walked in, they were yelling and laughing as if they had the place to themselves. They all went into her room, blasted music, and continued being annoying. My roommate and some guy eventually walked out to find a lighter or something, they left the door open, and basically it's just music blasting in the entire apartment, girls screeching and laughing, some guy yelling stupid shit, and I'm here in my ""room"" hearing it all crystal clear because let's be honest, I'm in the room with them. These sliding panels are not walls and do not cancel out sound. They don't even cover the entire length from the floor to the ceiling. This is all particularly infuriating because I have to be up between 6:00 and 7:00 in the morning every single day of the week for work or school, and I have told this roommate exactly this, but she obviously wasn't listening or didn't care. Maybe this all sounds like me pitying myself, but it's honestly so much different when you're there dealing with it. 

So here's where I'm at now: this was so disrespectful and inconsiderate that I'm done with her. She tends to treat the kitchen/living room as if it is her own room, always having friends over, watching TV and talking and laughing and smoking with them for hours a day, and I hear ALL of it. Seriously, they can mumble and I will hear it perfectly from my ""room.""

I don't want to allow this anymore, and I want to know if I can do this. Since the living room isn't HER room, the way I understand it is that if I don't want any of her friends in there, I can make them leave. And if worse came to worst where they just refused to leave or whatever and I called the cops, that they would side with me. I'd tell her that she can have friends over in HER room, but that hanging out in the LIVING room needs to stop. If I had walls, I'd most likely not have a problem with it, but I don't and so long as I'm paying this ridiculous amount for a ""room"", then I need my peace. And if it matters at all, the other roommate would side with me 100%.

I have some learning to do and was hoping to get some advice here. I started talking to a boy, for about a month now. We have decided not to have sex until we are official. Which I'm OK with for the following reason: he has a 10 inch baby anaconda in his pants.

While I'm a vers bottom, I'm no power bottom by any means. How the actual fuck will it get in there? A girl friend of mine told me to try numbing lube. She gave her boyfriend the backdoor entrance for his birthday recently, and that was her preperation. Until then I never knew such a thing existed.

I anticipate him and I to be official and I want him to...well...fuck my brains out, and me to survive another day. Any advice??? Thanks!!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys! I have some learning to do and was hoping to get some advice here. I started talking to a boy, for about a month now.
