Based on the sexual assault history of 4 out of the 6 gay people he knows, he developed a theory of gay origins. 

His hypothesis is that homosexuality is a psychological reaction to trauma experienced earlier in life. For about 67% of the gay community he claims this trauma to be a result of sexual assault, and the remaining percentage deals with other environmental factors that would have led to social outcasting. 

He admittedly has done zero research, but spews his theory out with such certainty that I became infuriated. It just seemed like a typical southern/close-minded approach, and the worst part was that another friend agreed with some parts of his theory despite only surveying 6 people. As someone that values definitive research, I admittedly attempted an argument but could only come up with bullshit after he requested sources that discredited his claims and I was unprepared for such a discussion.

In certain positions sometimes it feels as if I need to pee when I don't, and if I recall correctly sometimes it can feel like that and idk

I'm mostly just looking to hear other people's experienced about having their prostate hit and stuff and what it feels like?

Cos a few times that he's been fingering me he must've hit it cos I basically involuntarily collapsed, but when he hits it with his dick (I think that's what's happening) it makes me feel as if I need to piss/feel as if I have a full bladder.

IDK... thoughts anyone?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey, I&amp;#39;m relatively inexperienced when it comes to sex, and I&amp;#39;ve only had sex with the guy I&amp;#39;m seeing, and it&amp;#39;s only been a few times so far. It&amp;#39;s been awesome and I&amp;#39;ve really enjoyed it, but I&amp;#39;m curious as to the what it actually feels like when your prostate is hit and whether or not it&amp;#39;s an inherently pleasurable feeling or you adjust to it and find it pleasurable.&lt;/p&gt;

so first of all this is a throwaway account for reasons that will become clear soon. and this is kinda going to be a mix of questions.

so recently I've been questioning my sexuality, and by that i mean. i like or used to like girls but recently I've been craving the d. for starters i have not done anything sexual 
with another being at all, and i used to think girls were attractive. and i still kinda do, but i find men more attractive and they turn me on more than woman. so i believe that i have come to
the conclusion that i am either bisexual or just plain gay. but i know that there is going to be no way of coming out to my family at all. my parents are SUPER conservative and believe that gay and homosexuality
is a huge no no. i hear them say slurs and other mean things about gays, that they should die and its not right and the other things that conservative people say.and for this i think i will never be able to live the life i want, without
being disowned or kicked out of the house, and my family not wanting me to be a part of them anymore. its really quite a depressing life in this house. so that's the end of my first question really. 
and that is
what should i do about this situation?

and my second question is this,
im 19 turning 20 soon and never had an actual realationship, so i've been lonely recently which has caused me to go onto online dating sites. me and this guy have been talking for a while now
and it seems that we have a lot in common. he seems cool and i kinda have been danciing around the possibility of meeting up. but because of me being super closeted
im afraid of people seeing me out with a guy. i guess it could seem that we are friends or something but i dunno. anyways going back to my point before. i really wanna meet up with this guy, but im not sure how i would go about it.
do i tell him that im in the closet? do i not persue or talk to anyone of the same gender because being in the closet? my situation is tuff. and i don't really know how i would come out to my family. 
i love them so much that if i were to come out and they not want me in thier house anymore. i dont know what i would do. i love my family, but i also want a healthy relationship with a person.
so please bros, tell me what should i do?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;help me bros,&lt;/p&gt;

I hope that this is appropriate subreddit for my sob story. Before you start reading I must warn you that long wall of text is ahead and formatting may be off due to me using my smartphone. Anyway, I'm a long time lurker here and elsewhere, but let me introduce myself first.

My name is Richard. I'm a typical 20 year old guy from Eastern Europe who tries to find positive things everywhere even when there seems no escape from engulfing darkness.
I remember I had a good childhood, it seemed like I lived in wealthy family though I never understood why my mother would cry now and then, but I did my very best to make her feel better; there's a special bond between us, though she loves my older siblings no less.
When I grew a bit older I understood the reason behind my mom's tears - it was dad's gambling addiction (it's really hard to call this person father after all he had done to our family).
Long story short we lost two of three apartments, had a huge debt that persists till this very day and his mother moved into our tiny two room apartment. It was a living hell, mom didn't divorce with him because she doesn't want to end up on the street. His mother loved noone, but her son and blamed us. She slowly became insane (imagine the horror of living with a crazy old woman in next room) until she died and my mom paid for her funeral; the swine couldn't afford it because he gambled everything he could including his mother's money.
After her death everything is pretty much till this very day: my 30 year brother who's alcoholic and defends father, mom and me in one room, the man in other one. You might ask me why the heck I wouldn't move out, I'm 20 years old ect, ect...
The thing is that I'm a full time medical student and I wouldn't have time for a job to afford living outside of this hellhole (it reeks of death; houseplants and aquarium fish die now and then).

Everything would be fine, I could overcome these obstacles if I wasn't gay. My family's very homophobic and it's killing me from the inside. I try to put up fake smile everyday, but my insides are boiling from pain and guilt. Even my dearest, sweetest mother, whom I love unconditionally, made painful comments when I tri ed to make my hair the way I liked by saying ""With hair like this you look like you know who...."" with a disappointment in her face. Mind you I'm in a closet and I'm never planning to come out to my family members especially my mom; I don't want to hurt her, she's been through too much, her mother died because of him... i can't hurt her like that.

I'm 99% sure that I'm gay though several events in my life keep bugging me about this fact. My childhood's best friend, let's call him George. I was 9 and he was 13. I vividly remember that I had no gay feelings back then... anyway... I used to stay at night at George's place and I was sexually abused. It felt disgusting, he twisted me and taught me things no 9 year old should ever know. I'm wondering if this played role of me becoming gay.

Now here I am - caught in this limbo. I want to love, I've never experienced a true love in my life, not even from my family. I feel hollow and broken, not wanted and hated by myself. Thoughts about suicide are not rare, but my mother keeps me from doing it; as I said I'd never want to hurt her.
I often catch myself at a thought that I could abandon everything, move to England to pick strawberries or sonething and live freely and perhaps find a true love. But I can't abandon my studies, everyone would be disappointed.

Help me.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi bros!

&lt;p&gt;Everything would be fine, I could overcome these obstacles if I wasn&amp;#39;t gay. My family&amp;#39;s very homophobic and it&amp;#39;s killing me from the inside. I try to put up fake smile everyday, but my insides are boiling from pain and guilt. Even my dearest, sweetest mother, whom I love unconditionally, made painful comments when I tri ed to make my hair the way I liked by saying &amp;quot;With hair like this you look like you know who....&amp;quot; with a disappointment in her face. Mind you I&amp;#39;m in a closet and I&amp;#39;m never planning to come out to my family members especially my mom; I don&amp;#39;t want to hurt her, she&amp;#39;s been through too much, her mother died because of him... i can&amp;#39;t hurt her like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m 99% sure that I&amp;#39;m gay though several events in my life keep bugging me about this fact. My childhood&amp;#39;s best friend, let&amp;#39;s call him George. I was 9 and he was 13. I vividly remember that I had no gay feelings back then... anyway... I used to stay at night at George&amp;#39;s place and I was sexually abused. It felt disgusting, he twisted me and taught me things no 9 year old should ever know. I&amp;#39;m wondering if this played role of me becoming gay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now here I am - caught in this limbo. I want to love, I&amp;#39;ve never experienced a true love in my life, not even from my family. I feel hollow and broken, not wanted and hated by myself. Thoughts about suicide are not rare, but my mother keeps me from doing it; as I said I&amp;#39;d never want to hurt her.
I often catch myself at a thought that I could abandon everything, move to England to pick strawberries or sonething and live freely and perhaps find a true love. But I can&amp;#39;t abandon my studies, everyone would be disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Help me.&lt;/p&gt;

More specifically:
When do you usually move from 'seeing' to 'dating'? How long do you usually date for before you ask if 'you date each other exclusively'? At what point do you introduce the 'boyfriend' label concept?

A little background: I have bad anxiety, but it comes and goes. Sme days I can't stand t be around people and other days I can go to a concert by myself (almost) no issue. My father beat me growing up, not regularly, but he was a mean drunk. He's threaten my life, my own mother has pulled a knife on him, and he put me in the hospital when I was 22 (he has screws in his bones now, breaking them from punching me).

So it makes sense that I've never cared for being touched by anyone. My friends used to comment on it in middle school, but I'm fine with hugging people or shaking hands ad shit like that. I picked up a bit of a substance abuse problem along the way, but since starting therapy it's getting better! I still drink, but more responsibly.

I've never been able to make out with anyone sober, and even still few and far instance in between. This weekend, a good friend of mine wanted to hook up, and I just couldn't. We got in a big fight (she was fucking pissed) and when I got home I went into a full blown anxiety attack. Hyperventilating, vomiting, shaking- not a good scene.

It's an extreme overreaction to the situation, no doubt about that. My therapist and I talked it through, and she thinks my extreme aversion to intamcy may be because I'm gay and in denial. Honestly, I've thought about it before, but I've been propositioned by men before and declined. No real reason other than wasnt interested (but I never had the extreme reaction I had here).

I guess I'm just lashing out for guidance; I don't know what to think if it all. I've seen my share of gay porn, but during my research I've come across r/totallystraight, which if it is sincere, kind of descri Ed where I'm at. I have no tolerance for abuse against women (my father treated my mom like shit- she's strong but I'll never figure out why she stayed) and so I kind of view any contact (intamcy) with women (and I suppose men too, again, wasn't really on my radar until recently) as violence, and i just don't want to hurt anyone.

I can give more info, but mostly I appreciate you all letting me vent.

Almost 6 months ago I got the “you like each other!” message on OKC. I couldn’t believe it, it was the guy I thought was way out of my league. He was handsome but incredibly cute at the same time.  I sent the first message and he replied. It went on from there for about a week before exchanging numbers. Few days of texting turned into phone calls and planning to meet up. We had our first date in November. It was your average first day but it went well. We continued talking and trying to meet. In between there and NYE he bailed on date plans three times. He’s a retail manger with a long commute so our schedules/responsibilities don’t also align. Understandable. In January we went out again, this time he was more somber but claimed he was just tired. A decent date. A week after date two, we made plans to go out again. The day of, I received a text “I really really enjoy talking to you and I want to hang out more. I’d like to be friends for now if that’s possible. I need to keep working on me” (months before we met he had come out of a four year relationship and they lived together). Normally I’d brush this text off to never hear from them again. But at this point, we’ve been talking every day. We knew about each other’s families, we shared too many selfies, flirted etc. So we continued on. A month ago I had the courage to inquire about being in the friend zone. I was also feeling uneasy about our lack of face to face interaction. What’s wrong with going out for beers? So the reply to my question was “Maybe, maybeee not”. Not the clearest answer but it perked my spirits He even acknowledged that we needed to hangout. . I felt validated and thought he was finally coming around. 
Last sunday, in his own way, he suggested going out tues or wed when he had off. I reaffirmed the idea Monday and he agreed.  No mention of plans throughout texting tues so I asked. He replied with he had to help out a friend and tonight wouldn’t work. Our texts went silent for most of that night, unusual on a day off. I asked about wed and kept getting one word, vague answers of “maybe”. Basically being ignored. Wed came, I made backup plans and inquired again. Another excuse, similar to what he used many times before. Seeing as we’re friends I politely asked as what’s going on, why the big change. He ignored it and replied with “look at all the new emojis in the new update!” An hour later ignoring him he sends a selfie. I couldn’t think of anything nice to say so I asked him to reread his texts. 4 pages later of excuses and still liking me in a friendly way and continuing to talk like we have but it’s not going any further. I replied with a thumbs up and left it alone and haven’t heard a peep.
I probably should’ve stopped this whole thing after getting bailed on the first two times but I thought there was something more. I’m not really mad about this whole thing, slightly bummed but feel more as if I was used. I wasted all this energy and nothing came out of it. I’m madder at myself for not following my gut. Like did I set myself up for this? Did I read too much into our casual conversations? Idk. 
Anyone else been in a similar situation? Sorry for this being so long.
Thanks!

I am recently married. I have had 2 occasions a man has gone down on me. Once when I was black out drunk and a 2nd while he was hitting on me and he talked me into sucking me off. 

Now I am here because I want to know more about being gay. I mean do I have to leave my wife if I am curious? Is there anyone who lives close to me who could maybe show me? I have a billion questions and I have no idea how to ask or who to ask? 

I do know seeing or watching gay porn makes me hard. If anyone feels they have time maybe PM me or add me on snapchat? just looking for someone who can help me figure this out. &gt;.&lt;
