I'm in a relationship with a guy, and it's awesome. Emotional connection etc. 
We started fooling around for the first time this morning. 
As soon as I start blowing him, he loses his erection. He was really turned on and otherwise we have good chemistry. 
As for me, when he blew me it felt really really intense, like every time his mouth went over my head I couldn't help but moan and squirm. It was so intense that I couldn't really ejaculate, I could only handle it really slowly and we gave up. 

I mean I'm pretty sure its just nerves, and probably a lack of skill. It was his first time with a guy and I have little experience too. (And a similar thing happened with my one ex)

Can you give us some tips? How can we work towards getting each other off? Overcoming nerves, etc. Any ideas? Strategies?

Tricky subject. I'll make it simple. I'm looking for perspective, or similar experience. Opinions in other words.

**ALRIGHT**, so, I'm not new to sex. Not at all. I'm not very active, but I had my share of experiences (and a BF during 6 months) for my 6 years out of the closet (I'm now 23). That said, I'm starting to worry about something quite obvious by this thread's title: blowjobs.

Receiving oral sex makes me lose my erection. Each. Damn. Time. It ended causing tension in my only relationship: I said I didn't like it so he never went there, but eventually got frustrated of not being able to do anything worth mentioning on my dick with his mouth. I felt like I was depriving him of something major in homosexual relationships... And he broke up (it's not the main factor but surely it must have not helped), which made me realize not everybody is open to that.

I follow a therapist, but so far his only advices was to try, again and again, and to *learn* to eventually like it.

... But it doesn't happen :(

And I'm worried that because of that, men I sleep with or start dating might get sad/disappointed/hurt (?) that I just can't keep my boner when they *proceed* there. It makes me feel insecure in a way and I just hate how I can't allow them to like blowing me... Since gay men all like to blow (as far as I'm aware? lol), it's kind of whack if one of the guy can't practice it.
On the other hand, I noticed that when we are both active during sex (instead of having the other guy's head down there while I'm being passive) I don't have any issue. It seems like the minute I become passive + the blowjob, it's an instant kill (on the other hand I love giving 'em).

My point is: I'm not a waste, but I'd like to know if some of you have once dealt with people like that/if some of you dislike blowjobs too and how you handle that? I know there are workarounds/alternatives during sex, but these don't last forever and I fear men I date often might eventually get bored/tired of not being able to do any good working blowjobs on me... and I don't know many gays who could live without giving blowjobs often... Which reduce my possibilities in relationships, I think. ._.'

Thank you!

So I'm going to be moving out of my Mum's house for the first time ever (I'm 23) in a few months, I'll be moving to a house in another city with my best friend and two other girls that live there and it'll also be my first time living away from home and this town.

The thing is **I really don't like change**, the idea of moving to a new house in a different city (though I am somewhat familiar with the city already) and the fact that I'll have to find a new job in the city **scares the living shit out of me**. I'm scared that I won't be cut out for the job and it doesn't turn out to be what I expected, I would go into a job like what I've got at the moment but *I really hate my job* but I am comfortable with it and I know I can do it easily.

I'm just really scared that I won't be any good at anything I apply for or that it won't be anything like what is advertised, I'm scared that I'll be stuck in a dead-end job that won't allow me to further my career (like my current job), and I'm especially scared that I won't get along with anyone there (socially awkward here).

*The reason I'm moving is because there is nothing for me in this town and it's making me miserable, there's not many gay guys here so my love life is non-existent and I won't be able to make a career for myself in my current job as I'm wanting to learn more than what they're willing to teach.*

Any advice on what I can do to make myself feel less anxious about leaving my comfort-zone?

But sexually and emotionally I'm into top men who enjoy 'wearing the pants' so to speak. It's not necessarily about kink, but really I only feel emotionally and sexually satisfied with men who really enjoy being dominant.

But I'm tall, I'm hairy. I'm a big, imposing bear with terrible social skills. I'm a cute guy and do get hit on / complimented, and am working on my body, but I'm not sure how to seek out guys who fit the criteria I need for me to be happy. I feel like these guys usually want some small little twink - and I'm nothing close to that and never will be.

I used mostly Scruff and OKcupid. Scruff is good for finding guys who might be interested in what I am, but they're mostly after sex - and I'm a little tired of hookups. But part of me almost feels like I couldn't meet the type of guy I want unless hop in the sack first :\ As for OKcupid, the guys I've met from there are always very sweet, but never seem to be what I'm looking for.

Bros, how do I search for the type of guy I want? I'm not hung up on appearance or size.
