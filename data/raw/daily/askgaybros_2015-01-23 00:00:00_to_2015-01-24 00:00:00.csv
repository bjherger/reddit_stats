Anyways, I have taken the liberty of coming up with a shirt design for CT Pride, and I am looking for some ideas. Just for my group of friends, not for everyone. 

My first thought was for something [basic](http://imgur.com/a/7bC32#0) but I am open to some more pun-drenched slogans if you guys know of any cool ones (the guy who made our shirts last year: ""Sometimes you need to swallow your pride, sometimes you need to swallow somebody else's.""  not exactly my favourite shirt ever, and I want to make something a bit more non-specific so that you can actually wear it afterwards)

So if you have any ideas, please throw them this way.

As I write this, this seriously sounds like a soap opera, so hopefully everything is clear. I was originally planning on coming out to my family this time last year. I knew I should do it at some point, but I wanted to for sure last year since I was already basically ready to do so. Add in the added fun bonus that I found my middle brother (I'm the oldest of three) on Grindr as well (and immediately blocked him after screenshotting the profile). However, I chose to not come out to my family after my Dad dropped a gigantic bomb and decided to leave the family. I don't know what compels someone to leave their family after 25 years and act like my Dad has acted, but that's another discussion entirely. The divorce was finalized a couple weeks ago, and I am finally achieving somewhat of a ""new normal."" I held off on coming out to my family just because I seriously believed that anything else foreign and shocking to my mother might legitimately kill her. But I'm tired of hiding and to be completely honest, I think Mom already knows.

A little background. I go to school far from home. I've realized that my middle brother needs me but also is in a situation where he doesn't trust me with much. Oddly enough, the wreckage that my asshat of a Dad has caused might actually be the best thing that could have happened for me and my middle brother in terms of our relationship. I originally thought about confronting with him with it outright and just being like **""We're gay!""** but realized that that would completely force him to do something he might not be ready for.

Not to be arrogant or anything, but me and my brother are both really smart and similar in a lot of ways. We're both really into science/ majoring in science, go to similar schools, will definitely be very successful professionally and even are planning on going into similar areas of healthcare. Oh, and yeah we're also both into penis. Surprise!
However, we're also wildly different when you look at us closer. I'm extroverted, a people person, hugely into arts as well as science, and I'm this dominant, excited, loud ENFP that gets things when it comes to intuition about people (which is why it's so fucked up that I can't figure out this dilemma, because usually I just GET what I should do in lots of social situations). My middle brother, on the other hand, is this introverted kid who has experienced a lot of same hardships in life that I have with wildly different results. We both got bullied in school, but I took on the ""fuck you and your face"" ballsy attitude, while he internalized everything. His trust issues are OUT. THE. WAZOO. People always think that I'm smarter because I'm Type A and OCDish about life in general. In reality, my brother taught himself to speed-read at age 12, stole the 5th Harry Potter Book from my room, and finished it in like about 12-15 hours. I shit you not. Compare our smarts and he is Einstein, I am a boulder rock thing. There's like not even a comparison. My middle brother is specifically very often apprehensive about talking with me especially because of how excited I get about things. I think I overwhelm him a lot. I also distribute my problems among other people I trust to cope, so I know not to come to him with a lot of issues because it'll actually just make him feel worse while making me feel better because of how he internalizes things. I'm working on it. My roommate is also an introvert and a psychology major, so whenever we get to talking I just really try to figure out what I can do to not overwhelm my brother with my extroversion and personality in general. It's like the relationship where I know he loves me and stuff, but like I'll hug him and it'll be like ""don't make me stab you.""

This is why I haven't really come out to him, since I feel like it might actually make it **HARDER** for him to come out to me. I want him to know that I love him so much and that I'm there for him and that **WE'RE GAY**, not that **HE'S GAY** (sorry, according to my youngest brother, he's bi. Definite difference, but I was going for literary insightfulness) So instead of coming out to him or like interrogating him and being fucking weird in the hopes that I can force him to come out to me, I've worked on fostering the relationship I have with him in the hopes that he might eventually tell me or that we'll get to a point in a conversation where I know that I can tell him and it will be ok. Like I said before, I recently spoke with my youngest brother, who I am much closer with, and was much more relieved since I learned that my brother has come out to my youngest brother as bisexual. So at least he can talk to someone in the family about it, if not me. (It kind of hurt initially too, but then I realized that it was most likely my own damn fault that my middle brother doesn't trust me and I need to work on improving our relationship severely).

So here I am still not out to my family a year after my Dad has divorced my Mom, who has financially destroyed everything that we had as a family, all the while driving everyone into an abyss. This abyss consists of an awesome combination of quadrupled student loans (Dad doesn't do anything for us kids anymore except pay minimum loan amounts and let us stay on insurance), therapy, and awkward closeted fabulousness. So here are my specific questions! I really want to come out to my family in entirety. Even my Dad, who honestly just is so pathetic that it doesn't matter anyway because he doesn't want anything to do with any of us anymore anyway. He doesn't even deserve anything from me at this point, but even though he has destroyed us all, it's still really obvious he's mentally sick. He's of the brilliant opinion that depression doesn't exist and that he can just deal with whatever he is dealing with on his own. He seriously thinks that his thought processes are normal. He's textbook functional depression and mid-life crisis. But he's divorced my Mom and is living with his sister, so the best I can do is consistently remind him that he doesn't have to keep living in the misery that he's in, while at the same time keeping my distance because he is incredibly toxic, has little to offer me willingly as a father anymore, and is very manic (by that, I mean he can be very calm and cool, or you could catch him in a mood and he'll want to destroy your soul for asking him two questions at once). I'm going home in two weeks and was going to come out to my Mom, but also to my 17 year old 
brother, my 20 year old brother, and yes, even my Dad.

SO
1) Should I wait? Is it still too soon for my Mom? I feel like, as a Mom, she already knows but might not know that at least two of her three sons are gay (or in my brother's case, bisexual). I don't know how much it will hurt her and what my Dad has done to her almost killed her. Literally. 

2) Should I even bother with my Dad, since he clearly doesn't give a shit about me? He's honestly the one I'm **LEAST** worried about. I would have been more worried before, since a year ago I thought he was one of the greatest people alive. Now, all he cares about it his own money and individual happiness and has virtually abandoned all of his responsibilities. (Again, it's really obvious he's suffering with his own stuff, but he's injured me and my family so badly, and he denies any symptoms of depression, so there are parts of me that assume that he might not be depressed and actually just is a really terrible person that managed to lie to his family about actually caring for 20 years.) It would honestly be a great big ""fuck you"" to be like ""I'm gay, I don't even care what you think of me Dad, have a great life."" What's he going to do, make me pay all my bills? He's already done that, not to mention fucked me and my entire family over. Parts of me want to kill him. Parts of me hate him so much I wish he had died. And parts of me just feel sorry for him because I know what he's in for. I'm well on my way to becoming awesomely professional and successful in the healthcare field after college (I'll just have over half a million dollars in student debt plus interest, it's fine). I will be fine either way, but I don't know if he will be.

3) Should I tell my bisexual brother, who has already come out to my youngest brother, that I'm gay and that I've know since he was in high school that he was into dudes? I want to tell him how sorry I am for not letting him know sooner that he has someone he could talk to about it. I want him to know that I'm here for him and that I'm never going to leave him like my Dad just did. But he also is someone that is so introverted and private, that my extroverted self gets it and knows that I need to put his needs ahead of my own and let him do his own thing at his own pace. 

4) Should I come out to my youngest brother, who has no idea that I'm gay and who I have the greatest relationship in the world with? He told me that my middle brother was bisexual after I had very deep conversation with him, something that is regular for me and him but not for me and my middle brother. I know he's 17 and some homophobia at that age is normal, but he will often make comments about my middle brother when we are together that make me fearful of the relationship that I have with him now. He makes me feel way cooler than I actually am because he tells all of his friends all of the stuff that I do. One of his friends once told me (and I quote) that I'm ""like a combination of a father, an older brother, and a god to him now that my Dad is out of the picture."" How do I even deal with that? What if my brother needs an older brother/father combo that's faker to him instead of the real, gay older brother that could very well end up being more foreign to him?

5) If I'm ready to come out to everyone, does that automatically mean that they should be ready for me? If I should wait, when should I do it? How long should I wait? I really don't want to be in a situation where my middle brother comes out to the family and I'm still not out yet.

6) Should I do it individually? Maybe come out to my Mom and brothers, then come out to my Dad? Or should I come out to my middle brother and come out to our family together? (This is my favorite option, but I can already see my middle brother cringing at the bonding). 

7) Does anyone actually even believe this story? I don't and it's my legitimate life.

I'm a First time poster. First of all I really appreciate the community here and it has helped me a lot just seeing other's questions and your support of them.


Despite that I'm not sure I'm a gay bro. I really began to understand my identity when I discovered Aven and began to identify as being asexual. While being asexual I guess I've always had more of an attraction towards men. For the longest time this attraction was typically based on aesthetics/personality but I never really experienced any sexual attraction. When I'm attracted to someone at this stage all I really want to do is be friends. It just feels like a craving to be friends with someone. I think it's worth saying that I'm in my mid 20's


In the last couple years I've developed a deep friendship with someone and now I've started to experience a more sensual attraction (hugging and snuggling etc.). This attraction is isolated to the one friend and is accompanied for a desire to be exclusive. Kissing and sex still seem really strange and foreign to me and I really don't have a desire to do them (but would try my best if I had a partner who wanted to). 


(As a side note all these posts about being in love with your straight friend. I get it. I'm so sorry. It sucks.)


I grew up deeply religious (and still hold the faith), but am an open and vocal gay rights activist within and without the church. I suppose it's possible I'm deeply closeted and I just don't know it. It feels unlikely though. I've looked at gay porn, and straight porn, it's just nothing. People arbitrarily doing strange things with their own and other's body parts.


I guess my question is... Am I as good as gay? I don't like girls, and someday wouldn't mind having a partner/adventurer/friend to live my life with (with or without more sexual elements). I feel like others would say the desire to be with another man makes me gay. But identifying as gay just doesn't feel right, I feel like it misrepresents me (but perhaps only in a sexual sense).


What should I do gay bros? Should I casually identify as gay and clarify if necessary or hold fast to a complex sexual identity that most people don't understand? Am I just closeted? Are gay partners on the menu or should I stick to the (much smaller) asexual demihomoromantosensual crowd? 


Either way I find the community here really incredible and helpful and will continue to hang around.


**TLDR:** I want a man, just not sexually. Am I as good as gay?

I haven't seen him in over a year, and haven't spoken to him in months.  He used to be extremely angry at me and had stated in the past he never wanted to be friends again.

we ended up talking for about three weeks before we met up for coffee.  communication during that time was extremely inconsistent sometimes he would reply quickly other times he would ignore me completely.  I text every couple of days, he never seemed angry about how much I was messaging him.  when we did meet up we talk for about two hours catching up on things and generally getting to know each other again.  He was warm, friendly and engaging, and seemed to genuinely interested in our friendship.  I thought that things were starting to smooth over.

Now that a couple of days have passed I haven't heard from him.  I sent a text saying that it was nice seeing him again, and a text seeing if he was free next week sometime to hangout.  I still haven't gotten a response back.  

I a somewhat confused why he would suddenly shut down like that.  I didn't feel like I was pressuring him to do anything, but it bothers me that he is running hot and cold like this.

Update:  So he did text me back.  Essentially he was worried that it sound like a date when I asked him to hang out.  Anyway, it seems that he's worried that I still had feeling for him and/or wanted to reignite the relationship.  I guess it all came down to a misunderstanding.  I reminded him that I was in a relationship, and only considered him a friend.  That I didn't intend for it to sound like a date, and he was welcome to include anybody when we hung out.

God dammit guys, what the hell did I get myself into? I'm in kinda a lot of pain right now and even more confused than before. Venting again.

He came over again two days ago after classes. We invited friends to come drink with us, including his girlfriend. He got pretty drunk as the night continued, they started arguing (which happens pretty much constantly every day and makes for a lot of awkward situations), it gets really heated, he tells her he's breaking up with her and he tries to take her home. Keep in mind they ""break up"" like almost every day and end up getting back together so this is nothing too out of the ordinary. I tell him he's not driving and volunteer to take her (I've only had a beer at this point). He says ok and we all three get in my car, with her in the back. 

We end up taking her home, he walked her to her door to ""finalize"" things I guess, and we're alone in the car on the way back to my apartment when he starts on with his usual spiel about how I'm the only person he can stand on this campus, how we need to get away from this place, all that kinda stuff. Then just as we're pulling back into my apartment I can feel him staring at me, so I look back at him, and he PLANTS A BIG FUCKING KISS RIGHT ON MY LIPS. AND I DIDN'T RETURN IT. For one, I was pretty much in shock. I didn't EVER expect that to happen, let alone so soon. Two, he was drunk. Three, I didn't believe that he was truly done with his gf and I felt pretty bad for her cuz of what happened that night. It was pretty much the hardest thing I've ever had to (not) do. All I did was kinda pull away, look back at him, and manage to spit out a ""Really?""  He responds, ""Well, I am pretty drunk."" I didn't really know what to do/say after that so I kind of let the tension die off in silence.

We get inside my apartment and we're the only ones there. I go to where my laptop is and ask, ""Since you just tried to kiss me, can I show you something?"" I opened Reddit and went to the original submission I made a couple of days ago about the situation (link above) and told him to read EVERYTHING. And he did. He was probably reading silently for like 10-15 minutes before people started coming back in, and he was still reading after that. He was pretty intently focused so people started curiously trying to see what it was, but he kept it turned only toward himself. After he was done reading, he closed the laptop and just kind of nonchalantly looked at me in front of everyone and said, ""Yeah, I'll move with you."" Which didn't really make sense to anything related to the post, but I think maybe he said that because he was trying to answer without cuing anyone else in on what was happening. I just said ""Ok."" After a while, everyone started leaving and nothing else happened between us that night. I couldn't sleep at all because of how much I was regretting not reciprocating his advances and how I was thinking I probably definitely have feelings for him now if I didn't before.

He showed up at my house again yesterday early in the morning. We sit on the couch together, start talking for a bit, and I notice that he's texting someone on his phone. I ask who it is, surprise, it's his ""ex""-gf. He asks me if he should get back with her. Like nothing happened between us. I get pretty noticeably miffed and kinda short with him, basically muttering ""I dunno."" THEN I look over to the direction of his texts (wrong of me, I know) and notice he is straight-up begging, grovelling, pleading with her to get back with him, how he loves her so much, he regrets breaking up with her, she's the only girl he ever wants to be with, etc.  It really hurt to read that, to the point where I started to feel physically sick, and I pretty much completely shut down from him and started using one-word responses, not initiating any conversation with him at all from then on. He shortly left for classes after that and I found out he ended up spending the night with her, and I'm pretty sure they're back together now.

I'm just really puzzled right now and my feelings are going haywire. Last night I decided to ask a few close of our mutual friends (all straight guys) their opinions on the matter, and they agreed that they had always questioned his sexuality, and apparently I'm the only one who never got the memo. One even said that they saw a contact listed as ""Brad:))"" in his phone at one point. DOUBLE SMILEY FACE. That's usually reserved for crushes/love interests, right? Also, the same night he kissed me, he said he would have a threesome with me BEFORE HE WAS EVEN DRUNK (while his gf wasn't in the room), which led to some weird glances from our friends.

I want to talk to him. I want to confront him about his sexuality now that I have more evidence. I want to know what I am to him. But I feel like I already missed my chance. He's back with his girlfriend again so it would be wrong of me to bring it up, right? And it's clear from the text messages that he still really wants to be with her. I'm just really at a loss of what to do now. Jesus lord help me I'm so confused.

Some of my questions:

* Has anyone else had a relationship survive 6-12 months apart and with the stress and anxiety of knowing your partner is in harms way?
* Should I ask him to marry me before he goes? He works a civilian job on the weekends and some nights. If we were married he'd make more money and could quit his civilian job thus allowing us to spend more time together over the next couple of months before he goes. It would also ensure that I could be updated on what's going on with him while he's gone. I am completely financially secure and independent, so the money he makes doesn't matter to me, but it would give him the ability to spend more time with me before he goes. It may sound purely practical and not romantic, but I do love him and have though about marriage with him, but it was a further off, long from now thing. That said, I'd be willing to jump in early and take my chances if I thought it would help us both.
* Are there resources and support structures for gay SOs of deployed soldiers? I know there's FRG for family, but being gay I'm not sure how welcome or part of the group I'd feel. Maybe it wouldn't matter, but I'm just wondering and thinking out loud.
* How often can we communicate while he's deployed? Skype? Phone? Email? Letters? Can I send things? His MOS will have him at base 100% of the time; he wont be in the field or in combat, so I assume he'll be able to communicate regularly but I don't know.
* Is it foolish to think we can pull this off? Are we better off ending it or do couples make it through this?

I'm a closeted gay guy (19) and I originally come from a very homophobic country. Right now I live in Australia though and I feel like I can finally practice my sexuality (sort of). 


I'm an introvert and the easiest way for me to meet other gay guys is through Grindr (let me know if there are better ways, I've heard criticisms about Grindr). With that said, I really don't want to pick up an STD and will avoid anything that would put me in the danger of picking up an STD (within reason of course). This means that I do not want to:


1. Have anal sex. 
2. Have oral sex. 
3. Kiss mouth to mouth. 


However, what I want is the company of an understanding guy that would be down to be friends first of all (after all I'm new here and don't know many people), and willing to cuddle and engage in any other sexual activity that is not mentioned above (e.g. handjobs, toys, etc.).  I have an apartment where we can watch movies together etc and do whatever we want discreetly (also important). 



Quite obviously I'm very inexperienced and I really need your advice guys. Let me know if there's anything wrong with my thinking.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey folks, &lt;/p&gt;

I feel really alone bros. Today, five years ago, I broke up with my last boyfriend and I never find someone to stay with. I don't miss the last guy, I just miss the situation. And I don't know what to think at this moment.

I'm a 27 years old guy who loves his life, his friends and his family. I really enjoy doing a lot of things: traveling (I'm at Bali right now), eating/cooking for friends, music, reading, writing, meet new people, talk with them, nightlife... I work in a five star hotel as host and I love it, in a beautiful medium sized town at the south of Spain with good weather, nice people and a lot of things to do. And if I have to choose something good about me, is my sense of humour. I promise, I can wake up jumping from the bed in a rainy Monday to go to work. In the opposite, sometimes I'm little bit strict in my opinions, lazy and inconstant with routines. I hate routines. All of them. 

Definitely, I'm happy. But alone. The few people that I thought that were interesting were finally boring people,a copy of a copy of someone, people who only can have ""standard"" conversations or attitude. I even sometimes play to guess what's the next phrase they're gone say in a WhatsApp conversation. And I win 80% of times. 

With this I don't want to appear like a ""no one understand me!"" or trying to be over anyone. I don't have any problem admiting my mistakes, listening to advices and being humble. But I'm close to the 30s and I don't know what's going to happen from now and on. 

If anyone ask for it, I'm not such a model but I'm not ugly according to a general opinion. Not fit, not fat, tall, not into a urban tribe...

What I'm doing wrong? Why I feel like this, if I have (and thanks) a nice life? Thanks for reading this even if you don't ;)

Edit: thanks to you all bros. Seriously. I was not sure about write this kind of things but it deserves. You've helped me more than you know. Love you all :)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sorry if I use wrong words or orthography mistakes, English is not my first language)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel really alone bros. Today, five years ago, I broke up with my last boyfriend and I never find someone to stay with. I don&amp;#39;t miss the last guy, I just miss the situation. And I don&amp;#39;t know what to think at this moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a 27 years old guy who loves his life, his friends and his family. I really enjoy doing a lot of things: traveling (I&amp;#39;m at Bali right now), eating/cooking for friends, music, reading, writing, meet new people, talk with them, nightlife... I work in a five star hotel as host and I love it, in a beautiful medium sized town at the south of Spain with good weather, nice people and a lot of things to do. And if I have to choose something good about me, is my sense of humour. I promise, I can wake up jumping from the bed in a rainy Monday to go to work.

So, yeaterday i had a date with a guy who has a boyfriend. I went knowing about that, but he was so nice thati thought it woudln't hurt to go out for a coffe...Turns out it was possibly the best date of my entire life (21 here). He was super sensitive and at the same time strong, and he showedinterest about the things i had to say, which i find very important. After the coffe we went to his car and kissed. He said ""do you want to do the same as i do?"" and i said ""no, cause you have a boyfriend"". He smiled and started to drive. I thought he was driving me home, but he suddenly entered in a motel. I said i didin't want to, but he said i didn't have to do anything i didn't want to do, that we could just lay there and talk more. Obviously we had sex, and it was AMAZING. He was super gentle (bottom here) and hugged me and kissed me a lot. Most times a get insecure during sex, but he left me confortable. He had a dick that was no easy to take, and a usually prefer normal to small ones, but hemanaged to do work that inside of me, and it felt amazing, no pain. After sex we talked and talked more, and we told each other about our lifesand plans. He started then talk abou his relationship, and i saw myself giving him advice about that,         but what i really wanted is him to break up, haha, because i loved him...Now i'm just feeling weird...He has a boyfriend, and he's not very talkative by phone, so i can't tell if he wants to see me again...he said he wanted to. He got me and now i'm feeling weird, haha, i think i had never fallen for someone this quick. I don't really know what i want you bros to say, just wanted to write about it...Has someone been through something similar? How did it turn out? Hugs! =)

Update: Thank you guy for sharing your opinions! I realize i did wrong going on a date with someone who has a boyfriend. I don't feel good about that. On the other hand, i don't know, i just felt i would love going out with him. And i did! Now i pay the price, which is this uncertainty. I get that he cheating on his boyfriend is not something to admire, but somehow, he ended to be the guy with whom i could have this amazing open and fun conversation. I think maybe both of us needed this (not the sex, the talk).","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all, sorry for any english mistakes.

In case you're asking, I've tried and did it once or twice with a trans, and still can't get it off my mind. But, when it's a very masculine dude, it turns me off straight away, like from real hard to micro-size. Other than this abnormal behavior, I still have sexual intercourse with women most of the time normally. I just don't know why I have this kind of turn-on though.

Any advise is appreciated.
