Anyways, long story short:

Met this guy on Grindr a few times, he's older, massive cock, nice body, etc.  This past time(about 5 days ago), things were getting pretty hot and heavy. We used his sauna and fooled around in there for a little while.  From all the sweat, he accidentally slipped his dick in me and it hurt like all hell since I wasn't ready for it.  Had to take a break after that, so we showered and then headed up to his room to continue.  By then I was ready to go again. He breaks out the condoms and the astroglide and gets himself ready to top me.  Stung quite a bit, I'm assuming he tore a little something from the accidental slip in.  Eventually I got pretty into it, but had to stop because I felt an immense pain coming on.  We stopped, I topped him(safe of course), and then I left.

The next day my ass hurt and it hurt to wipe.  The day after that it was even worse: it hurt to sit down.  By then I was curious so I looked at my hole and noticed a rash surrounding my anus. That went on for another day or so and now it seems like it's starting to heal. It also doesn't hurt to sit down anymore.

What do you think caused this? Could this be an STD/STI?  Maybe an allergic reaction to the lube or condom?  Has this happened to anyone else before? Should I go to the doctor?

****

So since [my last post](http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/26h6uh/anxious_about_moving_and_getting_a_new_job/) I've managed to get a job in event sales and marketing, the company is fast paced and offers a lot of career progression; I applied for it earlier this week, got an interview on Wednesday, was asked to come back today for a second interview and to observe a small team at work on the field, then finally had a final third interview later on this evening.

I'm really surprised that I managed to capture a job within the space of less than a week but I reckon I got the job by the skin of my teeth because after my observation the guy who was in charge of it told me in private that he didn't think I was enthusiastic about the job. You have to bear in mind that he made me sit on a bench in the distance from them completing various mind-numbing tasks in my notebook for 9 hours, I barely got to talk to them other than when they took their breaks (they had A LOT of breaks, I had one) but when I tried to make conversation with any of them they didn't put any effort to make conversation with me and they expect me to be enthusiastic about the job when they'll barely interact with me?! Heck I tried to get closer and watch what they were doing but every time I did they'd sit me back on the bench and give me more shit to do!

I told the guy that if I didn't want the job I wouldn't of bothered travelling all the way there and that if I didn't seem enthusiastic it was because I was nervous with being somewhere I've never been before with people I've never met (wish I mentioned about their lack of interaction). So it comes time for my final interview with the Manager, he asks me various questions and all that jazz then brings the guy that was in charge of my observation today, tells me that it's because he *trusts* him so much that he's going to offer me a job, fuck was I shocked because it sounded like he wasn't going to offer me it. I said thanks to the Manager and the other dude walked me out, told me that I must want the job because I ""fought back"" when he said he didn't think I was enthusiastic about the job.

It's kind of made me feel shitty because it seems they don't feel confident in my abilities to do the job which is making me question myself, I guess I'll just have to prove it to them that I am capable for the job when I start in two weeks (hopefully I'll be working with people who'll actually put effort into interacting with me).

I'm still scared shitless about leaving my comfortable job to go into something entirely different but I'll need to hand my resignation tomorrow if I want to start this new job (I work part-time and my contract only requires me to give two weeks notice, even though hours are displayed three weeks in advance).

I've also been told that if I want to move into the new place earlier than August I can but I'm going to wait until I've gotten somewhat used to the new job before I decide to move down.

**TL;DR:** Applied, interviewed, and scored a job in less than a week but my new employers don't seem confident in my skills due to my observation today in which they made barely any effort to interact with me (when I made an effort to interact with them). I'll show them they're wrong to doubt me but I'm still shit scared of leaving my comfortable job.

Was also offered to move into new house earlier than the original date (August) but going to settle into my new job beforehand.

He proceeded to lambaste me with derogatory slurs and then hang up. Over the past few days they have sent various text messages explaining their disgust, shame and outrage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My fathers most recent one included not ever wanting to see me again unless I leave to study out of state (the hard part is I live with my parents due to financial reasons). My mother has ceased near all communication with me and both parents claim that they are emotionally dead in side due to my actions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been temporarily staying with my boyfriend who sadly is leaving in two days. I am at a loss as to what I should do. My boyfriend and I have been racking our brains to try and find a solution. Any help would be appreciated. I need my gay bros!&lt;/p&gt;

(Sorry guys.) 


To say I'm a frequent and present member of the Gaybros community is an understatement, and I have given out far more advice that I probably should have or solicited. But this is the first time I've come to you guys for some help.

Certainly coming out to Chinese parents is definitely not the most exciting and fun experience, but I'd consider myself pretty well versed in the questions that most parents have. I was hit with something I never considered before: 

""Given the risks of being in the gay population (HIV, Discrimination, other drawbacks), and the heartbreak and pain this has caused the family, why won't you consider not pursuing gay relationships and activities and living your life without it?""

It wasn't a ""You should marry a girl"" statement, and as a result I have no idea what to say.... I've said that I know that without the love of another person and without the ability to be and express myself, I'll be very unhappy, but besides that I have no idea what to say. 

Is this one of the situations where I stick to my guns and say ""I know that I won't be happy if I do that"", or is there another way to reason with them? I can certainly understand why they think that, they are engineers and to them, life is a big cost-benefit assessment. 



And for the record, this sucks. :(","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, this is a post related to my coming out to my Chinese parents. (Sorry guys.) &lt;/p&gt;

The first time was on Grindr last weekend..had my place to myself and I found a guy who said he'd come over and chill with some beers. After waiting for him for an hour I get a text that says ""I can't do this.. My boyfriend is in a cab on his way back"". I yell back ""You didn't tell me you were cheating, you douchebag."" And he responds ""Not cheating. I'm aloud [sic] to play. But not when it's our hang time"".

The second time was even worse.. I actually went out to a gay bar (which I hate) and for the first time in a long time managed to talk to someone there. We chatted for an hour and exchanged numbers. He texted me, we made plans, and I spent the whole week looking forward to having a hot date...until last night when I texted him to confirm the plans. I got his ""husband"". I apologized, and the husband said, ""It's alright. He deserves a little fun now and then."" I told the husband that I wasn't looking for ""fun"". 

I'm not opposed to open relationships, but I want to actually be *in* one, not a guest :). Isn't there an f-ing etiquette for letting guys know you're in a relationship before they think you're on a serious date?
