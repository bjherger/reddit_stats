First off, I rarely do hook-up, but I've done it enough times to know not to get emotionally attached to someone, especially if it's just about sex/a one-time hook-up.

I recently met this guy through Jack'd that I thought had an awesome profile and who I thought was really cute.  I honestly just wanted to make friends and see where it goes, but the first thing he asks was if I wanted to mess around.  Well, as it was sort of a bummer that his response isn't exactly what I was hoping for, who was I to turn down sex from a hot boy, so I agreed and I went to his house to pick him up.

While driving around looking for a place for privacy, we got to talking a bit and, not only he I thought he looked even cuter in person, but we had a lot of the same interest--I was seriously crushing on him.  

Sparing you guys from the details of the actual messing around (that's a different type of post for another day ;) ), I really wanted him to hang out with me more, and not only in a bootycall sense.  We exchanged numbers and I told him to contact me anytime he wants to chill, but I hope he really does, and not just when he's feeling horny.

Anyway, has anyone been in this situation before?

First of all, my last relationship was my first relationship; 10 years, first partner. It was a mess... I think I stuck with it because I have some serious self esteem and body image issues. (I could give you the backstory on why I think I am that way, but this is already turning into a textwall. Skip ahead to the TL;DR at the bottom if necessary!)


I'm really shy and backwards... to the point that even though no one knows who I am on Grindr, I'm still afraid to message anyone. Just plain terrified of rejection--3 years of Grindr and I've never been able to message anyone.


Fast forward to last night. Got a message from a guy pretty close, and for some reason, I found it in myself not to give a fuck for a change. Turns out the guy's pretty decent. We chatted a bit, he sent his pic without prompting. And holy shit, he's my type. Like, 90% of my Tumblr reblogs could be this guy. (Assuming his picture is him!) My knees are weak.


We're talking, I send my pic and tell him that I'm obviously chubby... And he mentions that he thinks chubby is hot! He has to go to bed, but says something like ""Good night, buddy. Maybe I'll fuck you sometime!""


Today he actually invited me down, and sent me a more intimate pic. FUCK. 


Holy shit, am I messed up over this! Here's my dream man, he totally seems into me, and my fucking MIND has to get in the way and tell me I'm not good enough, or that he'll see me in person and laugh me out the door... in which case I may actually die of embarrassment.) 


How does everyone do it? This is so intimidating to me. I have a hard enough time interacting with people in my day to day life, and now we throw in naked bodies? But on the other hand, this guy is literally all I can think about. I want to hit it, I really do. I just lack the confidence, I guess.


I don't want to lay this out for him, because I'm sure the last thing he's looking for in a casual lay is a neurotic crazy guy who sends 6 paragraph messages instead of nudes. *Real attractive.*


I've been relying on my closest friend for advice, she's so nonjudgemental and has the kind of live-for-yourself attitude I want. She's been great but... any advice from someone who has been there?

Thanks guys!!

We chatted a bit, he sent his pic without prompting. And holy shit, he&amp;#39;s my type. Like, 90% of my Tumblr reblogs could be this guy. (Assuming his picture is him!) My knees are weak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re talking, I send my pic and tell him that I&amp;#39;m obviously chubby... And he mentions that he thinks chubby is hot! He has to go to bed, but says something like &amp;quot;Good night, buddy. Maybe I&amp;#39;ll fuck you sometime!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today he actually invited me down, and sent me a more intimate pic. FUCK. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holy shit, am I messed up over this! Here&amp;#39;s my dream man, he totally seems into me, and my fucking MIND has to get in the way and tell me I&amp;#39;m not good enough, or that he&amp;#39;ll see me in person and laugh me out the door... in which case I may actually die of embarrassment.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does everyone do it? This is so intimidating to me. I have a hard enough time interacting with people in my day to day life, and now we throw in naked bodies? But on the other hand, this guy is literally all I can think about. I want to hit it, I really do. I just lack the confidence, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to lay this out for him, because I&amp;#39;m sure the last thing he&amp;#39;s looking for in a casual lay is a neurotic crazy guy who sends 6 paragraph messages instead of nudes. &lt;em&gt;Real attractive.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been relying on my closest friend for advice, she&amp;#39;s so nonjudgemental and has the kind of live-for-yourself attitude I want. She&amp;#39;s been great but... any advice from someone who has been there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks guys!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: My dream guy wants to hookup... my paralyzing fear of rejection/looking stupid is interfering. &lt;/p&gt;

I've been with my boyfriend for about 9 months now. The first couple of months were bliss, and we were as head over heels about each other as you could expect. Recently though, things have changed mostly because he is dealing with some severe depression / anxiety issues. He used to cope with these by smoking weed or drinking beer after the work day so that it could numb the feelings. 

Recently he has cut out both habits and started to go to group therapy meetings for those with substance abuse problems and mental health problems, but his depression doesn't seem to be getting any better. In fact, it seems to be getting worse. It's impacting our relationship in a severe way. It's to the point where he can barely get outside of his own head and lately I feel like I'm dating someone who empty. He's lost the spark he used to have. We're hardly intimate anymore, and he's no where as loving as he used to be towards me, although I know deep down he still cares about and loves me. I think he's just way too consumed in his depression to show it. I'm trying not to take it personally, but it's difficult. 

I'm trying my best to be strong for the both of us, and I've supported him for weeks. I can do this because my life aside for this relationship is not so bad. I have the regular stresses and problems that the average person would have but other than that I get by pretty smoothly. The only thing that brings me sadness is watching our relationship slowly decay. I love him very much and I want to build a future with him...I don't know whether I should continue to support him through this or if it's a lost cause and I should throw in the towel. I can't bare the thought of having to break up and lose my best friend, but he's not present enough right now to make me feel happy either. I feel stuck.

Are there any of you out there who have had partners that were struck with mental health issues and had to deal with it as well? Any wisdom would be greatly appreciated...

I started talking to this guy I met online back in June. We had our first date on the 4th of July (not seeing fireworks though :p) and we had a great time. Since then, we started hanging out about once a week, usually on weekends and we got along great. We clicked incredibly well. We have similar interests and personalities but with some differences that make it interesting. 

Early on, on one night, he mentioned that he wasn't looking for anything serious. I was fine with that at the time since it was pretty early on and learning about each other..but when we started hanging out a lot and talking everyday, I started falling for him. 

Towards the end of August I asked him if he was still not looking for anything serious. He said yes, because he got out of a relationship before he moved to the area and was confused about what he wants. I was honest in told him that how he acts towards me is totally different from what he says he wants. When we are together, we act like we are a couple but then he says he doesn't want to commit to anything.  I told him I wasn't going to be his tool to use to figure out what it is that he wants. He said he didn't see me like that or as a rebound, but still.

My friends told me I need to move on, which they are right. But I just can't really get over him. I made a mistake of getting lunch with him one day and he told me he was flying out to visit his old school (where he dated his ex) and all I heard from that was ""I'm going to visit my ex for a bit"" and was incredibly hurt. I didn't say anything to him about that but left shortly afterwords. 

We weren't official or anything, but he was someone I was hoping I would be able to eventually call my boyfriend. But I don't know what to do. I really want to move on and I've tried. I've hung out with friends, occupied myself with activities, even gone on some dates with people - who have all been great but I haven't felt any special connection that I have with this guy. There's a small part of me that hopes that something works out but realistically I know I need to move on, and that this guy is just using me because he just wants the feeling of companionship that's missing from his ex. But I just end up thinking about him everyday and it sucks. 

I guess my question is, what advice do you all have for me in order to move on? This is dumb but, should I move on? (The answer to that is probably lolyes)

TL;DR - I'm a mess :(

&lt;p&gt;I started talking to this guy I met online back in June. We had our first date on the 4th of July (not seeing fireworks though :p) and we had a great time. Since then, we started hanging out about once a week, usually on weekends and we got along great. We clicked incredibly well. We have similar interests and personalities but with some differences that make it interesting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early on, on one night, he mentioned that he wasn&amp;#39;t looking for anything serious. I was fine with that at the time since it was pretty early on and learning about each other..but when we started hanging out a lot and talking everyday, I started falling for him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of August I asked him if he was still not looking for anything serious. He said yes, because he got out of a relationship before he moved to the area and was confused about what he wants. I was honest in told him that how he acts towards me is totally different from what he says he wants. When we are together, we act like we are a couple but then he says he doesn&amp;#39;t want to commit to anything.  I told him I wasn&amp;#39;t going to be his tool to use to figure out what it is that he wants. He said he didn&amp;#39;t see me like that or as a rebound, but still.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friends told me I need to move on, which they are right. But I just can&amp;#39;t really get over him. I made a mistake of getting lunch with him one day and he told me he was flying out to visit his old school (where he dated his ex) and all I heard from that was &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m going to visit my ex for a bit&amp;quot; and was incredibly hurt. I didn&amp;#39;t say anything to him about that but left shortly afterwords. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We weren&amp;#39;t official or anything, but he was someone I was hoping I would be able to eventually call my boyfriend. But I don&amp;#39;t know what to do. I really want to move on and I&amp;#39;ve tried. I&amp;#39;ve hung out with friends, occupied myself with activities, even gone on some dates with people - who have all been great but I haven&amp;#39;t felt any special connection that I have with this guy. There&amp;#39;s a small part of me that hopes that something works out but realistically I know I need to move on, and that this guy is just using me because he just wants the feeling of companionship that&amp;#39;s missing from his ex. But I just end up thinking about him everyday and it sucks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess my question is, what advice do you all have for me in order to move on? This is dumb but, should I move on? (The answer to that is probably lolyes)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR - I&amp;#39;m a mess :(&lt;/p&gt;

Fast forward to a few weeks ago. I've graduated but he's still there. I message him again on OkCupid and tell him that I was interested in him but couldn't bring myself to ask him out. He responds, saying that he wishes I would've said something, then says thanks for telling him and I made his day.

My question for you guys is: Would it be out of the question to ask him about a potential online/long distance relationship? I'm about a 2 hour drive from the university. 

Or have I missed my chance at potentially dating him?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, I found a guy on OkCupid that went to my university.

I have always had a lot of body insecurities that have made me shy away from the gay/dating scene, that coupled with the fact that I was never confident enough to ""come out"" to anyone has meant that it has taken this long (25 years old) to finally be comfortable enough in my own skin to start seeing people.

The dilemma:
So after about 6 months of meeting up for coffees with a couple of guys, hooking up with one, I stumble across someone who I didn’t expect to find on Grindr. Someone I fell in love with. We dated for about 7 months before making anything official and we fell for each other. Which sounds pretty awesome right? Well it is. I’m unbelievably happy with this person and find it hard to believe I have found someone so incredible. The issue is this guy has been around the block...a lot. He’s been ""out"" since he was 14 and since then has had so many sexual experiences its unreal.

The reason this is a problem is not because I judge him on this, I envy him. I’ve had a tiny bit of fun with one person other than my boyfriend and its kind of heartbreaking that there was an entire experience in my past I’ve missed out on because of a lack of confidence. 

I love this guy and I cannot bear to loose him. But it’s eating away at me that there are experiences that he’s had that I haven’t. It sounds petty and sounds like I’m jealous because it is and I am. 

I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to loose this person, but I don’t want to have missed out on anything. Either way I loose.

Has anyone else been in this situation and if so do you have any advice?

*I really don’t want an open relationship, the thought of my boyfriend in bed with another person is something i couldn’t really deal with and would solve nothing*
