I'm having some post-coming out drama with my family, and I'd love to hear your perspectives!

I came out to my parents and my brother 2 months ago. Everyone in my family is a conservative, Southern Baptist -- I'm still fairly religious too. When I came out, they were loving and didn't condemn me. 

Their one admonishment was that ""I've been lying to them all these years."" They think I've been dishonest, deceitful and sneaky my whole life. 

I've been really close to my brother for the past several years -- he tells me everything about his life, including hookups and parties etc. -- and I am honest about everything...except the gender of who I'm taking home! He's the biggest bro; honestly one of the coolest people I know.

Out of the blue, my brother started accusing me of the same damning dishonesty. Yesterday, I woke up to my brother screaming expletives, saying I'm not his brother anymore, I don't deserve this family, ""I tell you everything about your life, but you don't tell me anything about your life,"" etc. etc. He started choking me out when I tried to leave the house. He thinks our closeness was a sham.

How do I explain that deferring coming out wasn't because I'm dishonest -- but because I wasn't ready and legitimately scared to do so?

Edit: thanks all for the comments. I'm gonna keep all your suggestions in mind. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey bros,&lt;/p&gt;

We ended up texting and I made sure it was him and not friends messing around with me. We ended up sending each other a couple pictures and talking about sexual stuff while we were both jacking off. He said some things like:

* ""I wasn't attracted to the guys I just don't mind dick""
* ""It's just when I'm horny""
* ""I like my dick getting sucked by them"" ""Sucked by guys? But not sucking on dick?"" ""Neither"" ""lol I'm so confused"" ""idk haha"" ""but you know I'm gay right"" ""Oh yeah I know"" ""so what are your intentions"" ""I'm just horny""

I'm just really confused, I told him we could talk and that whatever he tells me is 100% confidential.

So 2 nights a go I hooked up with a guy I met off grindr. I didn't really know him at all but just thought why not and went to his house. All we did was make out and oral with each other and I had fun. He was shall I say very enthusiastic when sucking me but it felt really good.

Anyway, today I noticed I have a pretty large purplish bruise kind of mark on the shaft of my penis about half way up. Do you guys think this is just a hickey or bruise from his hard sucking or could it be something more serious. I've never got it before but like I said he was pretty enthusiastic during it. I do have a pretty tight foreskin which can sometimes lead to a bit of pain if playing too rough but not sure if that is the cause.

To start things off, I'm closet gay, and I have no intention of really coming out in the near future.  This works for me right now, I'm totally happy with my life as it is, but sometimes I wish I had a friend who understood what I'm dealing with to really talk to.  I don't have any friends I'm willing to trust that much to keep my situation private, and any guys I've hooked up with are exactly that, just hookups.  Anyway, to get to the point, I want to find someone who I can be open with, talk about anything, and more than anything someone who can relate to my situation.

I feel like this is the community I can most identify with.  Hoping I can find someone worth getting to know and keep in touch with here.

I'm 22, skateboard, play hockey, sail, go to the gym like a mofo, and I'm in my senior year of university.  I'm really into music, mostly top quality hip hop, but really anything but country.  Obviously, I'm secretly into guys too.

Hope this is the right place for this, thanks a tonne","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey,&lt;/p&gt;

Recently I tried deep throating him again and the next day my throat was extremely sore as in muscle soreness which sucked because it would hurt to swallow anything even water x.x
He has a 9"" dick pushing 10"" which I love for when we fuck, yet when it comes to sucking him off it kind of becomes an issue. I know that deep throating isn't necessary; I can get him off fine without doing it. Yet he does it for me and will occasionally ask me to try for him (with no pressure), so I'd like to be able to do it for him too. Unfortunately, every time I do it for him my neck muscles are very sore the next day. So every time I do it for him I wait a week or two before deep throating again. 
If I keep trying to deep throat him will the soreness eventually stop coming? Would doing it more consecutively help my throat get used to it? Can my throat get used to it? Is there something that can be done to prevent the soreness before or after?
This hasn't been a problem in previous relationships because no one has been this big x)
I'd appreciate any advice 
Thanks
