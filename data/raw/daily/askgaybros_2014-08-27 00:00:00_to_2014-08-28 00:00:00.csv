He kept asking me really personal questions (like how often do you sleep with a guy), but I would not respond. 

He said he went to school with me, and named my school, and asked me to guess who he was. I refused to play games with him but then he finally told me who he was (call him X), and I was very supportive but told him to not be so intrusive and that I don't have any personal attraction to him. He then put pictures of himself up on Hornet and started talking to one of my best friends, who had no interest in X.

A few months later, I get messaged by a really hot guy (call him F1) who was asking me similar questions and trying to get my private pictures. He claimed he had never been with anyone, which got me suspicious. He unlocked his private pics and they did not even seem like him.

I did some digging and asked my gay friends if anyone knows of him, to which my best friend said he was messaging him and asking the same questions, and he to was suspicious of the guy.

Now this part may sound strange because we kinda did some stalking and managed to find his facebook picture and his account. His name did not match and the only mutual friend was X and another open gay friend Y. I talked to Y, asking who this person was, and he said the F1 guy was not gay, has a girlfriend, and lives far away.

I began asking 'F1' questions on Hornet, and comparing it to the info that Y had given me, and none of it matched. I called him out after he said I should respect him and unlock my nudes because he did it for me, and I said ""I dunno X (using his real name), why should I?"" to which he instantly blocked me.

I kinda let it pass, until two weeks later I got another hot guy messaging me and asking me the exact same questions as before. I asked my best friend if he had been messaged by him, and he said yes, and that he think it is X. I messaged X on facebook and told him to back off from me and my friend, and I blocked him.

A month later, another one. Same distance, same questions, and still messaging my best friend. Up to this point I had saved the front picture of all of these accounts, and I took screenshots of the conversations. I messaged more of my gay friends to give them a heads up of the fake accounts, to which two more of my friends had said they have been messaged and gave him their private pictures on Hornet.

Over the next month, it happened again.

At this point, I had to out him to one of my close friends who supported me when I first came out as gay, and she is close friends with some of X's close friends. She was very very pissed and confronts him herself.

A week later he is back on hornet with his pictures (the same as his original account, and the same distance as all the fake accounts) with the description 'straight', and tells me that someone is faking him on Hornet (which is total BS at this point), that he isn't gay, and that he has a girlfriend. I tell him I know he is lying, and not to ever message me again because I want this to be the end of it.

Just recently a new hot guy messages me. Same distance, same questions, and he tells me he knows which area I live in... which he gets correct.

I don't have direct proof that they were all X, but the evidence points towards it heavily. I have screenshots of most of the conversations and fake profiles. It has been about 2 years since I last saw him while we were in highschool. His family is very religious and so are his friends and his community, so I am trying to avoid outing him.

I don't know how to make this stop. Help :(

Just a warning: this is a rambling about my state of mind. I do not yet know where this post is going to go. 

I think I'm depressed. 

I've experienced depression before. I've been medicated, each time a massive failure. I don't think I want to be medicated again. I've had a lot of therapy in my past. I enjoy therapy, but it is no longer  a viable option. So for now, I guess I will use a forum as my therapist. 

Ever since I graduated college, I have not gotten out of bed before 10am. Recently, that time has been approaching noon. I try to say it's because my bed is so comfortable. Which it is. But I know that's not why. I stay in bed because I can't face the day which stands before me. When I finally do crawl out of bed, it is a shit show. I don't become productive until around 5pm. Even then, it only lasts an hour or two. 

I do not have a job. I am currently applying, but I do not have high hopes. I fucked up in college. I was on academic probation for 2.5 years until I was dropped from my major. Luckily, I then found a major I loved, and managed to pull a couple Dean's List semesters out of my ass. But my transcript is still shit. I feel I am much smarter than what it shows, but am I really? I mean, that is the whole point of a transcript; to show how capable one is. According to mine, the answer is not very. 

I had an opportunity with one company, but I fucked that up. I don't want to go into it. But it can't get it out of my head. Other opportunities have shown up, and I've done what I could, however I will be disqualified when certain elements of my past turn up (which is inevitable). 

I feel so dull. Maybe it's the beer I'm drinking. But I know it's not. 

After spending almost 5 complete years at college with the people I love, I've returned home. I have no friends here. 

Now to why I've posted here. 

I am gay. And this is definitely a large source of my depression. At 23, I have never had a boyfriend. And I am a virgin. Because of my family, I am terrified of gay sex. Every since I came out at 15, my mother has drilled into my head the horrors of AIDS. And now, whenever I finally feel something with someone, I become extremely afraid that they are lying about being negative, and I can't go through with it. Not to mention, I seem to lose interest in guys after I know they're gay. But that's another issue. To add insult to the injury, I just developed severe psoriasis, which makes me even more anxious to put myself out there. 

I also have a hard time vocalizing that I'm gay. I've been out for 8 years, and it still makes me feel sick whenever it comes up. I know it's ok to be gay. I even have a couple gay friends. It just makes me feel ashamed to say it in front of my family, and in front of myself. 

Well, my problem is I have obviously not come to terms with being gay yet. Combine that with being extremely lonely. Mix in some bleak future forecasts. Eh, I don't know what to do. Guess I'll lay in bed for 13 more hours. At least I know what the issue is now :/

Thanks for reading. Posting this somehow makes me feel better. 

TL;DR:  I think I'm depressed
Symptoms: Lethargy, Headaches, Amotivation, Fatigue, Hopelessness

Causes: Lack of self-acceptance, loneliness, poor health and diet

Cures: Getting over it? idk

&lt;p&gt;I do not have a job. I am currently applying, but I do not have high hopes. I fucked up in college. I was on academic probation for 2.5 years until I was dropped from my major. Luckily, I then found a major I loved, and managed to pull a couple Dean&amp;#39;s List semesters out of my ass. But my transcript is still shit. I feel I am much smarter than what it shows, but am I really? I mean, that is the whole point of a transcript; to show how capable one is. According to mine, the answer is not very. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had an opportunity with one company, but I fucked that up. I don&amp;#39;t want to go into it. But it can&amp;#39;t get it out of my head. Other opportunities have shown up, and I&amp;#39;ve done what I could, however I will be disqualified when certain elements of my past turn up (which is inevitable). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel so dull. Maybe it&amp;#39;s the beer I&amp;#39;m drinking. But I know it&amp;#39;s not. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After spending almost 5 complete years at college with the people I love, I&amp;#39;ve returned home. I have no friends here. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now to why I&amp;#39;ve posted here. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am gay. And this is definitely a large source of my depression. At 23, I have never had a boyfriend. And I am a virgin. Because of my family, I am terrified of gay sex. Every since I came out at 15, my mother has drilled into my head the horrors of AIDS. And now, whenever I finally feel something with someone, I become extremely afraid that they are lying about being negative, and I can&amp;#39;t go through with it. Not to mention, I seem to lose interest in guys after I know they&amp;#39;re gay. But that&amp;#39;s another issue. To add insult to the injury, I just developed severe psoriasis, which makes me even more anxious to put myself out there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also have a hard time vocalizing that I&amp;#39;m gay. I&amp;#39;ve been out for 8 years, and it still makes me feel sick whenever it comes up. I know it&amp;#39;s ok to be gay. I even have a couple gay friends. It just makes me feel ashamed to say it in front of my family, and in front of myself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, my problem is I have obviously not come to terms with being gay yet. Combine that with being extremely lonely. Mix in some bleak future forecasts. Eh, I don&amp;#39;t know what to do. Guess I&amp;#39;ll lay in bed for 13 more hours. At least I know what the issue is now :/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading. Posting this somehow makes me feel better. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR:  I think I&amp;#39;m depressed
Symptoms: Lethargy, Headaches, Amotivation, Fatigue, Hopelessness&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Causes: Lack of self-acceptance, loneliness, poor health and diet&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cures: Getting over it? idk&lt;/p&gt;

Instead of being like minded n taking it easy n move on, I totally freak out on them n insult them, I can't let go until they block me.

I have a big problem with guys ignoring me and I don't get where it comes from. I have to specify that I only go crazy when the guy that's ignoring me was once showing me interest.

I'm so sad guys, n I have no more self esteem after all those repeated rejections n the way I handle them makes me feel like I'm not strong enough to go through life as a gay man.

Recently, I've been subject to some bullying about my size, and it really cut deep.

**Instance 1:** I was in the crowd at the main stage of a large festival with a big group of ~50 gays (all people who I just met at the festival). It was late in the evening, and lots of making out, holding/dancing, and groping was happening. I started making out with a guy, and he put his hands down my pants to feel me up. Due to anxiety and unnamed substances, my penis was shrivel-mode. It was at most 2in. He gave me a good feel and looked at the guy beside us, giggled, and said ""small"". After that I felt cold and distant for a while.

**Instance 2:** I was walking down a crowded street after bars had closed to get food with friends. I'm wearing a normal pair of jeans. We encounter a bachelorette with her friends. She's drunk and playing a game where she has to do random tasks. I'm not sure what the task was, but she started looking at our crotches, and when she got to mine, she pointed and yelled ""That's a half-dick!"" Made me feel really low.

**Instance 3:** Talking with a not-so-close friend about random stuff. The topic of sex comes up, and the friend says that bottoming for a small dick is ""miserable"". I ask him what size he means by small, and he replied ""5 is tiny."" We continued to talk after that, but this triggered a really dark couple days for me. Hearing something like that from a friend was really disheartening.

**Instance 4:** Messaging a guy on one of the hookup apps. There is mutual interest. Then he says ""I only like hung guys"", and says that he won't sleep with someone unless they're at least 6in long. He didn't have anything like this in his profile because I wouldn't have messaged him if he did. I tried to fake acting tough/confident by replying ""Well I don't want to be with someone who doesn't like me for what I am, I'm 5.5."" He didn't reply, and despite my feigned toughness, I still felt bad about not being enough.

Now I should be somewhat immune to bullying since I'm gay, but these instances really stuck with me. Every time it happens, it triggers a deep, crushing sadness.

Well I did eventually find out that nope, not really my thing. So I ended up telling this guy I no longer have an interest with this stuff as I wasn't getting turned on as much as I thought and he was starting to get clingy, thinking of a future relationship and what not.  

So I cut off all communication with him and went my way. Did not have any contact with him from March up until two weeks ago. First day of class is back and I'm surprised I run into him at school, considering I didn't think he went. I just acknowledge him and nothing else. A few days later he sees me walking across campus and tries to get my attention. I freaked out because I literally did not want anything to do with him, and I continued walking to my class.  

I didn't see him again for another two weeks which is today (I think he is deliberately going out of his way to catch me on my way to class), but this time, he was really confrontational with me. He asked why I won't talk to him and I tell him I don't have anything to say to him and he asks why I even said hi to him, and I tell him just to be polite. Well I continue walking as I have class to get to and do not want to keep talking to him.  

After class is over, he sees me (like I said, I think its deliberate at this point that we aren't ""running into eachother"") and calls me a bitch because I ignore him and act arrogant and he isn't some punk ass that takes that shit. I tell him he is too hung up on this and I literally don't have anything to say to him nor do I even want to be the slightest of friends with him at this point. I continue walking at this point ignoring him and the last thing he says ""Next time, I got something to say and I don't care who is there to hear it.See you around.""  

I wouldn't care about the whole thing but I'm freaking out because I have a sibling that goes there whom I walk with sometimes, my family is super conservative, some friends go there, and I don't want this to start affecting my school and personal life.  

How should I handle this situation?  

TL:DR - Hook up with guy, ""dump"" him, see him months later, will not leave me alone.

So I ended up telling this guy I no longer have an interest with this stuff as I wasn&amp;#39;t getting turned on as much as I thought and he was starting to get clingy, thinking of a future relationship and what not.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I cut off all communication with him and went my way. Did not have any contact with him from March up until two weeks ago. First day of class is back and I&amp;#39;m surprised I run into him at school, considering I didn&amp;#39;t think he went. I just acknowledge him and nothing else. A few days later he sees me walking across campus and tries to get my attention. I freaked out because I literally did not want anything to do with him, and I continued walking to my class.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t see him again for another two weeks which is today (I think he is deliberately going out of his way to catch me on my way to class), but this time, he was really confrontational with me. He asked why I won&amp;#39;t talk to him and I tell him I don&amp;#39;t have anything to say to him and he asks why I even said hi to him, and I tell him just to be polite. Well I continue walking as I have class to get to and do not want to keep talking to him.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After class is over, he sees me (like I said, I think its deliberate at this point that we aren&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;running into eachother&amp;quot;) and calls me a bitch because I ignore him and act arrogant and he isn&amp;#39;t some punk ass that takes that shit. I tell him he is too hung up on this and I literally don&amp;#39;t have anything to say to him nor do I even want to be the slightest of friends with him at this point. I continue walking at this point ignoring him and the last thing he says &amp;quot;Next time, I got something to say and I don&amp;#39;t care who is there to hear it.See you around.&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wouldn&amp;#39;t care about the whole thing but I&amp;#39;m freaking out because I have a sibling that goes there whom I walk with sometimes, my family is super conservative, some friends go there, and I don&amp;#39;t want this to start affecting my school and personal life.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How should I handle this situation?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL:DR - Hook up with guy, &amp;quot;dump&amp;quot; him, see him months later, will not leave me alone.&lt;/p&gt;

I am not usually the type to post something to the internet. Usually what I want to said has already been said by somebody else in a manner several times more succinct than I ever could. 

I'm a junior at a fairly prestigious Liberal Arts school in Midwest America. This semester I am taking 5 courses as well as working two part time campus jobs and acting as a Teacher's Apprentice for a seminar of first year students. Both of my jobs have to do with technology and I have achieved the top rank possible for a student in those positions in record time. My work is very stressful, but I take pride in doing a good job and teaching the first years. I am maintaining a 4.0 grade average and am thinking about applying to graduate school for a master's in computer engineering.

So why do I feel so hollow?

At the end of last semester, I had a few friends, and three close friends. One of my close friends betrayed me by severely hurting a family member when we had a fight, and the other two have rebuffed any attempt I've made to spend time with them in the past two weeks. I have been coasting along by trying to get involved with other student groups and make friends through activities, but I either cannot commit to them due to time, or they have already found their clique and don't have any more room for people. 

I even inquired into joining a team through my school's (overfunded) athletics department, but many of the programs aren't going to start up for at least a month, and intramural teams here require you to make teams out of your pre-existing friends.

My romantic life has really sucked the past year. I keep going through cycles of trusting a guy I meet (whether in public, over OkCupid, or even on grindr), only for them to turn right around and tell me that they're not looking for anything too serious or disappear after I finally trust them enough to have sex with them. And this isn't oh-but-I-shouldn't 2nd date sex. This is after a month or two of talking to the person and getting a read on them. 

My campus is in the middle of a rural conservative heartland and I can literally count the number of gay men on campus on my fingers. The townies are freaking scary and messed up, so they are not an option. 

I'm not ugly, I don't look grossly overweight, and I clearly have a lot going on in my life. So why don't the people in my life care? 

Before you try to tell me that I am too young to want to find a person, consider:
I know that I am working hard to live my life as best I can and I embrace every part of myself and love who I am. I don't need another person in my life. I want one. 
I could live a life where I explored every nook of the world, solved every mystery, cured every disease, created as many songs and paintings as the Louvre could hold. But without someone to share the experience with, it would be nothing more than ash filtering through my fingertips. Placid. Dull. Nothing new, nothing fulfilling. The joy comes from seeing their eyes spark up, from watching their smiles and hearing their laughs. From holding their hand as you show them a new world and screaming for joy when they leap with you straight into it. 



Do any of you gaybros ever feel this powerless about your prospects?

I have a rather odd question. I've been with my boyfriend for 10 months now. 7 months into the relationship, we both got tested for STDs and HIV and the results were perfectly fine. My mouth had come in contact with his semen about 2-3 times and every time I had a slight burning feeling on my tongue or the inside of my mouth. We had been debating me making him cum in my mouth from blowing him but I wouldn't want to get an anaphylactic shock or a swollen throat and mouth that could possibly result in me struggling to breathe. (I may be a bit too dramatic)

Could I be allergic to semen? Any advise?
