We met at a club he liked and hung out with his boyfriend and friends.  I was tipsy so I left my car at the club parking lot and my friend drove us all home.

The night wound down, the four of us (me, him, his bf, and a friend) ended up goofing off in his bedroom (not a euphamism).  We all ended up falling asleep in his big bed.  In order, it was me on the end, then him, then the bf.

I woke up in the middle of the night around 4am and I was being touched.  Hands under my shirt, playing with my chest.  I froze, I didn't know what to do.  I like getting touched but it was really weird for me, because he has a boyfriend.  Then his hands started going down, and a rolled away a bit.  But it continued, and his hand slipped down and groped my dick and everywhere else.  

I started feeling really disgusted because of two prior experiences.  I started having flashbacks to a time in high school where a boy felt me up in a hotel room on a band trip when he thought I was asleep.  And I've been involved in some crazy negative drama with a guy in a relationship that made me really depressed for a year.  So here a guy is, touching me thinking I'm asleep, and he's in a relationship with the guy sleeping next to him.  I'm almost sick to my stomach and quietly slip out of the room to the living room couch where I have a mini panic attack.

I think about what just happened and realize what really occurred - he must have been asleep, and since he fell asleep next to his boyfriend on one side, he turned over in his sleep and thought I was him.  Then he got really intimate in groggy middle-of-the-night horniness, mostly asleep still.  But really it was me, and he didn't realize it.

I walked back two miles to my car in the middle of the night and drove home.  I didn't answer his call when he woke up and texted me asking where I was, but just texted back that my roommate locked himself out and I had to let him in.  His surprise at me leaving kind of proved my theory on what happened.

New user here, but long time lurker, with a quick question for you guys. 

 So a little background info, I'm 22, never dated a guy before (until now), not quite out but seriously considering it soon. My main experiences with dudes (and chicks) has been purely sex based, with no relationship really.

So anyways on to the story. I meet this guy at my college, we start talking for a couple months, and we officially met several weeks ago.  Over these weeks, I have developed feelings I never thought I would develop for him. He is great. He is pretty good looking and has one of the best personalities I could ask for. I now know what a relationship is all about, I deeply care about him. I had never felt this way about any girls that I have dated, not even close. We have been on a couple dates, and hung out at the local bars with each others friends. It's really nice.

He has introduced me to several of his friends (a majority of them being gay) and I did not care about hanging out with the ""out"" crowd. That is something I wouldn't have done months ago. So he is really trying to help me deal with coming out and being comfortable with myself.

So anyways, we have had several make out and cuddle sessions. They have been, by far, the best make out and cuddle session I have ever had. However, I cannot seem to keep it up. We have not had sex or anything yet, but while doing this he has a raging boner and I will be lucky if I get a semi for a little bit.  I have had this problem before, it doesn't happen most of the time though, maybe just over-thinking things, but it has never been this bad. I can usually get it up if I want, and when fapping I have no trouble whatsoever. Even though I really want it to stay raging hard like his, it just doesn't. This really embarrasses me and worries me to no end. He is accepting and it's not a huge issue to him, but I feel like a freak. It really worries me down the road, when we want to get sexual, that I won't be able to get hard. 

Do any bros have any tips/advice/similar experiences/possible fixes/ailments for this. Thanks for all the help guys! I love this sub, it has greatly helped me.

**Edit:** Sorry for the long block of text, I just felt it was necessary to tell my history, as that could be some part of the problem. 

**TL;DR- Met a nice guy, really like him, inexperienced with relationships with dudes, and have trouble maintaining a strong erection.**

We spend whole weekends together, and there are weeks where we've seen each other everyday--there is definitely an emotional connection there, and I'd like some sort of license to be more affectionate with each other. 
However, he's been seeing/hooking up with someone for a couple months, so if they're happy, it doesn't seem productive to add my feelings into the mix. The most we've settled on is that I'm jealous that he spend that time with this other guy.  

I thought that conversation might hint at my feelings, but I'm pretty ambiguous about things/not out, which realistically doesn't give him a whole lot of context for connecting the dots.  

It seemed unproductive to be infatuated with someone who's in a relationship, so I created some distance between us (went from talking constantly via every form of communication and seeing each other at least 3 times a week, to only running into him at an event/bar and going nearly a week without talking). He seemed really hurt by it--telling me that we can't not be friends and he can't understand why I don't like his boyfriend. He was clearly confused by the whole thing, so now I'm thinking, do I just tell him so that he understands and continue to create some distance? (and maybe on the off chance he has similar feelings, we go from there...) Or just get over it since he's taken, let him be none the wiser, and have a watered down version of the friendship we had before?

However, he&amp;#39;s been seeing/hooking up with someone for a couple months, so if they&amp;#39;re happy, it doesn&amp;#39;t seem productive to add my feelings into the mix. The most we&amp;#39;ve settled on is that I&amp;#39;m jealous that he spend that time with this other guy.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought that conversation might hint at my feelings, but I&amp;#39;m pretty ambiguous about things/not out, which realistically doesn&amp;#39;t give him a whole lot of context for connecting the dots.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seemed unproductive to be infatuated with someone who&amp;#39;s in a relationship, so I created some distance between us (went from talking constantly via every form of communication and seeing each other at least 3 times a week, to only running into him at an event/bar and going nearly a week without talking). He seemed really hurt by it--telling me that we can&amp;#39;t not be friends and he can&amp;#39;t understand why I don&amp;#39;t like his boyfriend. He was clearly confused by the whole thing, so now I&amp;#39;m thinking, do I just tell him so that he understands and continue to create some distance? (and maybe on the off chance he has similar feelings, we go from there...) Or just get over it since he&amp;#39;s taken, let him be none the wiser, and have a watered down version of the friendship we had before?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt; Have a crush on my good friend who&amp;#39;s gay and in a relationship. Want to either get with him or get over him. Does telling him solve anything or can I just ghost him for a bit til these feelings subside?&lt;/p&gt;

Just been in a pretty bad cycle for a couple months now I guess (well been aware of it for that long at least), where I do not feel like doing anything except sleeping and daydreaming or reading or doing something that keeps my mind distracted but is obviously not productive.

This is not the best mental state to be in while in university, obviously, and this last term was a bit of a train-wreck. Oh well, for some reason I don't really care (whereas usually I freak out if I get less than a 90), assumed motivation would renew itself over the summer. So far has not happened. 

It sounds pretty pathetic now that I write it out, but sort of stuck in this slump where I honestly just look forward to getting in bed and operating in whatever imaginary fantasy I can think up at the moment. It is rarely cohesive or realistic, but usually involves no school or responsibilities an unrealistically perfect boyfriend and lame romantic scenarios. The wonderful side-effect apart from the unhealthy time-wasting habit is that after concluding these mental adventures, remembering real life is obviously a big downer. 

I've read online that I should exercise, never really had the energy for it (which is probably because I never exercised to begin with, great cycle). I have told myself I will start, but that never happens (not to mention the fact that I am probably way too out of shape to do anything but some treadmill, and that will make me lose weight when I need to gain it).

Obviously romantic scenarios cannot happen given my closeted situation / cultural-family thing where the best option almost seems to be just biting the bullet and ending up getting married instead of destroying my family. Thinking about any of that makes me want to cocoon again. I just don't want to deal with any of this, and it is making me angry and depressed and frustrated.

Coming out is not an option because the cons far outweigh the pros, and unless I decide I suddenly hate my family and never want to see them again, I have to deal with this.

Been rambling a bit, but basically...how do I start functioning ""normally""? I am pretty fed up of this, and I tell myself I am going to start organizing my life and getting everything done and start what I need to start, but just end up in bed. Probably ruining my future as well by messing up university, not that I can really envision a realistically happy future anyway.
