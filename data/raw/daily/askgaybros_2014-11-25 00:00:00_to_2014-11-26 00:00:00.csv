I really don't know how to put this so I'm just going to ramble and hopefully those of you playing along at home will be able to follow.

So basically I'm 23, for the past 3 years I've been my families rock for lack of a better term being there for them emotionally and financially as much as possible.  We've had a very hard few years collectively as a family as well as individually as well.  

It all started when my parents business failed due to trusting the wrong so called friend to do their finances, this ultimately led to them losing the family home as well a 18 months later.  In June of 2012 my mum was involved in a car accident with a motorcyclist whom sadly passed away at the scene, she has been devastated since, PTSD and depression and anxiety plus facing a criminal court proceeding as well for the death of the motorcyclist because some young police prosecutor has a bee up his cunt and wants to make a name for himself.  In the meantime I started my own business with the hopes of being able to save some of my parents hard worked for assets, but I ultimately failed in doing this and have also landed myself in some serious shit financially as well.  Amongst all of this my grandfather died, whom I and my mum were close to and it hit us hard, and mum has been on a downward spiral with ever increasing speed ever since.  My mum also recently found out she may have at best a benign ovarian tumor, and worst ovarian cancer and requires immediate surgery.  This has added further strain to her to the point she has suicidal thoughts.  But it also has added more strain onto the family and myself.  My father's health is not great either he's lost 12kg in the past few months and a fuckload of strength and is constantly tired and worn out, we have a history of testicular cancer and prostate cancer in my family and we are concerned this may be what is wrong with him as well, but he refuses to see a dr.  I've spent the past 12 months attempting to run a failing business and find full time work in another industry to pay the bills.  I finally landed a job about 2 months ago at a law firm that pays okay, but it still doesn't cover all my expenses and leaves me having to couch surf with friends because I cannot afford to move out on my own, and my parents place is about 2 hours away from my work.  In amongst all of this I've been studying at uni, or rather attempting to but ultimately haven't passed any more than 30 percent of subjects since I began because I do not have the time nor energy to focus on all these issues at once.  

Today my mum called me during lunch I had a meltdown during lunch crying and having herself a little pity party ""why me?  im scared.  youre never here you dont love me anymore.  i want to kill myself.  etc etc etc.""  This ended up with me verbally abusing my mother and letting loose alot of pent up frustration, basically telling her that she needs to wake the fuck up and realise that she isn't the only one that is affected by all this bullshit, and that we all have to deal with it and we all have to live through it and that we all love her and have supported the fuck out of her and done everything that was asked of us and it's still not enough so she should check herself in to a psych ward because wondering if you'll get a phone call at any minute from the police or dad advising that she killed herself has gotten me to the point I no longer sleep and hardly eat and I visibly cringe/get anxious/feel violent sick everytime my phone rings.  And again she threw it all in my face saying I'm an asshole and don't care.  I hung up but was furious, hurt, frustrated and in a very dark place.  This resulted in me abusing some poor kid at Subway for fucking up my sandwich order and physically fought with another customer and 2 security guards for telling me to calm down.  I was escorted from the store by police, however the victims didn't press charges thankfully after I tearfully apologised and explained why I snapped, they took sympathy for me and made sure I wasn't charged.  

So now I'm sitting here numb.  I'm scared to let myself feel at the moment, I'm terrified of talking to my boyfriend because I've been treating him like shit recently without realising it and he's just taken it and been the loving, supportive guy that he is because he understands how much stress and pressure I'm under but I feel that's no excuse to treat or speak to him the way I have been.  He deserves so much better than that, than me and my fucked up family, but he persists on loving me and caring for me and supporting me.  This is the main reason I need help - I don't want to lose him, above all else he's the one thing that if I lost him I would be an inconsolable wreck.  I can't lose him and I can't hurt him anymore I feel like a piece of shit for doing so.  

I am a proud man, a stubborn man and a dumb man who has a hard time showing any weakness and asking for help.  But I have to, I need to, not for my sake, but for his.  Okay maybe for my sake to but ultimately for him.  He's MY rock and the one thing keeping me grounded.  I need him more than he knows or that I can express.
How do I ask for help?  My mother's psychologist has given me her number to call if I need help or support, but I don't feel comfortable speaking with her too much because alot of how I feel is quite negative toward my mother at this stage and I don't want that either affecting her treatment towards mum or to cloud her judgment of me.  I live in Australia if that's any help.

There was this guy I met at a summer camp in high school and semi-liked (before I really knew I was gay), semi-stalked on AIM and SMS. I think that understandably scared him away, so we basically lost touch. Anyways, we ended up going to the same university (one year apart in class year) quite some distance from home but had very little interaction the entire time. Now I've reached out to him again and we've been chatting. I came out to him and he basically had no reaction. I don't have facebook any more but his profile even years ago had nothing for 'interested in'. So yeah I told him I was gay and he didn't say anything. A fews later now I tried to ask him if he was gay. I explicitly said ""what is your deal? do you have one?"" He didn't respond to that. Since we don't see each other at all (live in different states but will have a brief few months where we'll be near each other), I guess this is going nowhere, but am I crazy for thinking that it could? He will probably be going to med school soon and I'll be going to grad school hopefully. however, the guy is smart and talented, cute, and I've known him for a long time (these are really high up for me). I want there to be something more. Is it clear that there won't be? I do not think he's straight bc most straight guys will say i'm straight if you ask them. I don't feel as if I'm romanticizing what it would be like with him. When I was younger, yes, but I'm thinking much more rationally. I'm afraid of scaring him off though. I do want us to at least be friends. What do you guys think?

tl;dr I like this guy that I've known for a few years. We only text. He knows my sexual orientation, but is really cryptic about his. Want to tell him I'm interested, but afraid it will make things weird. What's a good way to proceed?

I want there to be something more. Is it clear that there won&amp;#39;t be? I do not think he&amp;#39;s straight bc most straight guys will say i&amp;#39;m straight if you ask them. I don&amp;#39;t feel as if I&amp;#39;m romanticizing what it would be like with him. When I was younger, yes, but I&amp;#39;m thinking much more rationally. I&amp;#39;m afraid of scaring him off though. I do want us to at least be friends. What do you guys think?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tl;dr I like this guy that I&amp;#39;ve known for a few years. We only text. He knows my sexual orientation, but is really cryptic about his. Want to tell him I&amp;#39;m interested, but afraid it will make things weird. What&amp;#39;s a good way to proceed? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Thank you guys for the feedback thus far. I took it as a bit harsh at first, but it was genuinely helpful for me to go through these thought processes. &lt;/p&gt;

So, as the title says, I'm kind of new to the whole ""you are gay and capable of interacting with other gay men"" thing.  I just moved into my dorm in September and found it difficult to meet other gay people on campus besides the ones already in my hall, so I downloaded Grindr.

It was pretty shitty and I uninstalled it relatively quickly, but before I did, I met this one guy who's essentially a more handsome version of my long-time high school crush, but also gay.  I went into full infatuation mode and struck up a conversation; luckily for me, he was pretty friendly and never really seemed to mind me striking up conversations so often.

Now, the problem is that he has a pretty busy schedule (job + school + miscellaneous things) and so he doesn't really have any time to meet up in person until winter break (we've yet to meet physically).  I'm perfectly cool with that, but the issue is that I feel like my crush has ebbed a little bit, and now that I don't have the rosy lenses on, I can't tell if he's legitimately alright with talking to me or if he's too nice to tell me to leave him alone.

I mean, he was pretty swift in handing out his number when I told him I uninstalled Grindr and has apologized the one time it took him a long time to text back.  He also responds relatively quickly whenever I say hi on League and the conversations never necessarily feel flat, but as the saying goes, ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.

I feel like being straightforward and just asking if he doesn't mind me or if he wants me to unhook my talons, but at the same time, I don't know if that'll give off the feeling that I'm searching for self-affirmation or something.  Who knows?  I dunno, that's why I'm asking.

*TL;dr - Want to come out but scared of the consequences with my family, best friends, newer friends, and other acquaintances. Help* 


So for me it is a quite complicated situation. I am 19, m, no one knows about me.

I spent my whole schooling in Asia (international school) and made it back to my home in the UK for university (in my first year). Because of this I have lots of friends that are now all over the world and I am starting to make quite good friends at uni. Not coming out in highschool wasn't so much of a bother, but now i see people in serious relationships; conversations about girls are getting too real and awkward for me. I've been thinking about coming out but I am quite scared and nervous. So there are several reasons for that and i will make a massive list (sorry):

* **Family**: I think my dad would be alright with it. My mom is religious and thinks that its a choice, she doesn't really accept that ""choice"" (because of the bible and all) but she is quite close friends with a lesbian couple and she does judge people more on their personality despite resenting the fact that they are gay. I'm most afraid of what she might say or do, I don't want to 'let her down' for lack of any better words. What have been some of your experiences telling your parents?
My brother doesn't really have gay friends, but he doesn't mind gay people, just not &gt;""the over-the top gays"". 
Not sure he'll learn to accept it and I kind of look up to him so I don't want him to look at me differently or lose our bond. What happened when you told your siblings? My grandparents are getting quite old and they have very limited views (racist, sexist comments etc) so I don't think I'll tell them. Should I?

* **School friends**: So I was at this school since kindergarten. Made some of my best friends there and a lot of them study in America or Asia so I won't see them in a while (maybe even 2 years). I am possibly the most terrified of telling them. I've been friends with some of these people for over 6 years and I love them so much. I dont want them to change the way they see me and if some of them rejected me, I don't know what I would do without them. How would I come out to them? message them individually? group chat with only my best friends? skype? I really don't know. I'm also quite scared of the whole grade finding out (over 100 people, about 20 of which i used to talk to on a daily basis, 7 best friends I would die for), I don't like being judged and I know a lot of people will talk about me. 

* **Uni friends**: these are newer friends so i guess it could be easier. However, we have just sorted housing and we've already looked at a couple houses to live in next year, what if some of the people in my house won't be okay with it? How awkward and uncomfortable would that be? And how do I tell them? Do i gather a mass of like 10 people and tell them together, or only tell the 2-3 closest friends I've made?

So when would be the best time to come out and what would be the best way? Who should I come out to first? My family?

**Bonus questions:**

* Have some of your best friends/ family rejected you? and how have you dealt with it?
* What have people said about you after you came out? How did it affect you, what did you do?
* When your entourage found out, did people tend to look at you different or talk about you? (I'm imagining this high school movie thing about girls looking at me, whispering to each other and laughing hahahah)

I've thought about coming out, recently thinking of all this^ and the consequences keep me awake at night longer than I'd like. Just thinking about writing this post took weeks of deliberating in my head. I'm really indecisive and scared that when the moment comes I'll pussy out.

Help me out gaybros. I've been reading this sub recently and you guys seem great. If you made it to the end, special love for you &lt;3

Alright well it's late and I'll try sleeping (after all the adrenaline from writing this post, I really hope I will), I'll see what you all posted tomorrow and try to answer any questions. Also I wrote this quite fast and panic-y, so sorry if some things are unclear/confusing but feel free to ask any questions for clarification.

WARNING : WALL OF TEXT


I just wanted to vent/get input from people. 
I dated a guy for a short while back in my freshman year of college and it was nice. He was my first boyfriend ever. I had never kissed anyone before then, nor had sex. He was the first for both. But about a month after he said he had the ""cold sore virus"" which I knew to mean herpes but in a nice way. He said he'd never had symptoms. After about a month I started getting a fever and a sore throat. I didn't think anything of it.
A week goes by and I see the doctor, she's concerned that my sore throat hasn't gone away. She screened me for STD's and I come up positive for HSV-1 (Herpes Simplex Virus type 1). Great. She informs me the that now I will have theses recurrent sores, but not like normal people, I will have them in my throat. It's because I legitimately had a sore throat before and then the virus seized the opportunity to infect that area. It wasn't fun dealing with that the first couple months. Coming to grips with what is now a lifelong virus that will reoccur whenever the hell it wants. But i could have lived with that.
About 5 months after my initial diagnosis (We had broken up for some time, and not because of the cold sores) I started getting sores around my genital region as well. Apparently its rare but you can get simultaneous infections of both regions where herpes commonly reside at the same time if you don't have any antibodies built up. 
It's been now about 2 months after that and I still can't deal with this. At the risk of sounding overly dramatic, I have just given up. I lived most of my life in the closet, miserable in a rural part of Wisconsin. When I finally moved away and came out I felt free for the first time. Now, once again, I will have to Re-come out of every one of my sexual partners for the rest of my life. I'm so sick of this. I honestly have just decided not to deal with relationships of any kind and resigned myself to being alone (Relationship wise) for the rest of my life.

Yes, I realize herpes in theory isn't that huge of a deal. But with the already limited selection of men that are gay, I have now an even slimmer margin of whom that will be okay with my condition.
I will also never be able to have a time of my life where I can sleep around. That door is now shut before it even has been opened.

I am thinking of seeing a therapist, but i'm not crazy, i'm just defeated.
Any advice would be great.

Thanks Guys

Me (21) and my fraternal twinbrother have  been quite close for as long as I can remember. 

I've always been very outgoing, social and loud (very loud). While he has always been a little shy and quiet. He also was the first person I ever came out to, and together we've always been a great team.

But this year I finally got accepted in medical school (after years of struggling) , and I had to move. I still go home on most weekends though.

But ever since I moved, my brother's been really upset and he's taking most of it out on our parents. My mom can be really overbearing sometimes but I don't think she deserves the shit my brother's giving her.
And so far my bro hasn't told my father personally that he's been recently seeing a therapist. My father knows of course that he actually does and it really disappointed him that he didn't tell him.

My brother has been bullied in middle school and that changed him. However I did tell him that if he wants to do something about his situation, he should first work on changing himself. He replied with something like ""I'm only seeing that therapist because it might make mom stop crying all the time. She's only making it worse.""

Now I think that's bullshit, he's only seen her twice and I said that if he isn't being honest with the therapist, it won't do anything. My mom is really afraid he's going to move out as well. And when that happens that he either is going to isolate himself, or develop a drinking habit. I always thought that was paranoid but now I'm not so sure myself. My bro spends a lot of time gaming and going out to have drinks, and he had to fall behind a year in his studies.

Any advice on how I can help him?

TL;DR
Bro got depressed after I moved out for uni. He's been taking it out on our parents which I think is unfair. And now he doesn't wanna go to therapy anymore.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So a little backstory first.
