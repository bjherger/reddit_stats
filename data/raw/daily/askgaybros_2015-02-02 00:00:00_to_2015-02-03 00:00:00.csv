I'm a mostly closeted gay and this friend of mine is straight.  We knew each other for about 6 years as I got to know him from a summer rec program.  We clicked and got pretty close.  Then last summer he was old enough to work there (and of legal age).  Gradually we got closer and even hung out outside of the program.  During all this, I started having these funny feelings towards him, like I knew we could be something more.  The feelings were inappropriate and I tried to push them away, but I just couldn't. 

 He became more distant on top of that, blowing me off more (this was when he at first didn't notice my feelings) and it was getting me upset.  I called him out on it and he didn't seem to show much sympathy towards it.  Down the road, he eventually realized how I felt about him and he wasn't interested, but saw that I was always upset around him, especially at work (yes, this is where I fucked up).  He got even more distant From me at work and I tried to save the friendship, but the feelings also got in the way.  If you're wondering, I never tried to get physical with him.

After the program ended I apologized for everything and he then blew up and told me he couldn't deal with me anymore and it was weird to want to do something with him at his age (im in my 20s btw) and the fact that it was with someone I worked with.  He cut me off social media, I was upset but tried to move on.

Couple months later I messaged him just to try to fix things and he told me not to talk to him because that will only make it worse.  A couple weeks later, I found out I was excluded from a summer rec program staff reunion, and I had a suspicion that this guy told my bosses that I was acting inappropriate over the summer.  

Sure enough, I spoke to the head honcho about what happened, and he said he couldn't hire me back next summer and tried his best to keep me.  He didn't go into details, and I was also still mostly closeted at the time.  He said he doesn't want us to burn bridges and will recommend me to anywhere I apply to for the future.  The second in command however unfriended me on FB and was in charge with organizing the reunion.  Meanwhile this female second in command has had a history of hooking up with workers, and she can get away with that, yet I couldn't for not even doing a 10th of what she's done.

So for a short period of time I was depressed and kept wondering what if this got out.  I tried to play it cool and ended up booking a trip for the summer with some friends this year.  To try to move on.  Also, after New Years I sent my ex friend a text telling him I understand he did what he had to do and that I forgive him for it, and that i have no grudge towards him.  Go figure he didn't reply.

So now to the issue of being confused whether or not I want to restore this friendship.  I really wish this guy would at least admit to me what he did without any warning and we would have a mutual closure.  I don't know if he has a reason to apologize or not, but after half a year for some reason he is still on the back of my mind.  Is there anything else I could do besides wait and move on in this situation?

I ended up giving him a chance to develop something and I found out he actually really cares about me, something I wasn't really expecting after so many frustrated dates.

So like the title suggests, I have a question about HIV infection. Now this might seem paranoid, but I hope you bear with it and give me some advise.
I am in a 10+ year relationship and have never had sex with anyone else other than my partner. That change about a week ago. I met up with this guy, and at first I insisted that there will be no penetration, no BJs. We talked a bit before beginning and the HIV talk somehow got picked up. He told me some stories about the behaviour of his friends endangering themselves with unsafe sex and he is quite against it. He also has check ups every 3 months and his doctor is good. I have a feeling he can be trusted.

During sex, we kissed, there were blow jobs and in the heat of the moment he began rubbing his dick against my ass and very briefly stuck his penis head in my hole, but really just the tip. So I told him to stop, which he did immediately and we finished off ""conventionally"" with our hands.

So I know the basics of contracting HIV. As in you cant get it via kissing and we were not visibly wounded. The ""penetration"" was sorta non-existant and I realised he did not have any precum. Logically I believe I am just being extremely paranoid but what are the chances really of catching anything like this? I will be going for a test in 2 weeks, but before that, I am semi-worried. Would be thankful for any insight.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear gaybros.&lt;/p&gt;

Began experimenting guys from my college who'd post randomly on Craigslist (Lets meet at the tunnel way in the basement of the library).
I grew up in a country side and was totally new to this school (which was in the suburbs of a big city).

One of the guys(Mr.Chub) I met at my first camp organized by my college fraternity came out to me one fine morning at 4am noticing my morning boner. The campsite was down south in Florida (hot and humid) and had no fans, we barely wore only underwear or boxers and literally drenched in sweat. I being a little hairy adds more to it. Mr.Chub who at that time was 20 years of age, seemed to be erotic and very sensual. He was huge {not his d :( sob}, 6'2"" and 250lbs with a deep manly voice. I get easily aroused when someone's voice is hoarse, deep and with a kinky baritone. He sat near me while the other guy in the same tent was deep in sleep and fidgeting his morning wood. Mr. Chub was shy initially to take of his tanktop as he was too embarrassed with his supple moobs(manly boobs). As he sat close to me and trying to reach his hands as close to my willy, I started sweating profusely. I was horny, nervous and speechless as I knew the intentions of Mr. Chub. This being one of my first experience and also in public, I was getting terribly scared and my boner was getting close to being flaccid. To calm down a little bit I drank some cold water from the icebox to regain my tranquility. ""Hurry up, we don't have much time to waste before the officer sends the wake up siren call"" said Mr. Chub.

Act begins:
I would just lay on my sleeping bag with a comforter and Mr. Chub starts to slurp my *d* vigorously without starting it slow. He was giving a good head, I guess his previous experiences have made his mouth a good pussy. I hadn't jerked off in like 4 days then and I was at my prime peak age when I could keep fapping endlessly and squirt the thick teeny young cum almost a meter ahead like a jet, 4 times in a day. There was quite a huge load inside my ball sack. I couldn't prolong and hold it for more than 2 mins. Right away I ejaculate in his mouth and he swallowed it all. I thought, now he'd ask me to suck his *d* which he didn't. He went on licking my hairy nuts, my happy trail, my taint and started to sniff and lick my dingleberry between my ass cheeks. I felt very ticklish at this time and couldn't control making sounds of pleasure (i wouldn't call it moaning). He then navel fucked me with his tongue and buried his fat face between my hairy muscular teeny ass cheeks. After deep throating for 7 more minutes, I ejaculated a lesser viscous pleasure ecstasy in his mouth for him to get enough protein for the day. If I didn't let him stop, he'd demand for a third one, the glutton was so hungry for my juice.

He then went out to take a leak and got back to the tent and it was almost nearing 5am. Our camp in-charge would be sending the wake up call anytime. I was curious to explore him and pulled his boxers down and took his tanktop off. Wow, he was as smooth as silk, no hair in the body except for armpits and a stubble like pubes. It was dark at the time and I was searching for his dick.

Climax:
Man!! Mr. Chub had good sized balls, but the micropenis was hidden under the pubes and a thick layer of pubic fat. the pubic fat looked like a second belly. It was a put-off for me. He had to compress and pull his pubic fat skin up to get his penis show up a bit. Dang, it must have been barely 1.5"" in length. Darker than mine, but hidden inside a cave (manhole pussy). He taught me cock-docking as he had some skin. After 7mins of docking he came and man it was a big load on my *d*.
I wanted to fuck his manhole pussy while sucking his supple nipples from his moobs, but as fate would call it the wake up call came.
We had to get into our uniforms and leave.
After 9 years, I still want to meet that Mr.Chub. Thanks to him for making me a real gay! Hurray!

I still pity that guy r/micropenisproblem.

There was quite a huge load inside my ball sack. I couldn&amp;#39;t prolong and hold it for more than 2 mins. Right away I ejaculate in his mouth and he swallowed it all. I thought, now he&amp;#39;d ask me to suck his &lt;em&gt;d&lt;/em&gt; which he didn&amp;#39;t. He went on licking my hairy nuts, my happy trail, my taint and started to sniff and lick my dingleberry between my ass cheeks. I felt very ticklish at this time and couldn&amp;#39;t control making sounds of pleasure (i wouldn&amp;#39;t call it moaning). He then navel fucked me with his tongue and buried his fat face between my hairy muscular teeny ass cheeks. After deep throating for 7 more minutes, I ejaculated a lesser viscous pleasure ecstasy in his mouth for him to get enough protein for the day. If I didn&amp;#39;t let him stop, he&amp;#39;d demand for a third one, the glutton was so hungry for my juice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He then went out to take a leak and got back to the tent and it was almost nearing 5am. Our camp in-charge would be sending the wake up call anytime. I was curious to explore him and pulled his boxers down and took his tanktop off. Wow, he was as smooth as silk, no hair in the body except for armpits and a stubble like pubes. It was dark at the time and I was searching for his dick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climax:
Man!! Mr. Chub had good sized balls, but the micropenis was hidden under the pubes and a thick layer of pubic fat. the pubic fat looked like a second belly. It was a put-off for me. He had to compress and pull his pubic fat skin up to get his penis show up a bit. Dang, it must have been barely 1.5&amp;quot; in length. Darker than mine, but hidden inside a cave (manhole pussy). He taught me cock-docking as he had some skin. After 7mins of docking he came and man it was a big load on my &lt;em&gt;d&lt;/em&gt;.
I wanted to fuck his manhole pussy while sucking his supple nipples from his moobs, but as fate would call it the wake up call came.
We had to get into our uniforms and leave.
After 9 years, I still want to meet that Mr.Chub. Thanks to him for making me a real gay! Hurray!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still pity that guy r/micropenisproblem.&lt;/p&gt;

I apologize for the length. This is a throwaway for obvious reasons. I need some advice, bad.

I have had a best, straight friend for about 7 years now. We are very deeply close. We have both had some very hard things to deal with over the years, and have always been there for each other. Me a rough coming out, a cancer scare, failure in school, a car accident, loss of my mother, and a major change in career path. Him an abortion he didn't want, inability to hold a relationship together after that, unclear career path, parents' divorce, drug abuse in the family, crazy ex causing legal issues, and actual cancer. It's been a rough last few years for both of us...but the one stable thing we both have had is each other. He is my brother. My best buddy. Hell, we are closer to each other than our actual brothers. 3 am and I need to talk, and he's there. And the other way around too.
The problem is, I love him. I mean yeah, we have both said I love you to each other. Just as a family member would say, platonicly.....but I love, love him. I want more.

He already knows I find him sexually attractive. We discussed it, and I couldn't have asked for a better response. Essentially he said that he knew I couldn't control who I found attractive, and that he felt flattered. And of course, as friends, we both knew what is and is not appropriate, and left it at that. No harm, no foul. This was years ago, friendship was not affected at all. Occasionally he will poke fun of it even. For instance, one morning he woke up and walked past me in his boxers with uh well you know, morning male heightened attention . He just stopped, laughed at me, and said ""don't pretend to not look, I know you're going to either way because you're my little homo.""
So cool, on that front he knows I can't help it. But it's not even necessarily a sexual desire I have. I want to be with him the rest of my life. And frankly I am jealous of his current girlfriend. I find myself thinking ""I've known him longer than you, I know more about him, why can't I have what she has with him?""
Sometimes I do have that. When he has been between girlfriends, we somewhat fill that gap for each other, as I have been single the whole time. Multiple phone calls a day. Seeing each other nearly every day. Emotions.....but ultimately once he has a new girlfriend that gap is no longer needing to be filled. We are still close, but not as close. And that hurts.

Here's the big kicker though.....he's shown some big signs of being gay but repressing it very hard core. The first girlfriend of his broke up with him because she claimed she found gay porn on his computer and craigslist ads of his in the m4m personals. She was a bit crazy, so I thought nothing of it. Until he borrowed my computer. He left his email setup in the Apple mail app. I thought it was my mailbox and went through the sent box looking for a craigslist posting I had made to sell a phone. There they were. Several conversations back and forth, including pictures, of him making plans for hookups with guys. Most of them saying he was;t out as gay, or wasn't out as bi (depending on who he was talking to) and to keep it on the DL. Immediately I thought back to some situations we've been in that maybe, maybe could pass as just being really close friends, but I don't think a lot of straight men would be OK with. Showers together at the gym (for some reason for guys our age in our area this just isn't a thing. Too ""gay""), we don't wear pants when hanging out, cuddled while sharing a bed (not by choice), going to Pride together every single year without fail. One pride weekend after a few drinks he took my hand and had be get a feel of his c&amp;b's. I had originally shrugged all this off as someone who likes to joke around and is just very confident in being heterosexual. Now I question it all after what he left behind on my computer. I even let myself question whether maybe some of his actions towards me, my well being and struggle to live a healthier lifestyle were maybe for him as much as they were for me. Maybe he wanted me. I shrugged those off, and determined that flattering myself would just end up being painful or embarrassing,

At one point I flat out asked if he is gay. He said no and gave some reasons which I do not recall (this was also after some drinking). And goes to great lengths to show he isn't. He has a girlfriend. He seems very happy. And I am happy for him. Even here though, there are red flags. He is trying what appears to be way way too hard. Trying to show he loves her to an extreme extent.

Meanwhile I want him. So so so bad. I would marry him. And I'm not sure what to think. I don't want to get my hopes up that he will ever come out. Even if he does, I don't want to assume he would want a relationship with me. Maybe he's not gay but very curious or very confused. But above all, I don't want to fuck up an amazing friendship and brotherhood with him. But it hurts so bad to keep it in and know I may never have more. I think it may feel better to just get it off my chest. I am tempted to tell him this, and our previous discussion about sexual attraction may indicate that he will just accept it....but maybe not. I don't know what to do.

Which is not a lot of time, but I started pretty far in the deep end. I have a Master and Sir, who are a married couple (in their 30s). We live very far away from each other, but I recently went to serve them as their live-in slave for a two week period, and that was really my first serious kink experience. 

I loved absolutely everything about it. Everything clicked. The three of us had amazing chemistry. When things got rough, I was dedicated to taking it for them. When they showed me affection, I was ridiculously happy. Ridiculously happy doesn't begin to describe it adequately... But it was amazing, and I was where I was meant to be. They feel similarly about me. Everything was just so right.

So I am still obviously serving them, albeit, remotely. I've another trip to see them in about 2 months. They've talked to me about the possibility of collaring me, and how I feel about that. What it means... the commitment involved. It sounds GREAT to me. I feel that connected to them already.

However. They are a married couple. I'm a single, recent college grad. Neither of these men are playing the role of boyfriend or husband for me. They are my Doms. They might eventually be my Owners/Handlers. But they're not my boyfriends. They also want to completely avoid any kind of discussion about making this a full time thing until A) I get some more experience with BDSM with them and B) I finish grad school, and get a start with what I'm interested in career-wise. We all agreed, this relationship should compliment my life, not derail it. 

So I'm sort of at a loss with how romantic relationships work in these situations. I love these guys so much. But they aren't romantic relationships. They are tender, affectionate and loving at times, but they're not my boyfriends. But I feel like it's going to be VERRRRY hard to date, and maintain this relationship. 

**QUESTIONS:**Does EVERY potential bf need to know right out of the gate that I'm super committed (and maybe collared) by two doms? I've dated before, and never even told guys about my interest in kink... This seems to make it unavoidable. Is it even POSSIBLE to date and be owned at the same? Do I need to put a love life on the back burner if I'm committed to these men? They offer a definite, committed, fulfilling relationship. I'm getting so much from them, and really have NO interest in losing it to go back to dating around... But I don't want to be released in my 30s and realize that now I have no one, either.

If anyone is involved with this stuff... I'd really just like to talk a bit about how this sort of stuff at least... can work out. I've discussed it with my Master a bit.. and he assured me that if I ever find a guy I want to date, he will support me and not get jealous.. But that's not really my concern, but I don't want to push it too hard and make it seem that I'm antsy to get out. I'm not, I'm just new at this, and predisposed to looking way too far ahead. 

**TL;DR: I serve two men. I like them very, very, very, VERY much, but they're not boyfriends. Can I date and have a BDSM relationship at the same time, and if so how?

I'm having this recurring problem that's driving me mad. I frequently have encounters on grindr or elsewhere that go nicely, and when we talk about getting together, it often comes down to neither of us being able to host. So we effectively have no where to bang, like we're sex orphans. Everybody is a broke millennial who either has a hundred roommates packed up their asses at all times or are living with their parents who would not take kindly to the sound of earthshaking buttfuckery emanating through their house as they watch the news. 

This shit sucks bros. I feel completely crammed and unable to breathe. Of course there is the prospect of Hotels, but for one thing people are stingy--if they had money to toss out this wouldn't be the problem in the first place--and for another I live in a city where the hotel prices are jacked up. 

The last alternative is of course the ole' kinky public sex route. It's equally hot and gross, and I don't think I would be opposed to it if it was one of those ""if a tree falls in the woods and nobody is around to hear it?"" situations. It's always been a fantasy of mine to bang in the woods or in nature, but right now it is too cold for that.  

Does anybody have an experience with this kind of situation? I'm not going to be able to afford my own place for quite some time, so the prospect of just moving on up is not in the cards. I would feel like a wretched whore banging in bathroom stalls, and I'm not sure I want to associate with the kind of dudes who would eagerly assent to such activities.

Of course there is the prospect of Hotels, but for one thing people are stingy--if they had money to toss out this wouldn&amp;#39;t be the problem in the first place--and for another I live in a city where the hotel prices are jacked up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last alternative is of course the ole&amp;#39; kinky public sex route. It&amp;#39;s equally hot and gross, and I don&amp;#39;t think I would be opposed to it if it was one of those &amp;quot;if a tree falls in the woods and nobody is around to hear it?&amp;quot; situations. It&amp;#39;s always been a fantasy of mine to bang in the woods or in nature, but right now it is too cold for that.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anybody have an experience with this kind of situation? I&amp;#39;m not going to be able to afford my own place for quite some time, so the prospect of just moving on up is not in the cards. I would feel like a wretched whore banging in bathroom stalls, and I&amp;#39;m not sure I want to associate with the kind of dudes who would eagerly assent to such activities. But a man needs to have his needs met. What to do?&lt;/p&gt;

Anyway, I'm feeling pretty shitty after another lonely weekend.  It seems like it'll be impossible for me to ever get into a relationship or even have gay friends because of the following:

* I'm not out of the closet to my parents and couldn't ever imagine bringing a guy home
* I don't have any social life to speak of
* I hate the taste of alcohol, so I feel uncomfortable in social situations where I'm pressured to drink

Alright. Thanks guys for the PM's and the messages. I understand some think this is total bullshit, and trust me it is until it happens to you personally. But regardless, I'm gonna tell you the rest of it anyway.

After days of ignoring John (not a real name), I told him to see me at a restaurant with his wife. At 3 in the afternoon, three of use were around the table, trying to figure things out. They started talking and yes, they were married. John admitted he told his parents him and I broke up, and told Anne (the ""wife"") I was his brother. I told Anne who I really am, and she couldn't believe it either. In all honesty, Anne is beautiful and seemed like a nice girl. After almost an hour of crying and confessing, John and Anne argued. Anne walked out. John told me in time he's gonna file a divorce so we could be together. I asked him if he loves his son, and he shut up and nodded his head. I didn't say a word and just walked away as well.

11 in the evening I was drinking. I peaked at my phone and there were walls of texts from John saying sorry and wanting to get back together etc when an unknown text came up who apparently was Anne asking me if we could see each other the day after.

5 in the afternoon the following day I was at Anne's place and saw John playing with his kid. John wanted to talk to me, again, but Anne insisted we should be alone. Anne broke down and told me he loves John and how she wanted a picture perfect family for their son, but on top of that she said sorry to me like a million times. She told me should she had known John had a boyfriend, she never should have been with him in the first place. She told me even though she felt betrayed as much as I do, she still wanted to keep John.

I see now that the problem isn't with me, I thought I was supposed to be blame for being away for work most of the time. I thought it's time for John to make up his mind. I asked Anne if I could talk to John, and we did. I asked him if he loved Anne, he said not as much as he loves me. I asked him again if he loves the kid, said he does. Well, I thought the kid deserved the white-fenced picture perfect family, not to mention something I never had, so I broke up with John.

I just saw the kid needs John more than I do. John knelt and cried asking not to break up with him. Said he has a lot of plans stored for us. I told him it's obvious that he couldn't make up what he wants. And clearly, I'm not convinced I'm one of those people he wants in his life. So I just told him we could be friends. I told him I want him to make up his mind. Idealistic as it may sound, no matter how things are lost, they will always fall on their right places.

I moved to my mom's in NYC. I also filed my resignation, maybe a less demanding job would help me recover faster. My sister is currently taking over my business because I feel too shitty to do so. After emptying my condo unit, I had one real estate agent process all the papers to sell the unit. Maybe I had to get rid of that place.

I also refused to talk to John and Anne. I asked my phone company to block them from contacting me. I also removed all my virtual accounts temporarily. I know the three of us are hurt, but I know John wouldn't neglect his kid. He might not be a good lover but I know he would make a great father. For now, I'm just hitting the gym with more exercise intensity. I'm also going back to swimming laps. I'm also thinking of launching a startup company, I heard it's a great business opportunity depending on the startup.

I just need time for myself. And I just want the kid to get the undivided attention everyone deserves.

It's likely to be a long one because there is prologue, exposition, and the epilogue. It's a sort of ""Please, sit back, listen to the whole story, and, when I am finished, if you have an opinion, advice, or remark I gladly welcome it, good or bad.""


So, we've all been there. We've had our hearts stomped on &amp; crushed into powder by the indifference of other gay men. Maybe we're fortunate enough to grow and learn from the experiences, the mistakes we made and the mistakes they made. 


Christ I can't seem to stop sighing. 


I consider myself fairly, and understandably, guarded against the pitfalls of gay dating. I wouldn't say I wear my heart on my sleeve - not since my mid-20s anyway. Previous relationships had given me the experience to more successfully navigate the treacherous waters. 


It would be a challenging but not impossible journey to my heart.


So, I met R in July. We had started talking on scruff and by all appearances we wanted to hook up, but R works in the medicine and his schedule thwarted our efforts to meet up. But we continued talking and out of the blue R asked if I would be interested in going on a date instead? 


We met at his place july 12th and I was unprepared for the man that answered the door. He was beyond gorgeous; his pictures did no justice. And I'm a sucker for great smiles and his was...breathtaking. It still is. 


We went to a tapas place that was crowded, noisy, and we talked for hours. I consider myself fairly skilled in the art of conversation, and I felt confident in my ability to interact well with this man who was dazzling me with his charm, wit, intelligence, and host of other positive attributes. I was in retrospect, quite surprised that this incredible man was as interested in me. I'm not Quasimodo in the looks department or Lenny from Of Mice and Men in the brains department. But I've been shat upon and have struggled with my own issues of self-worth, and personal struggles in my life often had me questioning the point of the struggles of life and of seeking a relationship. This particular period of my life wasn't a particularly low point, but I digress.


I'm sure there are men who, if they absolutely did not want to, would not have fell under this man's spell, and even though I had voiced my qualms about returning to his domicile with him that evening to ""watch a movie"", return with him I did.


And while I did not move in, in essence, I never left. We hit it off so spectacularly. I was dazzled, and despite my efforts to remain aloof for a period, I could not find a single fault with R, and the things that would have otherwise given me pause or trepidation...it was like...those issues just melted away. It was this sort of paradigm shift for my own wants and needs. I never felt like the issues I would have had I changed to accommodate him. I was so completely taken by R that it was like, my body and mind evolved. 


And that was the best thing; R was as equally taken, if not more so. He wasn't promiscuous or a serial dater, but he seemed to evolve as well. His career made great demands on his time - I mean far in excess of the normal 40 hour week, but he accommodated me, made time for me as equally as he made time for the people in his life he'd known for years. And he did so, seemingly magically finding extra time in the day to accommodate his friends and family, and me. 


There were things R did that no man had ever really done for me or done at all point blank, that went so far to conveying the sincerity of his emotions that I felt innately that this man's affection was true and without reservation. The chief thing in my mind is R has a twin brother and R said it was not likely I would meet him, as no man he'd yet dated ever had, and there were guys he'd dated far longer than him and I ultimately wound up lasting. It came as close a sticking point I had as any to our relationship, but like the fact that he made so much of his time available to me when he had so little for himself, and the way he looked at me and how it made me feel...I felt truly, even before he said it, that this man loved me. 


And after a month, he said so, and I knew...despite how crazy it seemed to do so, I knew that I loved him as well. Even with my distaste for those who would say they loved me after knowing me for a time period that seemed inappropriately short to say such a thing, I knew. I KNEW we loved each other. Previously in my life I have, as I think have we all, to some extent, said we loved someone, and whether we meant it or not, or truly believed it or not, said it all the same because it seemed/felt right. 


I actually pushed back against his telling me he loved me, because I was so desperately afraid of loving this man because I had been so badly hurt in the past and I felt that I couldn't bear this ending. Thinking in such a way is no way to love but that's just how it was. But even the mightiest fortress around a stalwart heart will crumble with enough love and mine was no exception.


I think, apart from the love I had for my family, I would never had been party to such love. I'd read the love poems of Rumi and dreamed that one day I might love someone in that way. Sure, I'd said I'd loved guys I'd dated but - well, it's not that I lied but in retrospect I don't think I ever knew really what love truly was. Not until this, because no love ever hurt like this. 


By 3 months, we were inseparable. Even though staying over at R's added greatly to my already insanely early morning commute, I stayed over as often as he'd have me. And he as often came to my place even though it added to his equally. There were other things R did that every day contributed to my belief that this man's love was true, generous in its manifest, and pure. But even without all of that, it was the way he looked at me. I never specifically thought brown eyes would be beautiful but the weight of his gaze was...


I don't how to put it into words. I just knew. And he told me he loved every day. And when he held me, I felt safe. I felt warm. I felt at home. 


It was on Halloween that I met his brother. His sister in law was all over me. She was so excited to meet someone her brother in law was dating. The venue was loud and bodies pressed in as thick as a pea soup, but his twin brother and sister in law were charming, and they loved me from the start. 


R's friends had all loved me, conveying that they were so pleased that someone had entered R's life who was as kind and wonderful an individual as R was, and they welcomed me immediately. And now his twin brother had accepted me. R enjoyed that Halloween and that was a turning point.


R asked me a question not long before Halloween. His residency here in Boston would be finished in 2 years time and, having done his medical studies at a prominent university in new york city, he wanted to return there when he finished. Listening to him frame this question, I thought at first he was setting up the fact that we could not continue dating - as I had been party to such a breakup once before. But then R added what I never expected.


""I can't imagine you not being there with me.""


R reiterated his desire for this development a few times more over the next month and a half, and while waiting for the bus one night after dinner to celebrate our 3rd month together the conversation, through a ludicrously funny thought completely aside from the subject of marriage, alluded to it nonetheless, and R made it clear that his thoughts were leaning in that direction. But he couldn't...go there while he was still under the duress of his residency. In time...in time he said. 


It's a testament to how I felt that, despite what otherwise would have felt like things were moving insanely fast, everything felt right. And it wasn't like we were talking about moving in next week and getting married the following month. Yes, this was very far-off talk. New York and marriage two years away seemed like an insanely reasonable amount of time to wait. We had all the time in the world.


After that night my last inhibitions crumbled, what little there were left. I surrendered to this love completely. It seemed silly to create further obstacles for obstacle's sake. I believed now that, for the first time in my life, I had met someone for whom the previously terrifying prospect of commitment, of settling down and accepting one person as my mate, now seemed not only possible, but very wanted, very desired. The mental floodgates relented and I allowed myself to envision a life beyond the sort of month to month existence. In steps, of course. I wasn't naming our children or anything. But we talked about adopting a pet together. We were very much in love and all our issues didn't bother us.


And for a time, it was good.


I don't think I can pinpoint when things started to veer. R was always busy with work, but I never felt that I had to remind him to pay attention to me. Even though I didn't see him as much as my loving heart keened for, I saw him plenty for someone who was in his second year of a medical residency. So when he became even busier and was more frequently tired - this being something he had warned me of months previously - and not as up to seeing me as frequently, I didn't pay it a mind.


And when he started to seem aloof, sort of sullen, quiet, not making it out to my place anymore and instead my spending our nights together at his place near exclusively, I paid it no mind because I felt that, for someone so loving and loved, this was a small price to pay for a future together, if it was even a price at all. 


But then the aloofness became greater. The daily communication - which I'm well aware outside of a honeymoon phase cannot realistically be sustained, particularly by someone in his line of work, but, it was just...little things here and there that it was easy to ignore or explain away. I don't think I realized I was in denial yet. I was so in love. 


Sure, as all couples do, we'd had a smattering of...""passioned disagreements"" and even something that I could say approached an argument, but by his words and deeds, it still felt like we were in the honeymoon phase. But - and maybe some would disagree, but I finally realized something was up when our fourth month date rolled around and I mentioned it he seemed disconnected, and when the fifth month date arrived and we hadn't been seeing much of each other because he was working 28 hour shifts, I felt I almost had to convince him to see me to celebrate the (admittedly minor) 5th milestone when the practice had been initiated by him from the beginning. 


By this time I knew that something was up. I'd given him space, encouraged him to make time for his own friends and family, encouraging him on his time off to see them instead of me (and still seeing him when he endearingly begged that we see each other anyway) and had been open, up front, and communicative, but not overbearing. I dug deep into my sack of relationship pitfall awareness and scraped the sides. I was determined from day one to do everything in my power to see the success of this relationship and now, here in December I could no longer deny, could no longer tell myself that he was just exhausted, tired, worn out. 


Several months prior I had floated the idea of a trip to New York together on a weekend in December. A treat for us both, as we were both from New York, and it would be my primary Christmas gift to him. This was the first time I ever went away with a boyfriend. I had previously dated guys long distance, but to travel to a destination together for a vacation was something I'd never done before.


As the departure date drew nigh, there was tension, and the night before I asked him if he wanted to go on this trip. He said yes. The trip down was pleasant enough. First class on Amtrak's Acela, and a nice room in a high rise hotel in the financial district. We made love in the hotel room, and it was like how we made love when we first knew our love.


And for a brief time in New York, it was good. But it soon became clear during the time in New York that R was...not there. We went out, we saw sights, we met up with friends, ate in nice places, and unbeknownst to him, I had even toyed with the idea some time previously, of proposing to him. As the time between that first thought and the tensions arising in December, I certainly thought better of such a thought, but perhaps it bears to mention at this point that I had once been previously engaged and when that relationship ended, I swore that it would be unlikely, if ever that I would consider marriage again.


Our first real argument and I think you could pin it as the beginning of the end was on the train ride home. R's distance and aloofness during a trip I had financed (R insisted on paying for the hotel but I paid for most everything else, a trip I had painstakingly scrimped and saved for) had worn on me, and when a glass of wine spilled in my lap during the dinner service, I snapped. I didn't throw my frustrations about his own behavior whilst in new york city in his face; instead framing my unhappiness with being subject to so much bad luck and in essence the punchline to some cosmic joke. R completely misread my unhappiness and said I was throwing a tantrum to which I responded that I was in pain and that if he was going to trivialize it so blithely I didn't want to sit next to him, and I got up and sat in the old cell phone vestibule for about an hour, returning to my seat when we had about 45 minutes left in the journey.


R was silent the entire time. We disembarked at Back Bay station and Uber'ed to his home. R said we would discuss what happened when we got back to his place. In the car, I quietly took his hand and though he held it, he remained silent. 


Up the stairs, into his apartment, quietly. Undressed, teeth brushed. Silence betwixt us so thick you could part it with your hands and yet here neither dared to break the stillness interrupted only by the sounds of teeth being brushed, belts clicking and clothing falling to the floor. 


I was ready and in his bed first, and out of the corner of my eye I allowed myself to watch this man undress and move about. Even as frustrated as I was, as terrified at the silence and stillness; still, I loved him. 


I still love him.


He climbed into bed and nary a word he spoke. He had turned off the light and turned his back to me. 


I was burning. How could he just pass what transpired between us this evening unaddressed? I lay there listening to his breathing and growing ore hurt and frustrated by the second. It seemed like hours but really was only minutes, perhaps 5, maybe 10? I don't know. This had never happened and my heart was hammering. I was terrified. All relationships are tested, and I wasn't so naive to think ours never would be


***Continued in comments due to great length***","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So...I put off writing this for some time. It&amp;#39;s likely to be a long one because there is prologue, exposition, and the epilogue. It&amp;#39;s a sort of &amp;quot;Please, sit back, listen to the whole story, and, when I am finished, if you have an opinion, advice, or remark I gladly welcome it, good or bad.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we&amp;#39;ve all been there. We&amp;#39;ve had our hearts stomped on &amp;amp; crushed into powder by the indifference of other gay men. Maybe we&amp;#39;re fortunate enough to grow and learn from the experiences, the mistakes we made and the mistakes they made. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christ I can&amp;#39;t seem to stop sighing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I consider myself fairly, and understandably, guarded against the pitfalls of gay dating. I wouldn&amp;#39;t say I wear my heart on my sleeve - not since my mid-20s anyway. Previous relationships had given me the experience to more successfully navigate the treacherous waters. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be a challenging but not impossible journey to my heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I met R in July. We had started talking on scruff and by all appearances we wanted to hook up, but R works in the medicine and his schedule thwarted our efforts to meet up. But we continued talking and out of the blue R asked if I would be interested in going on a date instead? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We met at his place july 12th and I was unprepared for the man that answered the door. He was beyond gorgeous; his pictures did no justice. And I&amp;#39;m a sucker for great smiles and his was...breathtaking. It still is. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went to a tapas place that was crowded, noisy, and we talked for hours. I consider myself fairly skilled in the art of conversation, and I felt confident in my ability to interact well with this man who was dazzling me with his charm, wit, intelligence, and host of other positive attributes. I was in retrospect, quite surprised that this incredible man was as interested in me. I&amp;#39;m not Quasimodo in the looks department or Lenny from Of Mice and Men in the brains department. But I&amp;#39;ve been shat upon and have struggled with my own issues of self-worth, and personal struggles in my life often had me questioning the point of the struggles of life and of seeking a relationship. This particular period of my life wasn&amp;#39;t a particularly low point, but I digress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure there are men who, if they absolutely did not want to, would not have fell under this man&amp;#39;s spell, and even though I had voiced my qualms about returning to his domicile with him that evening to &amp;quot;watch a movie&amp;quot;, return with him I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while I did not move in, in essence, I never left. We hit it off so spectacularly. I was dazzled, and despite my efforts to remain aloof for a period, I could not find a single fault with R, and the things that would have otherwise given me pause or trepidation...it was like...those issues just melted away. It was this sort of paradigm shift for my own wants and needs. I never felt like the issues I would have had I changed to accommodate him. I was so completely taken by R that it was like, my body and mind evolved. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that was the best thing; R was as equally taken, if not more so. He wasn&amp;#39;t promiscuous or a serial dater, but he seemed to evolve as well. His career made great demands on his time - I mean far in excess of the normal 40 hour week, but he accommodated me, made time for me as equally as he made time for the people in his life he&amp;#39;d known for years. And he did so, seemingly magically finding extra time in the day to accommodate his friends and family, and me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were things R did that no man had ever really done for me or done at all point blank, that went so far to conveying the sincerity of his emotions that I felt innately that this man&amp;#39;s affection was true and without reservation. The chief thing in my mind is R has a twin brother and R said it was not likely I would meet him, as no man he&amp;#39;d yet dated ever had, and there were guys he&amp;#39;d dated far longer than him and I ultimately wound up lasting. It came as close a sticking point I had as any to our relationship, but like the fact that he made so much of his time available to me when he had so little for himself, and the way he looked at me and how it made me feel...I felt truly, even before he said it, that this man loved me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And after a month, he said so, and I knew...despite how crazy it seemed to do so, I knew that I loved him as well. Even with my distaste for those who would say they loved me after knowing me for a time period that seemed inappropriately short to say such a thing, I knew. I KNEW we loved each other. Previously in my life I have, as I think have we all, to some extent, said we loved someone, and whether we meant it or not, or truly believed it or not, said it all the same because it seemed/felt right. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually pushed back against his telling me he loved me, because I was so desperately afraid of loving this man because I had been so badly hurt in the past and I felt that I couldn&amp;#39;t bear this ending. Thinking in such a way is no way to love but that&amp;#39;s just how it was. But even the mightiest fortress around a stalwart heart will crumble with enough love and mine was no exception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think, apart from the love I had for my family, I would never had been party to such love. I&amp;#39;d read the love poems of Rumi and dreamed that one day I might love someone in that way. Sure, I&amp;#39;d said I&amp;#39;d loved guys I&amp;#39;d dated but - well, it&amp;#39;s not that I lied but in retrospect I don&amp;#39;t think I ever knew really what love truly was. Not until this, because no love ever hurt like this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 3 months, we were inseparable. Even though staying over at R&amp;#39;s added greatly to my already insanely early morning commute, I stayed over as often as he&amp;#39;d have me. And he as often came to my place even though it added to his equally. There were other things R did that every day contributed to my belief that this man&amp;#39;s love was true, generous in its manifest, and pure. But even without all of that, it was the way he looked at me. I never specifically thought brown eyes would be beautiful but the weight of his gaze was...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t how to put it into words. I just knew. And he told me he loved every day. And when he held me, I felt safe. I felt warm. I felt at home. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was on Halloween that I met his brother. His sister in law was all over me. She was so excited to meet someone her brother in law was dating. The venue was loud and bodies pressed in as thick as a pea soup, but his twin brother and sister in law were charming, and they loved me from the start. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;R&amp;#39;s friends had all loved me, conveying that they were so pleased that someone had entered R&amp;#39;s life who was as kind and wonderful an individual as R was, and they welcomed me immediately. And now his twin brother had accepted me. R enjoyed that Halloween and that was a turning point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;R asked me a question not long before Halloween. His residency here in Boston would be finished in 2 years time and, having done his medical studies at a prominent university in new york city, he wanted to return there when he finished. Listening to him frame this question, I thought at first he was setting up the fact that we could not continue dating - as I had been party to such a breakup once before. But then R added what I never expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t imagine you not being there with me.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;R reiterated his desire for this development a few times more over the next month and a half, and while waiting for the bus one night after dinner to celebrate our 3rd month together the conversation, through a ludicrously funny thought completely aside from the subject of marriage, alluded to it nonetheless, and R made it clear that his thoughts were leaning in that direction. But he couldn&amp;#39;t...go there while he was still under the duress of his residency. In time...in time he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a testament to how I felt that, despite what otherwise would have felt like things were moving insanely fast, everything felt right. And it wasn&amp;#39;t like we were talking about moving in next week and getting married the following month. Yes, this was very far-off talk.

I'll dive straight into the problem I am having. I have been with a guy for two years now. We've been friends for four years, but for the first two that I knew him, he identified as straight and nothing ever happened. I really liked him and after two years, he admitted he liked me too, and we got together. We spent a year hooking up in hotels and then after a year we took the plunge and moved in together.

Unfortunately, our relationship is a secret to everybody who knows him. My family and friends know all about us, but his family think he lives alone in a strange city, unknown to them is that I live here too. This gets me down because it causes me to feel some kind of shame towards our relationship, I have explained to him that I look forward to the day that his family know and we can be a proper couple. However they are quite working class/homophobic and he tells me that they are the kind of people who make throwaway comments about gays that are offensive and insensitive, so I understand he has reservations about saying anything to them. He does have an amazing relationship with his family, and I have met them once and they were nice, but I understand why he is scared.

However that is not even my main issue. I am conflicted because I feel the relationship is drawing to a close. I don't feel the same way about him that I used to. When we met I was infatuated, but being together has made me even slightly resentful of him. He is very opinionated and the things he says sometimes make me feel like a disgusting human being. We have sex, but if gay sex is ever mentioned on TV, or if there is a gay themed TV show or anything like that, he's quick to comment it's disgusting. I know he doesn't *really* mean it because he fucks me and loves it, so I don't really get why he does it or where he's coming from. He is very disapproving of 'gay culture' but I'm very proud of being gay, and I would love to have gay friends, but I know he wouldn't be very happy if I did. He wouldn't trust them or me because in his opinion, all gays just want to fuck each other. And maybe he's right but so what? Maybe that's something I identify with, how is that my fault?

He is the first guy I have been with, and since being with him, I feel I have become a very sexual person. I don't have a lot of sex with him because I have lost a lot of my attraction to him. But deep down still, I think about sex a lot. I try to suppress it for him but deep down I feel like I have a really sleazy side. Part of me wants to just go out and hookup with guys, I'm not in the best shape since being with him (I've put on a bit of a pot belly) but I feel like I want to just leave him, focus on my job and go to the gym, get more attractive and fuck a load of guys. I've always really liked black guys, but he has openly said if I ever fucked a black guy, he would kill me. I don't know why he is s racist, I think it stems from growing up in central London and not having overall positive experiences with black people there... But I personally fantasize about just fucking about with some black guy with a big dick and he makes me feel disgusting for having fantasies and things like that. I tried to discuss open relationships with him once and he was very angry and quick to comment how it's a typical gay thing to want an open relationship. He thinks the stereotypical gay image is one of AIDS and sex and sluttiness, and I appreciate that there is a lot of that in the gay community, but to paint them all with the same brush offends me.

I suggested having a threesome, and he again made me feel like an awful human being. He seemed to suggest that only sluts and typical gays have threesomes, and I tried to explain how having a threesome wouldn't make me like him any less, sex is just something fun to do so why not make it even better. He didn't take it well and shut the idea down. I'm definitely a lot more open minded than he is and I would love to explore my sexuality and life in general. I'm very much of the opinion that you only get one life, so why would I want to spend the next 60 years of my life just fucking this one same person? How could I not possibly get bored? I'm only in my early 20s and the thought of spending the rest of my entire life with him just seems... boring.

This post is really incoherent and is really just a stream of rambling thoughts but it's reached a point where I feel I need to leave and do what I want to do with life. I love him as a friend, even if he is a dick. But the problem with leaving is that we live together, I'm 100 miles away from ANY friends or family whatsoever, I have a job here but I couldn't afford to live alone. My job contract ends in May so I don't know if I should keep pretending until then and stay with him until I have to leave, or if I should bit the bullet and move home. 

I feel awful because as bad as I paint him to be, he loves me immensely. I find it almost smothering, he gets anxious if he's away and we don't speak for a while, whereas I can go days without speaking and really not care. I feel bad because it took a lot for him to come out to himself and open up to me and create this relationship, considering that before we met he'd never even kissed a guy (he was quite a womaniser) and I feel obliged to stick it out and try and make us both happy, but at the same time I know that if I'm not satisfied, it's not fair to stay and pretend. 

A couple of months ago some friends took me to a gay bar, and I got talking to some guy, I was a dick and spent the night kissing this guy and even tried to convince him to get a hotel with me, but luckily he said no. But doing that reinforced to me that I don't want to be in a relationship, even thought I was a virgin until I was 21 and it got me depressed never meeting anybody, I feel I have the confidence now to try hookups, or go on dates... I'm scared if I leave him, I'll end up alone and miss him and want to get back together. I've never been in a relationship before and never experienced a breakup before. I feel horrible for having these thoughts. But what if I do cheat? I know it'd be my fault, but part of me doesn't care and I feel horrible for thinking like that.
