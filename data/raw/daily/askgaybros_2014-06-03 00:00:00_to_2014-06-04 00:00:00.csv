I'm 17 and this is all pretty new to me.  
  
I've been with my boyfriend for like 3-4 months sexually, and he's a pure 100% bottom. He never wants to top, which is great for me because I'm a 100% top. I lost my virginity to him and I haven't been with anyone else.    
  
The thing is, he never wants his cock touched during sex. I mean, touched, sure, but not like jerked or anything. It gets really, REALLY hard, but he normally keeps it in a jock or in shorts or even in underwear while I fuck him, the tighter the better, and I know he isn't cumming, but he says he's getting off anyway.  
  
""I don't *cum* cum, I just cum in my head,"" he said to me once. ""I don't like squirting cumming, I'm a *bottom*.""  
  
I've never heard this before, and I don't know if it's normal, or if I'm just a bad top and he's not getting off and trying to make me feel better, or what.  
  
I know he has a bunch of toys, and I know he really, really, *really* enjoys his prostate, and I've had a plug in and know the prostate is powerful, but I just don't understand how he could be getting off without *actually* getting off.  
  
Is he just not cumming? Is that healthy? Shouldn't he be super frustrated all the time? Do bottoms *like* to be frustrated?  
  
He will pull me on top of him, grind me for a while, sure, but mostly he just flips onto his stomach and asks to be fucked that way,   
  
But mainly I just want to know if this is normal. If we bring other guys in who are bottoms or if we move on one day, are all (most) bottoms like this? He's older, if it matters, 20, and has had partners before me. That's why I'm worried that he's just making me feel better.  
  
I've talked to him about it, and he just laughs it off (he's super positive and always really sweet to me about it, but it's hard to know exactly what's going on with him sometimes).  
  
I just want to be a good top, guys. I'm not in this for the hole, I'm in this for the beautiful, sexy dude, and I want to be able to please him...     
  
Again, I'm sorry if this is stupid, I just know what I know from porn and reddit and stuff.

The first time I took PEP was when a guy teased my ass with his uncovered penis.

So I'm wondering - how do you bros hook up with guys without freaking out and going on PEP each time? Am I just unlucky, or is it common to be essentially raped bareback during sex where it was agreed beforehand to be safe?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just had anal sex for the first time Saturday night.

But he being straight meant that it was impossible for anything to happen between us, even though I sort of sought to feel him out on several occasions to see if there might be some sort of chance between us.

I’ve moved on and been sort of slowly working out this relationship with another gaybro. 

But then, just a few days ago, my friend drops a gigantic bombshell on me, saying that he thinks that he’s bi. Suddenly all of these emotions that I’ve been working to repress come out like a flood. I was really confused at first and then sort of played his coming out off and I hurried out of there; I panicked, badly. He’s been trying to contact me, probably because I sort of left him in the lurch, and I’ve been avoiding him like crazy, even though I should talk to him (yes, I’m an ass for that).

The experience in itself was HORRIBLE first off I met the guy I was to hook up with on craigslist, thought why the hell not and went for it. Met up with him mind you he was older ... a lot older but not too old (heard older guys take care of newbies) and I should have known from the get go that it wasn't going to work but I said screw it and gave it a shot anyway.


So here I am with this guy I don't even know and he offers to take us to some trashy spa place (can't remember the name). The only reason we went there was because they had ""private rooms"". So we go and he asked me to drive and I said ""why the hell not."" I should have known when I got there I wasn't as interested as I thought I was there were naked guys walking everywhere and i'm cringing up and freaking out (internally). I know some of you are probably thinking by this point why didn't you just say ""no"" and go home; well I had a few drinks to ""loosen up"" so I wasn't really in a state where I cared about much. (NEVER DRINK AND DRIVE BAD MISTAKE NOT DOING THIS SHIT AGAIN, I'm lucky I wasn't pulled over and apprehended.)


So we get in the room and he puts on some porn and takes off his pants and starts to jerk it and ask me to jerk him off. I did ... it wasn't too bad I mean I started getting hard, then he asked me to blow him and this is where it started going downhill. So I start blowing him I could only do it for maybe a a few minutes before I knew this was definitely not for me (thank gawd for lube and the fact he kept his eyes shut or he would have realized I stopped blowing him five-ten minutes into our little escapade). 


I started getting soft fast and then he ask me to finger him, I did thinking maybe it would bring back my hard on ... just used one finger. Eventually he's asking me to put my dick in him, bad thing was I was completely flaccid and there was no way I was gonna get my dick in him. So I compromised and considering he was keeping his eyes closed I just added another finger, he starts asking ""is your dick in me?"" I lie and say yes, start pushing my fingers in further and he feels them and mistakes them for my dick; I keep my fingers in him for a sec while he jerks and tries to get off. Alcohol starts setting in (thank gawd) and I have to pee so I say ""keep yourself busy while I go to the restroom"". Threw my pants back on and ran out of the room ... 


Now I guess its normal at these spas to walk around naked but I still had all my clothes on (was not comfortable at all) ... so I hit up the restroom and go for a stall; I try to close the door only to find some random guy had followed me into the bathroom and he's asking if i'll leave it open. He drops his towel and reveals he's hard as a rock he then says, ""you still have your clothes on? Why don't you finish up in there and let me help you out of those and onto this. (referring to his dick)""


Mind you the guy wasn't bad looking at all he actually had a nice body but ... NO! This is when I start to sober up and say ""no"" ... so I close the stall door and he says ""that's fine you like a little privacy while you do your business; I can wait out here."" This is the most awkward pissing situation I have ever been in besides peeing with a boner. So I take my time and he says ""you okay in there? you're not gonna make me wait much longer are you?"" I flush the toilet and open the stall door only for him to barge in and invade my space. (Freak out more)


He tries to get me to touch his dick and he's trying to kiss me, all of which did not happen. He then says ""don't pretend like you don't want this, your friend has nothing on me."" I just say ""okay then"" and try and walk around him, next thing you know i'm backed into a wall with him trying to grab my ass. He said some nasty shit in my ear and starts to kiss my neck and don't hate me for this bros but I squeezed his member, he groans and sits on the toilet and starts cussing at me. I tell him he should have pissed off when he knew I wasn't interested. and I leave and head back to the room.


Mr. Craigslist is still jerking off and I lie and say I have to pick up a friend for work. He says okay gimme a minute to finish up and he asks me to take off my pants and join him on the bed again. I leave my pants on and sit on the bed and he tries to finish up. 


I gave him 5 minutes (trying to be courteous) and I said okay I really need to go, get dressed. He does and he's looking at me to see if I had a good time (obviously not) we leave the room i'm looking around for Mr. Bathroom Stall prepared to throw down if he steps up ... I see him over by the pool area, I run up to the front desk which is literally a few steps away from the pool area; I ask for my things back and the damn front desk attendant is some kind of coke fiend!!! Yes I know trashy and more red flags that this entire situation was a massive hell no.


So Mr. Coke Fiend is trying to find our lockers and some guy jabs a finger at my butt to get my attention. ""If you're ever back again and i'm here maybe we can meet up?"" (something along those lines) He winks and walks away (cocky son of a bitch). Mr. Craigslist asks if I know him and I said no I really need to get the hell out of here. Coke Fiend FINALLY gives me my stuff and I run out of there leaving Mr. Craigslist behind ... i'm headed near my car when Craigslist finally comes out. 


When he gets in he asks if everything is okay, I lie and say yeah ... he starts talking about future meet ups (~~haha no~~) and I'm just nodding my head humming in agreement with him. He asks if I want something to eat I say ""no I have to get home and go grab a friend,"" he starts saying he understands and says we'll grab food before we fool around next time we meet up (~~lol no~~). I finally get back to his place and let him out he says until next time and I speed off, head to Starbucks and shoot him a text saying i'm not interested and the experience in a whole was terrible but interesting.


Now after that mess I am facing a dilemma ... it seems as though I may not be as attracted to guys as I thought ... should I try again with a different guy? Has this ever happened to any of you, where you questioned whether or not the attraction you thought you felt was actually false? Should I try again with someone else? Please let me know my mind is a mess ... and sorry for the wall of text and grammatical errors.

**Moral of the story**: Met up with a guy to test the waters and the experience was bad and now i'm questioning my attraction to men and I am wondering if I should try with someone else ...

I need someone to tell me if I just need to move the fuck on, or if there is a chance that there might be something to this. 

A few years ago, I drunkenly told my best friend in the midst of an argument, after a night out,  that I had stronger feelings for him than I previously had thought. The argument ended there, and he went out from 3am to 5am - supposedly 'thinking'. However, when I tried to broach the subject the next day, he wouldnt even turn to look at me, he just stared at his computer, and said nothing. The issue ultimately lay unresolved. 

Things moved on, and we enjoyed a very unusual friendship, which was intimate and passionate. We would regularly argue - and I mean shout and hit - about stupid things. I know he would play games with me, and pretend he was angry or cold, just to see how I would react. 

Although he said he had a girlfriend before we met, he never got with any girls whilst we were at University, which is strange as he has told all of us that he was somewhat of a player before he came, sleeping with ten girls. I believe this to be a lie, and since I have known him, he has lied about getting with other random girls. 

Perhaps the biggest question mark began when I started seeing someone else. He had jokingly gone through my phone to send a joke text, without my knowledge, when he happened upon a text that said 'how did the date go?'. There was no date, this was a joke from my other friend about a work night out, but from this text he essentially tried to 'cut me out of his life' (his words). Coincidentally, the next week after he started doing this, I started seeing someone (who is unimportant) which must have only fuelled whatever rage he was feeling at me. We ultimately managed to resolve this months later, but it strikes me as odd that he would be so ready to cut his best friend out of his life over just a text, with no kind of questioning before. He never asked me, he just did it. 

Since we have left University, we have been texting pretty much everyday, or near to that, often all day, sending about 50 texts a day. He initiates a lot of this. I know he doesnt text ANYONE else in this manner, or this frequently, as he is kind of a loner in that sense. 

We also went on a spur of the moment (literally hours) road trip holiday to Germany. It was a very intimate trip, just the two of us, which again strikes me as odd. One, he isn't one to do that kind of thing usually. And two, I've told him I liked him before. Fine, ok we got over it (although without resolution), but jsut part of me feels that if I knew someone had liked me, and could potentially do again (he must kind of have a suspicion, seeing as I never argue with or react to people like I do to him), would you take them on holiday, just the two of you, in such a romantic set up? I don't know? I mean yes we're best friends, but he has other 'best friends' who he has known for longer, who he hasn't done that for.
 
I just don't know what to make of all this. I feel like it points to him at least questioning what he feels for me, but its been years now, and even if he did, I can't hang around waiting for him to admit something which he may or may not admit. It feels as if I have been in a sexless relationship for the last 3 years, but may just lead to him never have been feeling what I want him to... and Im just holding myself back from meeting other people who may like me the way I like himI just dont get his behaviour. Its bizarre. 

Can anyone help?
