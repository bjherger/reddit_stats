This is very embarrassing, so please don't hate me.

I am in a relationship with my boyfriend for nearly two years now and we have our ups and downs as well just like any normal couple. We do, however, stopped having sex for nearly a year now. It's not what you think. I had a surgery last year for an anal fissure surgery where they had to cut the sphincter muscle to loosen it up to allow the fissure to heal quickly as I was having too much pain. And no, it's not from anal sex at all. It happened after I lost too much weight in a short period of time (95lbs in 3 months!)

So we stopped having sex, because I am extremely paranoid that if he enters me again, it'll rupture the whole thing or that my fissure will come back. We did try having sex where we used a lot of lube, but I can still feel the pain. He never believed me but he never forced me either. Just the occasional guilt-trip.

Not that this matters, but I'm 25 and he's 30. He is my first ever relationship and I was probably his 10th or whatever. When I was with him, he just got out of a 7 year relationship the same year we started dating. I know.

I probably should also mention that he is still living with his ex. Yup. Oh, and I live here too! Awkward. But we never talked. Not once.

But bros, that's not even the problem. Gosh I wish I could already tell what the problem is by now. You can really tell from the title how confused I am...

My work requires me to travel out of country a lot, and he knows that I love traveling. When I travel, I feel lonely and would resort to apps like Tinder or Scruff. Not to get laid, because obviously I'm still paranoid about having sex. Just meet up and drinks, and possibly some sexy time that does not involve penetration. Again, I know. &lt;EDIT: I can't stress this enough, saying ""I know"" means I know it doesn't matter if there's penetration or not, it's still SEX. I get it. That's why I said ""I KNOW"". GEEZ

He knows that I like doing that too, because every time I have to travel for work, he would give me a pack of condoms. He's guilt-tripping me, but I can never use them anyway considering I'm still not ready.

So the problem is (finally!), I love this man so much, but not IN love with him. The surgery really changed everything and I hate myself for that. This man will definitely be my friend for life, but I'm not sure he knows how I feel about him. We still treat each other like a couple, and I know he really loves me but I just can't find it in my heart to tell him how I really feel. I mean, I just wanna have fun, not be in a relationship and stuff like that but I'd still like to come home to him at the end of the day. But not in a romantic way.

I'm a horrible person, but I just don't know what else I should do...


TL;DR: I'm in a two year relationship with a man I'm not in love with, and need some advise.


EDIT: If anyone wanted update, I finally told him what I really wanted. He threatened to kill my dog, including two of his own. I am out of here.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys, I&amp;#39;ve been on r/gaybros for years now and finally decided to have a throwaway for this.

Both of those haunted me so badly throughout my high school years that I missed 100+ days of school my sophomore year, due to being too sad to get myself out of bed in the morning. I was an emotional wreck - suicidal, lonely, depressed, and hopeless. I got told so many times by my teachers that I would never amount to anything, and that only made matters worse - on the days where I wasn't too sad to go to school, I was too nervous for fear of judgment by those who are supposed to support me. 

The depression? That started the year before, when I really began to explore and struggle with my sexuality. I hooked up with guys off of apps like Grindr left and right, sometimes 3 a day. I knew I was gay, but was so scared to admit it, even to myself. Being promiscuous was my way of getting attention, feeling like someone out there cared about me, even if it was only because I was an easy fuck - not because I needed to explore my sexuality. 

Fast forward a couple years. Now almost 18 years old, we move back to my hometown in Arizona. I meet a guy, fall in love, and eventually marry that same guy at age 20. We were together for 3 years when I finally grew a pair and ended the relationship, something I had been desperate to do for at least a year, but was too scared to do.
My ex (let's call him Jay) was one of those textbook mental abusers. Not only would he lash out at me in fits of pure anger, he would always make it my fault that he was angry. Sometimes I thought it was my fault - ""maybe I shouldn't have denied him sex, then he wouldn't have gotten so mad at me"" kinda thing. He kept me from my friends and family, isolated me from everything that made me myself. ..then slowly chipped away at my confidence to the point that I couldn't even trust my own judgment anymore - he convinced me I was stupid and he knew best for everything. 
Like I said, I finally made my way out of that relationship earlier this year. I'm currently seeing a new guy, this is someone I know and trust so it's actually been good for me thus far. For once, my boyfriend asks how my day went, rather than yelling at me for doing some random thing wrong. This relationship is good for me, I've come a long way, and I feel like my dating life is going in the right direction. I'm pretty sure my boyfriend is the only thing keeping me from being a complete failure at this point. (No, I don't ""need him"" to live or anything,  but he is an incredible support system for me right now.) 
The problem I'm having now is, how to keep the mental damage from my past relationship from destroying the progress I've made. I'm currently in a program of study that I've dreamed of being a part of for years. It's a tremendous opportunity for me, but because I still feel like a worthless piece of shit deep down, I've begun the process of fucking myself over academically. I took a whole phase of classes off for some personal time last month, and while I can fill in the gaps later, if I deviate from the program schedule any more, I will lose my spot. I'm only one day away from losing my spot in my dream program, because I feel even worse than I did before, back in high school. I'm studying to be an aircraft mechanic (and eventually an engineer), and my ex actually emasculated me so badly that I think I'm too much of a pussy to work on airplanes or use tools correctly, even though I know deep down I'm good with my hands and am more than competent. 
I know I would feel better about myself and be able to pick up/move on had my confidence and self esteem been crushed so badly in the past 3 years. Has anyone else been through something like this successfully? How did you convince yourself that your life is worth living again so you can chase your own dreams and start anew? 

I know I have the ""you had the chance to leave earlier, it's your fault you're in this situation"" comments coming, and please, do voice your opinions. But what I'm looking for here is not ""why am I at this point in my life?"", I just need a little guidance to pick myself up and move on before I cause myself too much more damage.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;First off, let me say I&amp;#39;ve always suffered from anxiety or depression in one form or another.

I have a weird dick.
            
No, not a microdick, or a two-headed one (The internet, man). I have  [Phimosis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phimosis) (Wikipedia page, nsfw, but safe for life). It's not so bad that my foreskin is immovable, but I definitely can't pull it all the way back without some serious pain.

To provide a little exposition, I'm a late bloomer (Early 20s, have never been in a gay relationship let alone anything sexual). But I've recently met a guy who I am falling head over heels for, we've been on two dates now with a third on the way and I get the distinct feeling things are going to get intimate pretty soon (Knock on wood. Heh, wood).

So how do I tell him? Will I just take off my pants and hope he doesn't recoil in fear? This coupled with my sexual inexperience is giving me a wicked case of anxiety. If anyone has dealt with anything even remotely similar to this, I could really use your advice.

Oh and regarding the actual phimosis, there are treatment options. I definitely want to avoid circumcision for obvious reasons. But treatment options could take months to a year to correct. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Askgaybros,&lt;/p&gt;

I am living a double life, and I have been for a few years now. On one side, all of my buddies and my family see me as a regular college bro (recently graduated). I was a varsity athlete in college, a bit of a jock, smart guy, bright future, blah blah. I would imagine I seem extremely straight from an outsiders point of view…deep voice, obsessed with sports and video games, love spending time just hanging with my bros. 

There is another side of my life however, I have been secretly dating another dude for the last 2.5 years. We meet online, he was in grad school while I was an undergrad when we met. He is 32, I'm 23, so there is a 9 year age difference, but we have pretty much gotten over that. He is a lot like me, athletic guy, ""straight""-acting, smart guy…and he is already crazy successful. Oh yeah, and neither of us is out to anyone, we have kept our relationship a complete secret from literally everyone. 

We have both gotten crazy good and making up lies to friends and family, and we have even been living together for the last year. We both realize that this double life we are both living is not going to last, and that we are going to have to merge our lives into one if we plan on staying together, which we both want to do. 

I guess I am just looking for advice, thoughts, or comments in general. I have never talked to anyone but my boyfriend about this…

Edit: After thinking about it, here are the questions I am really looking to ask, but general comments and thoughts still welcome.

What is the best way to go about coming out when in a relationship completely in the closet? Is it a bad idea for one of us to come out before the other, could that cause tension and/or put too much pressure on the other person to come out before he is ready? When we do finally get around to telling our friends/families, is it best to tell them everything at once (i've been dating a guy for the last 2.5 years and living with him behind everyones back for the last year), or come out in steps (i like dudes -&gt; i'm dating someone -&gt; we have been together for …)?

Full disclosure, she’s an ex-girlfriend from an eon ago when I was trying to be straight. We’re not terribly close now, but I was at her wedding, and she’s stayed with us once or twice in the 5+ years I've been out of school. Frankly, our friendship has been fading, and it’s not really something I’m all that upset about. She’s known for…well, being a bitchy drama queen.

In any case, she divulged that she was in the early stages of separating from her husband, and that she expected to begin the process of divorce in relatively short order. (Not that it matters, but they've only been married for about 18 months). We did the usual “oh, we’re so sorry to hear about that” sort of thing and offered our help/advice where needed. 

Here’s where it gets weird. Although she was very chill about the divorce in the presence of both me and my partner, when she was alone with me, it was clear that she did need help…but a very particular kind of help. That is to say, she really wants my dick. 

For example, I was drinking a beer (just one) while my partner was upstairs getting a shower, and she said, “Be careful, don’t get too drunk that you’ll have sex with me.” Followed by a wink. Later, she asked for a tour of the basement (we just moved into a new house), and she cornered me and just did an info dump on how bad her husband is in bed, and how much better I am compared to him. (Not in any way bragging here, just repeating what she said). She kept dropping little hints about babies and pregnancies and…well, it was overwhelmingly obvious that she was trying to make something happen between the two of us. 

The first night she stayed with us, my partner made it known that he too had picked up on her hints (those directed at me), and that he would be more comfortable if she left a day earlier than planned. So the following morning, we made up a fake errand/emergency, and politely got her out of the house and on her way home. 

So here we are a few weeks later, and she already wants to know when she can come back and visit us. 

I guess the help I’m asking could be summed up like this: For a billion reasons, it’s obvious that I in no way, shape, or form will/want to have sex with her. She’s making my partner and me uncomfortable with her advances, and I’m worried she’ll try to force the issue. I appreciate that she’s in a difficult situation with her divorce, but I’m not interested in being swept up in her tornado. 

I no longer hold a lot of value in our friendship, but she is one of my oldest friends, and surely that counts for something. I don’t want to be unjustly cruel either…particularly given her fragile state at the moment. 

What might be the best way to proceed?

&lt;p&gt;I guess the help I’m asking could be summed up like this: For a billion reasons, it’s obvious that I in no way, shape, or form will/want to have sex with her. She’s making my partner and me uncomfortable with her advances, and I’m worried she’ll try to force the issue. I appreciate that she’s in a difficult situation with her divorce, but I’m not interested in being swept up in her tornado. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I no longer hold a lot of value in our friendship, but she is one of my oldest friends, and surely that counts for something. I don’t want to be unjustly cruel either…particularly given her fragile state at the moment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What might be the best way to proceed? &lt;/p&gt;

Poz bros, can anyone tell me if Ryan White coverage is a nation wide thing once you have it? 

My bf is poz and we are moving to western Oklahoma. That presents all kinds of challenges as a serodiscordant gay couple, but the one we are most worried about is continued coverage for his Complera through the RWA. It's about $3000/month, and thankfully we pay nothing right now between insurance and RWA. We can't afford for that to change. 

Has anyone moved to another state while receiving Ryan White? Did you need to change anything or did coverage continue?

Also, anyone know of a good HIV doc in OKC or surrounding areas? The doc he has now oversees several others and their primary focus is HIV/AIDS. I'm not real comfortable with a regular family physician who's never dealt with HIV taking over. 

Answers or links would be great, thanks!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Idk if this is the best place to ask this, hook me up with the right sub if not please. &lt;/p&gt;
