We've been together about 6 months.  First two months, we couldn't get enough of each other.  Staying up til 4am rolling around in bed, no care in the world what the next day held for us with no sleep.  The two months after that, it was pretty much just obligatory oral / mutual JO about 3-4 nights a week, with the occasional sex.  The past two months, we hook up right before bed, tired, about weekly, and we haven't had sex for three weeks.

It is absolutely killing me.  I could hook up every night, sometimes multiple times a night.  He seems to NEVER want to anymore.  It makes me feel unloved and unwanted.  He makes me feel like ""the bad guy"" for making the first move or suggesting we do anything intimate.

What can I do??  Our relationship is based on so much more than just sexual relations, but without the sex aspect, I feel like we are becoming just friends again.  I feel hopeless.

I'm ready to start dating but I'm a little worried. What I haven't really explained to the therapist, because he is more of just an anxiety and gay issues therapist rather than a sex therapist, is that I have a lot of weird little sexual kinks. 

It's nothing too crazy but not exactly tame like a foot fetish either.  It's a BDSM fetish where I'm extremely submissive. I've fantasized about hypnosis, pup play, and diaper play for years. I think I was so reluctant to be gay that I developed these fetishes when I was 13 and 14. Instead of looking at men online I stumbled on some erotic stories involving those subjects and these fetishes have only grown stronger over the years. 

I used to be worried that this was the only way I could ever get off and I'd have a hard time finding someone who was into it. But over the last few years, growing more confident in my sexuality, I've been able to get off to porn that didn't involve those kinks. Usually someone is still really submissive but they aren't necessarily barking like a dog. I also was able to fool around with a friend in a hot tub, and while I let him take control, I wasn't also caught up fantasizing about him trying to humiliate me with diapers. I was just in the moment and just enjoyed being with him, his hands, his dick. After that night, I didn't get off to any of my fetishes for weeks and solely looked at pretty vanilla porn online. So I've come to pinpoint that it isn't these specific fetishes that get me off, it's being submissive to man that really gets me off. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is...I know those fetishes won't ever go away not completely. But I think at the end of the day it isn't about pup play, diaper play, or hypnosis for me...it's about being submissive to a guy. So I have a bit of a dilemma. I have an opportunity to sleep with a guy whose into those kinks...all three.  This would be the first time I ever slept with someone. It turns me on but I have this bad gut feeling about it. I don't know him that well and I'm kind of getting the creeps a bit. I feel like if I'm never going to have a healthy relationship if my first time sleeping with a man involves pup play. I think I would always associate sex with a fetish, and I don't want that. I want someone to show me the ropes and let it just be about us. I can and still want to be submissive but it doesn't have to be super kinky. At the same time, I feel like I'm wasting an opportunity. I'm 27, I guess I'm just ready to sleep with someone, and this is a great opportunity...but maybe I should cool my jets and wait just a little bit longer for someone to come along. I'm just not sure what to do. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;m 27 years old and I just came out to my family and friends after seeing a therapist for a little while. I&amp;#39;m ready to start dating but I&amp;#39;m a little worried. What I haven&amp;#39;t really explained to the therapist, because he is more of just an anxiety and gay issues therapist rather than a sex therapist, is that I have a lot of weird little sexual kinks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s nothing too crazy but not exactly tame like a foot fetish either.  It&amp;#39;s a BDSM fetish where I&amp;#39;m extremely submissive. I&amp;#39;ve fantasized about hypnosis, pup play, and diaper play for years. I think I was so reluctant to be gay that I developed these fetishes when I was 13 and 14. Instead of looking at men online I stumbled on some erotic stories involving those subjects and these fetishes have only grown stronger over the years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to be worried that this was the only way I could ever get off and I&amp;#39;d have a hard time finding someone who was into it. But over the last few years, growing more confident in my sexuality, I&amp;#39;ve been able to get off to porn that didn&amp;#39;t involve those kinks. Usually someone is still really submissive but they aren&amp;#39;t necessarily barking like a dog. I also was able to fool around with a friend in a hot tub, and while I let him take control, I wasn&amp;#39;t also caught up fantasizing about him trying to humiliate me with diapers. I was just in the moment and just enjoyed being with him, his hands, his dick. After that night, I didn&amp;#39;t get off to any of my fetishes for weeks and solely looked at pretty vanilla porn online. So I&amp;#39;ve come to pinpoint that it isn&amp;#39;t these specific fetishes that get me off, it&amp;#39;s being submissive to man that really gets me off. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess what I&amp;#39;m trying to say is...I know those fetishes won&amp;#39;t ever go away not completely. But I think at the end of the day it isn&amp;#39;t about pup play, diaper play, or hypnosis for me...it&amp;#39;s about being submissive to a guy. So I have a bit of a dilemma.

I'm sorry that in the crazily superficial gay world you are not considered physically attractive.

But I'm not sorry that I am. I work very hard to look like I do: gym time, skin care, diet, and grooming all take time and commitment. So when the guy that you like at the club comes up and buys me a drink, I didn't steal him from you. So stop telling people that that's how it went down. When I'm in a relationship and I talk to another cute guy, I'm not flirting, I'm not cheating on my boyfriend, so please just stop. When I'm not in a relationship and I'm talking to a cute guy who is in one, I'm not flirting, I'm not trying to break a couple up, so please just stop.

Long story short, met a nice guy via grindr, we started texting and it's just good conversation (nothing to indicate he wants a hookup cause he aspires to have a relationship and eventually marriage), a week goes by, we meet up then we go out the following couple of nights because we really like each other.  No sex happened and we both agreed to wait just a bit longer cause we liked each other.  We wanted to see each other again and due to work, I understood it was hard to schedule much.

He starting texting less saying he was just busy.  Even though I could take it as a sign that he lost interest, he actually agreed to meeting up for a weekly date night thing we planned plus some other stuff in the future he wanted me to go with him to.  So I tried not to think much of it, but again the texting got less and less compared to the first week we started talking where it was non-stop all night even when he was at work.  Then over the weekend, I texted him just to chat and he didn't answer at all.  Then the next day I asked if we were still on for the weekly date night thing, no answer.  Yet, he gets on grindr and facebook.

I'm not naive.  I know that guys just lose interest sometimes even if things are going well, but it's just confusing since he said yes to a date night and future plans.  In my mind, I'm thinking why would a guy do that if he's just going to reject me?  I haven't texted him in like 2 days now and it drives me crazy that he hasn't even bothered to at least say, ""Hey, not interested anymore"" or something.  Should I just let it go and move on?

","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello, I&amp;#39;m a gay person living in France, I&amp;#39;m 20 and I&amp;#39;m at university. I came out to more or mess everyone a few months and nothing ago and bad has happened because of it. 
For some reason I&amp;#39;ve been feeling extremely depressed and I have no more self esteem ever since. It&amp;#39;s Just getting worse and worse and now I feel like I can&amp;#39;t take it anymore. I haven&amp;#39;t been to classes or seen my friends for the last week or so and I feel like killing myself. Is This a normal stage after coming out? I don&amp;#39;t have gay friends to ask and i don&amp;#39;t want to talk about This with people I know. Please help me I can&amp;#39;t go on feeling like This I really can&amp;#39;t. &lt;/p&gt;

Who uses them?  Are there some brands better than others?  I guess I don't really understand the point of them?  I'm thinking about trying some but have no idea where to start....
