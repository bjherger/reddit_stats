So I have decided to explore my sexuality a bit and have started using Tinder/okCupid to meet guys in my area.

So far things are going well and I have met a really cool guy that I like a lot, and coincidentally we have both ""liked"" each other on both okCupid and Tinder.

We have hung out a few times now and honestly I am having hard time reading him. We are both masculine/straight acting so thus far really haven't been all that flirty. Honestly when we hang out it feels as if I am hanging with a bro as we talk cars etc. 

Last couple times we have hung out it has been at my place sitting on the couch, watching tv. He sits with his arms crossed, however we sit fairly close, almost touching shoulders. The arms crossed body language usually indicates to me ""don't touch me"" and try to counter act this with very open body language as I sit next to him. And when we hug goodbye its a close hug, not side hug or anything. Very confusing to my normally straight self who in the past has only dated girls and seen guys as friends.

Honestly, I am not sure what to read of it. I can't tell if he is only looking for a bro or something more. I kind of want to ask him, but I don't want to make it awkward because if anything I would like to have him as a friend.

Opinions on what to do would be appreciated.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey gaybros,

Here's the thing. I'm 26, just came out of the closet a year ago, and don't have too much experience with the whole dating thing...

Around last August, I started dating someone for the first time. He was a friend of a friend, unbelievably cute, smart, funny, a bit of a nerd but still masculine...the whole shebang, really. He was my 'type' before I really even knew what my type was. We got along really well, we liked the same things, and I really felt like I could be myself around him...which was not something I'd ever felt before.

We only dated for three months when he sort of unexpectedly broke things off. At the time I was really hurt and confused, and needed more information for me to try and get some sort of closure. I gave him a month, and then asked him if he would sit with me for a cup of coffee and talk a bit. We met, and he basically told me that he still had things he needed to work through from a previous relationship - he found himself feeling angry, sometimes at me, for things that were not at all my fault and didn't think it was fair to me for us to keep seeing each other when he felt this way. I told him that I appreciated his honesty, and that I could respect that he needs his time alone. We agreed that we got along well together, and while he said that he would call me if/when he works through his stuff that he didn't want me to just wait around for him. The conversation was nice, though, in that we didn't just talk about that kind of stuff...we were able to laugh together, talk about a show that we had been watching together that we were both keeping up on, normal-people stuff.

I want to disclaim that I don't intend on just 'waiting around'. It's been a few months now, and I've been out on a couple of dates with some people that I've met online...but none of them have made me feel the way he did. I know that it's clichéd for someone to say this about the first ever person they dated, but I really feel like he was special. I think we could have had something really great together, and the thought of something as silly as bad timing ruining that drives me crazy. There are days when I feel like messaging him, just to see how he's doing, might not be a bad idea, but then the other part of me says that I should let him be the one to come back if he wants to.

I used to do the gay teams, groups (i even organized one) and bars and all that but found the people equally flakey, not good for me as a person, or living a separate life in the city than myself.  The numbers of attendees started to be of older men who didn't use social media. 

I am a grad student and in my ads and chatting they know I am busy and really want to plan a face to face meeting instead of endlessly texting. Often ... These guys initiate contact with me (past 2 weeks 10 guys have flaked or faded). These are people I wasted lots of time chatting with and making plans, getting numbers and texting. All of them are late 20s to early 40s and have jobs. 

I also get sick of initiating the conversation on text when these guys seem distant and play the aloof hard to get, play games, or simply don't respond (maybe respond weeks latter). Are they using these apps to get a self esteem boost and then jerk off/ find someone new /fucking with people/or are shy and get scared. Seems like that would all take too much effort. 

We plan a date and I check in say a day before, everything seems ok or they seem cautious but interested, then they will not log into the app for a few days to avoid you or block you. IF you text, radio silence so you end up acting like a fool and wondering what you did or if you said something. They keep chatting online and then never want to meet.

&lt;p&gt;I used to do the gay teams, groups (i even organized one) and bars and all that but found the people equally flakey, not good for me as a person, or living a separate life in the city than myself.  The numbers of attendees started to be of older men who didn&amp;#39;t use social media. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a grad student and in my ads and chatting they know I am busy and really want to plan a face to face meeting instead of endlessly texting. Often ... These guys initiate contact with me (past 2 weeks 10 guys have flaked or faded). These are people I wasted lots of time chatting with and making plans, getting numbers and texting. All of them are late 20s to early 40s and have jobs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also get sick of initiating the conversation on text when these guys seem distant and play the aloof hard to get, play games, or simply don&amp;#39;t respond (maybe respond weeks latter). Are they using these apps to get a self esteem boost and then jerk off/ find someone new /fucking with people/or are shy and get scared. Seems like that would all take too much effort. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We plan a date and I check in say a day before, everything seems ok or they seem cautious but interested, then they will not log into the app for a few days to avoid you or block you. IF you text, radio silence so you end up acting like a fool and wondering what you did or if you said something. They keep chatting online and then never want to meet.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do I play this game better? What do I look for. Tips?&lt;/p&gt;

I'm after some advice. Worried about HIV more than anything.

I'm bi, not out, still kinda new to my expierences with men. Basically, I hooked up with a random guy last night after chatting online for a few weeks. He seemed very expierenced, much more so than me. We were just touching, kissing and blowing each other. Then at some point I fingered and rimmed him a bit, and then we sort of got a bit caught up in the moment. He hopped on me and I sort of slid it in, but I went soft and ran out of lube so we went back to jerking and sucking. Penetration lasted 10 seconds at most. Not even sure whether it properly went in or not. There was no exchange of cum, since I basically didn't. He did later on, but on his belly. I know he wanted to swallow my load though. It struck me afterwards that if he wanted to do all that with me, he has probably done that with other people.

I messaged him earlier to discuss it with him. He says he's clean, but obviously even  if he's being honest that's no guarantee.

I'm going to go to a clinic tomorrow and speak to a doctor (would a doctor even do anything for this level of contact?). Just looking for someone to talk to about it since I'm freaking out a bit and have no one else to talk to really.

Feel free to scold me, though I know I was a reckless idiot.

Firstly he suffers with BDD and so taking pictures without his consent is a big no no, I have to wait until he's comfortable and then he'll take it. And then other things like he sometimes gets uncomfortable if I sit on his right side as he believes it is his bad side (even know his face is perfectly symmetrical which he doesn't believe). But these aren't really big problems, it bothers me to see him upset and not being able to help or convince him but it doesn't bother me per se. 

Borderline means that on bad days (which can sometimes last weeks bar the odd day or a few hours) he can become very distant, he isn't rude or angry or anything but when hanging around with him when like that I feel very alone despite being with my boyfriend, usually we're very affectionate so it's difficult to suddenly have the door closed and be running towards him but keep hitting a glass wall, being pushed back. 

We make sure to communicate and tell each other how we feel and he's aware of its effect and has talked about his self hate because of how it can make me feel, whenever there's a problem in the relationship we address it and get past it yet there's nothing we can do here and as someone who likes to fix things it obviously frustrates me. I don't like bringing it up now though since It's old news and it'll just make him feel down and hence worsen the problem but I cant help how I feel.

I grew up in a very conservative Christian household, so while I was never taught to hate gays or anyone in general, the environment I grew up in was very condescending about the whole homosexuality issue. To be gay was a sin, basically.

Anyway, I've found that over the past two or three years, I've become more and more bicurious. I go through periods of time where I just crave sexual activity with a guy. I've never actually done anything, but I get this urge that's so strong. I've gone on Grindr before and were it not for currently having a girlfriend probably would've ended up hooking up with a few people by now, but because of that it's been kept to chatting with other guys. I like finding a guy to click with. My taste in porn will occasionally go to all men, and it does the trick for me like none other.

And yet, despite all this, I'm not attracted to men. At least not totally. I can look at picture after picture of what guys consider to be attractive men, and to me they're just that, guys. I can look at a guy and recognize that he is attractive, but it's more from like a woman's perspective, or what I think a girl would think about how he looks, if that makes any sense. There's no physical attraction. I can walk through the mall for an hour and find 50 girls I'm attracted to and not one guy.

To be honest and blunt, I'm not attracted to most men, but I'm attracted to gay sex. I can watch porn and get off to two guys going at it, but I don't pay attention to what they look like, I pay attention to what they're doing. I'm attracted to male anatomy. It looks like something I'd really like to try.

Now here's the catch when I say I'm not attracted to guys. While I'm not attracted to men in general, there is always a certain type I look for whenever I want to chat or cam or whatever. Certain body types, certain ages, so on and so forth. There's a specific type of person I look for, and if a hook up ever happens, I would want it to be with the kinda guy I prefer. Not trying to sound like a dick, but everybody has their preferences. I find these types of guys more attractive than anyone else, but at the same time I don't feel the same attraction towards them as I would with say, a gorgeous female.

Just a little breakdown of my situation:

I (31) met this guy on an app (36). He is a very sweet, friendly, and attractive. We went on a first date, we had dinner and drinks it went very well. We were very touchy feely and made out a little at the end of the night.

Some scheduling issues arose so it took about a week and a half to see him again. Right after that first date I started crushing pretty hard on him. What I would definitely describe as limerence. 

We met for our second date and it was pretty good ,though not as good as the first. It felt a little more awkward in terms of the convo (though I have to say I am a very introverted and shy person so it takes me a while to warm up to people, and this time we were not drinking). We had dinner the second date and watched a movie. Part with kissing. We were somewhat touchy with each other.

However, after the second date I definitely felt the limerence fade. I have seen him about 4 more times since then. The last two of which have involved sex, cuddling, kissing, back rubs and that kind of stuff. 

I am just confused about how I am feeling and where things should be going. I do like him, and we have a lot of interests in common, and I am sexually attracted to him. But I became a little concerned that the limerance/crush faded so quickly. I don't know if this is normal because I feel like all my old past crushes were unrequited so they went away unfulfilled on their own lol.

I find myself doubting whether I want to start a relationship with this guy. A little background, I haven't been in a serious relationship since 2010 (a six year relationship). I have dated here and there but nothing has developed. I don't know if this is my introverted/shy nature being nervous about a relationship, the fact that I have not been in one for so long..or maybe because I was friends with my previous partner prior to getting into a relationship.

I feel as though something isn't quite meshing completely and I don't know if its me or what. I'd hate to throw away a good thing if there is no reason to. 

There has been no discussion of starting a relationship with this guy, beyond him stating he wanted to take it slow, which I agreed with.

What do you bros think?

What I wanted to know was, how accurate is the gps on grindr? Not that I'm paranoid that people will find me or anything, but I see a lot of guys who it says are within like 80 meters, but I think most of them speak a different language. (Not Italian)

What I mean to say is that theres a ton of people who speak french, german or other languages (one really cute guy was speaking slovanian) and some of them even wrote that they are in places like paris or cities that are hundreds of kilometers away. I'm too paranoid to actually message them (I'll get the courage eventually). And I know that my phone gps functions perfectly.

With that stated I will try my best to paint the picture for all of you. For obvious reasons this is a throwaway account .

So about a year ago my boyfriend was sexually assaulted on a university function trip. The offender of the crime was a friend of my boyfriend who is also gay, and had expressed that he had feelings for my boyfriend many times. This person just so happened to be my boyfriend's roommate on said trip, and they were forced to share a bed. That night he and many other people that are in the same organization as him went out drinking, everyone was some level of inebriated including my boyfriend and his roommate. When they came back to the hotel and went to bed my boyfriend woke up shortly thereafter to find his roommate cuddling him with his hand down his pants groping him. He immediately was startled, embarrassed, scared, and all of the emotions that go along with a situation like this. He didn't tell anyone about it including me until he got home from the trip. He insisted that his roommate was simply drunk and was not thinking about what he was doing. He didn't want to deal with the embarrassment of saying something to anyone of authority about what happened to him. I immediately took issue with this approach, but we were still in the early phases of our relationship so i decided that it was not my place to tell him how to live his life. 

Fast forward a few months to last summer and again this same organization goes on a trip and again the same thing happens. Same exact situation. He called me that night crying after it happened, I myself was out of town and so was he. I have never felt so helpless than I did that night, not able to comfort him, not able to protect him. All i could do was tell him that everything was going to be okay. Again he dint want to say anything because at the time he wasn't out as gay and he simply didnt want to be the source of drama. 

After this happened he admitted to me that before he even met me this same person had sexually assaulted him inside a nightclub when he was drunk. Again it was only groping and no penetration or an effort to do so was ever made. So this has happened now on at least three separate occasions within the past year and I'm simply fed up with it. 

I have no idea how to handle this, and really I'm not sure that there is any way to truly handle something like this correctly. We have no money for a legal process, obviously me hurting him wouldn't help anything, and beyond that im not sure what direction to turn. 

In case anyone was wondering, this guy is still around and still very much a part of my boyfriends everyday life and I cant imagine it ever gets easy having to pretend that nothing is wrong. My only concern is my boyfriend and I just need to figure out how to handle this. Any advice on how to go about it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks. 


***EDIT***

For those that are asking, my boyfriend has confronted this guy every time it has happened. He and I actually talked about the situation quite a bit this afternoon and all he could say over and over was that he knows what happened was wrong, but he couldn't live with himself if he ""ruined this guys life"". My boyfriend is one of the sweetest, most caring people I know and even in a situation as rough as this one he refuses to think only of himself. Don't agree with this approach but if that's what he feels than who am I to tell him he is wrong.

Unfortunately I asked my boyfriend if there was anyone in his department that he would feel comfortable enough and trust enough to talk to and he said no. I agree that going to the police is a bit extreme of a measure in this situation, after all it wasn't a violent situation and there is no getting around the fact that if the law gets involved its going to get ugly for my boyfriend. 

I am not a violent person, but i have never in my life wanted to hurt someone more than I do right now. I have a totally new understanding and empathy for any victim of sexual crime. There can't be a more helpless feeling in the world.
