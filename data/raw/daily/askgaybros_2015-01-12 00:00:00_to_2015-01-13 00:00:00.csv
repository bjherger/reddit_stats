I matched with this guy on tinder. He's from near Washington DC. About 2 hours away from me. We talked on and off that summer and became friends. However, we never met. 

Then he decided to come up to visit me for the first time on my birthday. This was the end of the September. I am usually a super shy and awkward person, but I felt so comfortable around him. He seemed comfortable with me also. Of course we went out and ended up coming back to my place and sleeping together.

Then about 2 weekends later I went to DC to visit him. Just hung out and stuff. We continued to talk etc but I didn't see him again in person until last weekend. He took me to dinner and then we went out to a few bars, went back to his place and of course slept together.

Then this weekend I went to NYC. I was by myself. Then he texts me asking if he can up with me, so he did. He took the train from DC to NYC. I honestly feel like a couple, we hold hands, kiss, both comfortable around each other. He'd grab my hand in the taxi. It's not always me making the first move. He also made it a point to include me in his snap stories and he's a fairly private guy when it comes to that stuff.

I can't believe I've only seem him in person four times. I feel so comfortable around him and the more that I see him the harder I fall for him. The problem isn't that he doesn't like me. He definitely does. It is just that he doesn't know that if the distance would work it out. I also think he is a little afraid of commitment. 

My dilemma is, do I want to keep seeing him and hanging out with him if it just continues to make me fall for him or do I want to lose a really good friend?

What would you do? (Yes I tried talking to him about it but he didn't feel comfortable discussing it in a McDonalds. We were waiting for megabus to pick him up) I feel like I am going to hold off on bringing it up since I literally just got done seeing him but I definitely plan on talking to him about.

I am going to propose. We don't have a ton of money, but we're stable and happy. We aren't in a position to spend thousands of dollars on jewelry. My grandfather has some nice rings and he is willing to give me one to use as an engagement ring. Here is where it gets (maybe) creepy. My grandfather was remarried, and his new wife (who has now passed on) had some jewelry that may or may not have belonged to one of his new wife'deceased ex husbands and they are now the property of my grandfather. 

Is it creepy to use one of these rings as an engagement ring? I'm not sure if it would creep my so out if he knew the ring's origin, and I would feel horrible if the knowledge tainted the experience of me proposing. I would not withhold the information from him but I wouldn't tell him right there. I almost feel like duh yes it's creepy, but then again why let a beautiful expensive ring go to waste?

It probably began around 8th grade. As a young child, I was somewhat entranced by male nudity, but had no means of satiating my curiosity. Nothing happened until about 7th grade when I began looking at gay porn ultimately. I first rationalized that by telling myself I was just curious about how I'd look physically after puberty. I wouldn't let myself even think about being gay and wanted to stop my viewing of porn due to religious guilt and the sexual repression within the religion I have been raised in. This went on until the middle of my sophomore year. I finally thought, ""you know what? I'm okay being gay."" I even came out to a couple of close  friends and thought of myself as bisexual and later gay. During the next year, I was in a band and wished I was straight to conform better, but then I was kicked out of the band. That is when i began to requestion my sexuality a lot more again. I am in a cycle of thinking I'm gay and then straight.

I have been attracted to girls, but mostly emotionally and personality-wise. Vaginas scare me. I've never had sex with either sex, but I find it easier to fantasize about guys. I don't want to be gay, on the other hand. I feel as though I would alienate my family due to their religion and beliefs. I would never fit in with them again, with maybe one exception. I also feel like I need a female presence if I ever wanted kids, but no offense to anyone, but I can't see myself ending up with a femine guy.

I've been lurking here now for a while now and figured its time that I ask something for myself. My question isn't about boys or sex but rather what should I be doing at this point in my life?

I just graduated college with a bachelors in business, buuuut I'm jobless at the moment. I've been applying to several company's, but my career goal is to get into a slightly different field than what my studies were in. I want to get into web analytics and marketing. So to do so, I've been networking with some industry professionals, and reading technical books about the topics. I hope to start hearing back from these companies and get a foothold in the industry.

So I have a bunch of free time, what do I do with it? Its strange not having classes to prepare for. I've been working on getting in better shape for the past year, and have kicked that into overdrive since I graduated because of all the free time. I severely cut back on drinking. I'm trying to read more. I just finished the first book I've read for fun in a long time. I have an overseas trip planned next month to some place very warm to visit family (Get me away from this cold pls). 

Besides that I'm not doing much. Its relaxing sure, but I wish I had more to do and be productive with. I'm thinking of picking up photography again. 

So my issues:

1. Getting a job. This kind of terrifies me. One, because I want a job I wont hate. Two, the job market is very competitive. Three, I have a mild stutter, which although inst that bad can get worse when I'm nervous, AKA interviews. I have enough money saved up to last me a few months before i ideally land a job. 

2. What to do with all this free time? I have working out and reading, but that can only go so far.

3. Staying motivated. I was doing good for a while, and the past few days I slipped by waking up too late and being very unproductive in general.

TLDR: I'm not dying, I'm not not sexually repressed, no ones breaking up with me. I feel like I should be doing more with my life, I'm just not sure what.

Thanks for taking the time to read this if you did

My boyfriend and I have been considering the move from our small college town of Tallahassee to the west coast. We haven't set our GPS for a specific city yet and aren't planning to move until July when our lease expires here. We are fortunate enough to work in the medical industry so we are likely to have no real issues getting a job (assuming we try) but I have a few questions for you all:


1. What is a city you'd recommend for us? We have been together for four years now so we are most certainly stable - we are primarily considering LA, Portland, Seattle, and Denver. 


2. Have any of you moved across country? How was it and how much money should we have in the bank for the move? Neither of us have anything that can't fit in our vehicles that we are unwilling to abandon so that should keep our costs down.


3. Is there anything else we should know? It's our first move away from our parents (who all reside in Florida) so I'm trying to make sure we do everything correctly.

I know it's the rule never to love your straight best friend. I've lost my other friend by confessing to him that I had feelings for him so I am mindful of mistakes I am prone to committing. I am not out, some may know but are not sure. This is High school btw.



Anyway, we met 2 years ago in a school competition. I was a junior he was a sophomore. We never really thought we'd be best friends come a year after. We started chatting on Facebook after the summer break. He always messaged me about how he ended up with the worst math teacher ever. I, being a senior, didn't actually pay too much attention to underclassmen 'cause they all think it's cool to have a senior friend. I didn't ignore him altogether, just didn't reply with much enthusiasm. This was the time when I confessed to my other friend and got rejected badly by him cutting things off and awkwardly trying to patch things up. I figured I'd go hang out with my underclassman friend while adjusting to leaving that social group. He'd been asking if we could walk home together for some time. (I didn't classify this as weird because my mind was in another place. I dismissed it as another attempt to look cool with a senior.) Our schedules were different so I had to wait for him. I was deliberately avoiding my friends so they wouldn't ask me why I'm not going home on time. We would always walk home and maybe grab a bite. It went on for a semester. We were at the same state of mind that we were best friends. I was forgetting my rejection and thoughts about having feelings for my best friend were beginning to float in my brain. I rejected my thoughts because I thought if it were just feelings to replace the old ones, it would be plain wrong. The school fair came. A week where students do nothing or participate in programs by the school. It was time where we could hang out freely. It was still weird being best friends with a junior. That week hanging out with him mostly, made me realize my feelings were really there. But I was still afraid if I was forcing myself to get another love interest. Christmas break, he asked if we could go out to lunch. My heart skipped a beat. I acted normally and said yes. It wasn't a date, I think. I didn't want to jump to conclusions and fall helplessly in love. When he was waiting for his order, he asked me about my father (I never met my father since birth.) He asked, ""Would you like my father to be yours to?"" I stuttered, panicked, and looked for another topic to avoid answering. After that he goes to our classroom more often, to ask about borrowing things or just passing by to, I dunno, show off that he knows an upperclassman. The 2nd semester was ending and mother was being more of a jerk than usual which triggered a fight between us. The fight was horrible(not bloody kind but you know, not talking for months) In that time, I started texting him coz the wifi password was constantly being changed. He always texted me to text him back months before but I always replied through Facebook coz I didn't feel like giving time for him would be worth it. Moving on, I texted him about leaving the house for good and made plans on how I would live life. He replied to me that he would leave their house to go with me. It struck me that maybe, just maybe he felt something for me. But being too cautious, I disregarded any kind of subtext I can pull from his replies. My mother and I fixed our problem and my desire to run away disappeared. I told him, that I won't need to leave anymore. He told me that I just wanted someone to share bills with. When I started playing League of Legends, he asked if we could share accounts. There I met his neighborhood friends asking who I was or if something was going on between us, I never asked him about it nor did he ask me. The language filter vanished when we did share. He would use more profane words and talk about girls what he wants to do with them. This change is what led me to post here. I am not sure anymore of what to do with my feelings. After almost a year and a half of build up of what one might consider hints or clues. The sudden change is what confuses me. Many times I wanted to tell him but thought, if he likes me back he could tell me first, coz all the pieces were too good to be true so I was being careful. 


**TL;DR**: My best friends actions vaguely says he's into me but suddenly his behaviour says otherwise.

I've followed a few gaybros subs and a recurring theme seems to be gays falling for straight friends. I confess that's happened in the past, but now I seem to be in the exact opposite situation. Apologies in advance for the wall of text, I've been nursing a bottle of wine this evening.

I'm an american who's lived abroad for almost 10 years. A few months ago I met a guy working on a university project. First impression of the guy is that he's 110% gay (not flamboyant or anything, but my gaydar practically broke). He's also american and we became friends quite quickly.

Since then our friendship has kinda exploded and we're best friends. We practically hang out every day and it's rare for us not to be in contact in some way for longer than a day. We've talked about lots of really big and personal things, and along the way I told him I'm gay. He's only gone so far as to confess being possibly asexual. He does occasionally spout out comments like ""___ is so HOT"" both about celebrities and mutual friends whom are girls. However they all are girls that are in relationships already.

We also have had several what my friends would classify as dates, e.g. dinner and a movie (at least 4 times), me cooking him dinner at my place (at least 10 times), him buying takeout/coffee/lunch (at least 10 times). We also keep saying ""oh we have to go to *insert restaurant name here*!""

Over the past month though, I've begun to suspect that he might have feelings for me. It started when a mutual friend asked if we were a couple, since as she phrased it we're practically ""glued at the hip"". Any time I ask for help or just want to hang out, he's always there. He's helped me move furniture into my apartment, when I ask to borrow a screwdriver he's here within 30 minutes, etc. He's even admitted to mutual friends that my apartment is practically his second home, as he's here so often. He also seems to make a point of sending messages at random just to initiate a conversation, and he's called me many times around midnight just to talk, ending up in 10-20 minute long conversations. We're each others' ""top friends"" on snapchat, and in the time I've known him 5 of the 7 total posts on his facebook page since september 2014 are things I've tagged him in (he's a bit private on facebook).

I travelled back to the US for the holidays and him down to southern Sweden so we didn't see each other for 3 weeks. The day I left, he sent me [this link](http://6abc.com/432781/) before visiting me and accompanying me to the ~~subway~~ airport (*ninja edit*).

When we both met up after the holidays, he wanted to meet me immediately when his train arrived at the station &amp; we had a coffee (that he paid for) at like 20.45 in the evening. He also bought me a gift, a semi-expensive wine carafe (he said it was so we could drink wine together 'in style') and confessed that he also bought me a pair of shoes - and that he secretly checked my shoes just to make sure he ordered the right size.

What I'm certain of is that he doesn't act the same with any of his other guy or girl friends - the closest was a mutual girl friend who got a bag of candy as a gift.

And so I feel I'm caught in a delicate situation. I really love him as my best friend, but I'm not sure how I feel about a potential relationship. Naturally I need to have a talk with him to clear the air. But I'm afraid that I'm going to fuck up the conversation and I really want to keep him as a friend.

Gaybros out there, how can I talk this over with him without making things awkward or fucking things up? What should I do?

*edit:* forgot to mention he likes to consider himself a 'puppetmaster' and as such has an incredible ability to avoid answering questions. I'm one of the few who won't let him get away with it, but this subject feels too loaded to pressure him into answering.

*edit 2:* I hate the uncertainty but all my questions sound like shit. ""Are you gay? Do you like me? What's going on here?"". Yeah. I'm cringing too.

**tl;dr     best friend might be interested, I'm not sure because I over-analyse everything. I don't like uncertainty and don't want to hurt him, so I need to talk with him. Business major, not communications, so I can't words.**","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long time lurker here.

I will see him in a couple of months, i know i am very lucky for that, however the longest we have ever been apart was 2 weeks.

Especially during quick fucking, you can see a bit of the skin stretched around your cock pull back a bit with it. Regardless of how relaxed his sphincter muscles are, the skin in that area gets stretched back a bit whenever I'm pulling back before thrusting again.

It's just a thin layer of skin that's pulling out with it, but I always worry that over time this must start to pull on the muscles and lead to some sort of prolapse. Or that the skin will continue to stretch over time. Is it more a case of the skin loosens a bit when a guy is new to having anal sex and then reaches a point where it stops, and is no longer a problem?

The guy I'm seeing right now is only in his early 20s and I don't want to hurt or damage him, and I want him to be able to enjoy bottoming for years to come. But whenever I see the skin around a guy's asshole doing this I worry that I'm slowly injuring him or that it's a progressive sort of issue over time. For reference, I'm only a bit thicker than average, pretty average sized dick overall, and always use plenty of lube and make sure my partner is comfortable.

I know this is a very in-detail topic, haha, but anyone who has anecdotes from their own sex life or knowledge of the anal area might be able to offer some thoughts. I'd also like to hear from bottoms on if they've noticed any problems over time or if they've noticed any changes in their anal area over time from bottoming.
