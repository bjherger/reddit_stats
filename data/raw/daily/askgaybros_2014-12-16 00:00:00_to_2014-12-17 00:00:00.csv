We saw each other, but he never talked to me for the entire afternoon, either one sentence convos, and never initiated a convo either. just made me third wheel the entire time and he just talked to his mate, made me feel like total shit. Told him this at the end how he just doesn't realise how his actions affect people, told him to stop contacting me, because he shuts people away emotionally after promising that he won't. 

I then get [this](http://imgur.com/a/hqJaL) 

 this morning. Despite everything I could tell he needed me. So I'm there for him and he shuts me off. Again. I rip into him and then he tells me what's actually bothering him. And it's pretty serious. 

He's done this three times now. Opening up, I try to console him and he either rebukes it, or pretends he can't remember what's he texted and he deleted the convo. I actually know this little girl, and I really hope she's alright.

We chatted for about 3 days before it happened. We decided to meet at a park and we hit it off straight away that we talked about anything for a long time until he invited me to come over to his place.

Once we got to his place, we started to get flirty with each other while he pour some drinks to start the night and soon after it was sexy time. Things were amazing and as we finished each other off, it didn't stopped when we got into the shower together. It was really late and I asked if I could stay the night in which he was kindly obliged to. We put on our clothes and talked some more.

Now, usually when I go for a hookup, it was just hi, sexy time, thanks and see ya. This time it was different. After he took out the extra bed for me to sleep in, I thought we were gonna call it a night, but it led to us spending the night chatting until he initiated to cuddle on the couch. I didn't think too much of it and just went for it. Mind you, this was the first time I actually cuddled with someone post-sex. 

What's interesting is that he then took off all his clothes and asked me if I wanted to cuddle with him in the extra bed. Again, I said yes and it was a nice feeling. What struck me is when he started to say things like, ""look what you did to me (in a good way)"" and ""you're definitely my type and you look better in person."" He then proceeded to sleep in his own bed. The next morning, we fucked again and followed by breakfast at a nearby cafe. 

That was Sunday. We still text each other, just everyday how's it going, how was your day normal stuffs until he asked me if I wanted to help him pick some gifts before our next encounter. Correct me if I'm wrong, I took that as a subtle question to go on a date. I haven't really said yes because I still have mixed feelings about all these. We had only met once and I think we are just infatuated with each other.

I guess my question is, **""Is it normal for FWB to cuddle, flirt, texts and date without any expectation to have a relationship out of it?""** I enjoy his company and the sex, but he is 15+ years older than me and I could not see myself dating someone with that age gap. His Grindr age is 9 years younger until he told me.

**tl;dr Met an amazing guy who's 15+ years older than me. We hit it off and we agreed we were only looking for fun.

I'm a newly out gay guy and was looking for some advice as I have very little experience dating.

I've been chatting and hanging out with this guy since the beginning of the month. We both agreed early on to take it slow and see where things end up. We both want a relationship, but his actions over the past few days have made me wonder if that's even true. 

A little background. I first met this guy back in October, we exchanged info and chatted for a bit before I started dating my now ex-boyfriend. After the whole breakup thing, I started browsing the typical apps. This guy messaged me and asked how I been. We are both car guys and I enjoy talking with him about that. We also get along on a personal level and he's totally my type. So naturally I asked him out on a date and he agreed. 

The date went super well and we ended up cuddling watching tv at his place. Since then we have made an effort to see each other everyday except for the last 3 days or so. He keeps canceling our plans due to ""fatigue"" from work. Which is fine. What gets me though is I plan my day around seeing him and he ends up canceling usually 30 minutes before we are due to see each other. He tells me he's tired and needs to go to bed. I exasperatedly agree, get a little disappointed, and go do something else. 

I'm an adult, I can handle this, however what is starting to get to me is he doesn't go to sleep. In fact he usually goes for a drive and texts me a pic or something. I bite my tongue and comment on what he sends, not asking why he isn't doing what he said he would do. If he can't sleep why doesn't he just come see me? Where he's driving to is twice the distance it is to my place. At least at my place he could relax a little and I would get to see him. The other thing is he takes forever to respond when I text him, like 4 or 5 hours sometimes. 

I'm suppose to see him tonight, but I'm pretty sure he's going to cancel that too. So what I am asking is, am I just spinning my wheels here? I'm starting to think he isn't into me, which is fine, but I don't like being strung along. 


Any advice? 

If I do see him tonight I plan on asking him what's up between us and where it's headed cause this is frustrating as hell. 

UPDATE: Sorry for the delay, forgot about this. 

So we ended up having that talk. He ended up canceling, but I told him we needed to chat. He said okay and we met up. Turns out he's been going through some personal crap. I told him for this to work he needs to tell me what's up or at least open up about it. Mostly past relationship issues were rearing their heads and we talked it through. Also dealt with the person causing it. We were able to discuss likes and dislikes in relationships where I brought up my concerns. He apologized for being kinda distant and ended up thanking me for ""forcing"" him to confront it. Things have been great ever since and as of today we are a couple.

Having exclusively watched heterosexual porn in my formative years, at some point my eyes turned toward gay porn. Initially, I tried to justify it as simply 'experimenting' or 'curiosity', but gradually I began to come to terms with my own sexuality.

At 19 years old, I'm now quite comfortable admitting to myself, and to one extremely close friend, that I'm attracted to men. However, I can't bring myself to be totally honest with my family and friends about my sexuality. 

Fortunately, my parents have always been supportive of me in everything I do and I'm almost certain that they would continue to love and support me if I did come out. But I still can't summon the courage to come clean, based largely on a likely misguided notion that, as their only son, my coming out would be a huge disappointment.

I've always portrayed the typical heterosexual image to my friends. Deep down I think I know that they would still accept me for who I am if I were to come out. Still, as an avid rugby player, I feel compelled to live up to the macho-standards they set. I fear that coming out would not live up to these standards.

I don't see myself as someone who is stereotypically or ostensibly gay, and have no reason to suspect that any of my friends or family would have cause to think I am. But I know how unhealthy it is to bottle up who I am. 

I don't really know what I'm asking you /r/askgaybros, but I feel like I needed to confront the lingering feeling that I have to be open about who I am to my friends and family.

We lived together and grew up together in a big city. We were like brothers.

Time has gone on, I went to law school, one guy spent a few years in South America, another bounced around from city to city, but we all basically have moved back to our college city and are still in the same circle. I was the one that moved back most recently, so I have been working to try and be a part of the group again.

This weekend, I went to a rally with one of the guys, let's call him Chris. The others were supposed to be there too, but bailed because they were preparing for a party. I hadn't heard about it, so I asked Chris what was going on, and he said that it was because one of the other dudes was going to roast a turkey and have people over for dinner. I didn't think anything of it because Chris didn't say anything about it being a big deal.

Fast forward to later that night, I see pictures on Facebook and a big spread with all of my friends from college including Chris having dinner. I was hurt, and still am.

I've slept on this a couple days, but I still feel upset. What do I do? Who do I tell that I am upset? Do I move on from these people, or do I let it slide? I can't remember the last time my feelings were this hurt. I don't know what to do.

Firstly, lately I've been feeling distant from friends and family. Feeling very David Fisher from 6 feet under when he begs God to help him cure his loneliness and suffering. I've yet to come to terms 100 percent with who I am and I just feel like this has opened up so many questions for me. 

I'm 19, from NYC. We went to middle school and high school together. We took the same classes, went on the same trips and always travelled and stayed with each other. We have so much in common and just always enjoyed each other's company. 

That night, I just don't know how it started. It was late. The kissing was immense and then it went further. There was obvious passion and I'm actually nursing a couple of bite marks from when I got a little too into it. it was good but afterwards he assured me that at least he knew now that he 'wasn't like that'. 

It was just a buzzkill and tbh, I don't know about my sexuality. I'm so confused. This wasn't even my first sexual encounter with a male but I have this bad image of myself that maybe I'm just greedy? Even during the summer when I had a bit of a crush on this other guy, who liked me back I think I cut him out of my life because of the shame and what my family would think. Then I have this night of action, and I could lose my friend and further my descent into total loneliness. 

This is getting slightly off topic, but I feel that I didn't even perform that well on the night in question.

Obviously, my mind is going in overdrive.

I lost my virginity to a dude I met on this online gay community/hook-up site that I’ve mosly just been on for kicks, I never ever realistically thought that I’d meet up with anyone from there, especially since I think of myself as being a bit of a socially awkward person in real life, even around those I’m familiar with. It started with him messaging me obviously looking for some kind of hook-up, which I played along with (and which I’ve done a handful of times with other dudes there, only to consciously bail out on the last second because I could never picture myself actually going through with something like this). I found him really handsome when we exchanged face pics, and he was my age, which probably contributed to me taking this whole thing a step further, I think. I came over to his place under the agreement of “talking and watching a movie”. Even though I mostly felt like I was under this rush of bizarre excitement when I actually went over to the meeting place we had decided upon, thinking that I’d probably chicken out as soon as I got near there in any case, the fact that I’m a pretty lonely person and that this could lead to making a new contact with a person who for all I know could be my soulmate or someone I’d really connect with, is probably what pushed me all the way through with actually meeting him. It's not like I had anything to lose, you know?

The fact that we met under the circumstances we did made me feel more awkward and tense about talking to and approaching him than I’d normally feel, since I knew that he probably thought of this a sexual one-off thing (even though I still considered things ending like this to be inconceivable at this point, and pictured in my mind that I’d simply protest if he made any sexual advances). He was really cool when it came to the talking though, and even if I feel that we didn’t really properly break the ice until things eventually got sexual, things felt a lot less awkward than they could’ve felt.

We ate some food he had prepared, played some games, and eventually watched some randomly picked action movie. I couldn’t help but feel a bit tense during all of this since the circumstances we were in felt a bit unnatural to me, we hadn’t known each other until yesterday and the purpose of our interactions felt a bit directionless; I couldn’t really tell if he wanted to genuinely befriend me or if it all mostly was out of courtesy. Anyway, after the movie ended and time got late, he pretty much immediately got intimate. We were lying on a mattress on the floor, so it was a pretty convenient set-up for what he had in mind, heh. He got closer and started stroking my junk, and I pretty much instantly got wood. Don’t know how much more in detail it would be necessary to describe the sexual stuff, but the fact that this was the first time I had had intimate contact like this made me become really caught up in the moment, so I pretty much just went along with any of the advances he made. He was also taller and beefier than me, so he just had this dominant vibe to him that probably contributed to this.

Anyway, by the end of it all, I had lost both my oral and anal virginity, haha. I would’ve never in a million years have thought that I’d get someone’s schlong up my dirtbox during my first sexual encounter, knowing the type of person I am, but he was really dominantly passionate and persuasive with the way he went about with things that I’d feel like a buzzkill objecting when he actually got to the part where he inconspicuously ended up in a crotch-to-posterior position and brought out a condom out of nowhere. I also greatly enjoyed all that was going on at the moment, so I just couldn’t bring myself to properly object (although the anal part mostly ended up feeling uncomfortable, hah).

In retrospect though, I have really ambivalent feelings about it all. I feel some guilt about the losing my virginity the way I did, through an online one-night stand, and that once I have a proper relationship with someone, it will have ruined the novelty of the first “intimate” moment I will have with that person. The fact that I probably won’t be intimate with someone again in a good while, while now knowing how great it can feel also bothers me - and I’d feel way way too shameful about hooking up with a second person just to experience it once more and to then never see that person again. Meanwhile I also have this oddly unsatisfactory feeling because of the fact that (possible TMI, heh) we never kissed and he never did oral on me (he said that he had some kind of mouth sore or something), which have kind of left me urging to experience that in a sexual context  - although at the same time it kind of feels like a good thing, because of the novelty for that still remaining.

On the contrary, having some sexual experience like this does feel kind of good (although the magically enigmatic image I’ve always had of sex being gone feels a bit strange), and I’m content with losing it at my current age (with how things have been going for my social life, I realistically thought I’d lose it at the age of 20 at the earliest). Overall, I feel okay about it. Even though I felt really anxious about it right after and it’s only been a day since, I feel like I’m gonna deal with it okay. Maybe a bit regrettable, but not “list of things that will keep me awake at night for the rest of my life” kind of regrettable.

He called me his second day of winter break and left me.

I don't think I should get back together with him, but god I want to. 

We'll meet up when I'm home in a few days. He's said as much. But that leaves me miserable and basically incapable of studying as much as I should.

I'll break if I can't talk to him. He has told me he's acting tough because he'll break down if he doesn't, but I would feel so much better if we could just break down together.

Hi Gay Bros, So I'm a straight (ish) dude who has recently started experimenting with guys. 

On my way home from a night out i might head over to a gay bar and keep an eye out. Last month i got talking to a nice guy who, long story short gave me a blowjob. My being drunk at the time got really into it and finished in his mouth. 

But the next morning i started freaking out about possible STDs. I always have protected sex with women and I've read up about the subject multiple times, But the discussions are so vague and generally don't answer my questions. I know its not 100% safe and the chances of getting HIV are incredibly small from it. 

But what is the general consensus about unprotected oral sex, Do you guys in general not care pr worry about giving / receiving from a casual hook up? I've seen in porn that both girls and guys will often give a blowjob unprotected but then have protected sex.

I'm 22 and I currently live at home to save money, I have 2 younger brothers (18 and 15) and he has stated adamantly that he won't be taking the job if we don't want to come with him. 

So here's my issue: This is a really fucking good opportunity. For all of us, in a way, but mostly for my dad. Like, as a plant manager(which over there is like being the lord of a feudal manor.) in a country with no income taxes we're probably talking a couple million dollars kind of opportunity. I wouldn't really feel right about him opting out of it on my behalf, but it's motherfucking Saudi Arabia. Islam does not look kindly upon buggery, homosexuals are often lashed and executed. Not that I'm really concerned about that--all I have to do is not have sex with men--but the idea kind of gets to me. There haven't been any attacks on western compounds in Saudi Arabia since the 2004 massacres/bombings (lol) but who knows, right? I used to joke to myself that in spite of everything, at least I don't have to worry about being beheaded with a dull knife by Muslim radicals. Now it's actually a remote possibility, and I don't know whether to laugh or vomit. The crime rate in the country is extremely low, but the driving is apparently quite lethal. 


But aside from all the safety concerns, I wonder if this will also incur a death of the spirit. I don't see my life developing while I'm sitting in a compound village for 3 years (for obvious reasons you don't leave the compounds often) and there aren't really any education options for non citizens to pursue. Everybody keeps telling me that it's going to be a really rich cultural experience and blahblahblah but it seems like a cultural wasteland for anyone who isn't a Muslim male. Europe is only a stone's throw away, I suppose. I'd have to spend a lot of time in Europe. 

So I guess I'm not asking for any specific answers, just for your take on my situation, or how you would feel about it. 

Anyway, thanks for listening to me ramble. Not really sure what I'm expecting to get out of this post, just venting I guess. This is really huge and could change the course of my life forever so I'm a little overwhelmed.

&lt;p&gt;But aside from all the safety concerns, I wonder if this will also incur a death of the spirit. I don&amp;#39;t see my life developing while I&amp;#39;m sitting in a compound village for 3 years (for obvious reasons you don&amp;#39;t leave the compounds often) and there aren&amp;#39;t really any education options for non citizens to pursue. Everybody keeps telling me that it&amp;#39;s going to be a really rich cultural experience and blahblahblah but it seems like a cultural wasteland for anyone who isn&amp;#39;t a Muslim male. Europe is only a stone&amp;#39;s throw away, I suppose. I&amp;#39;d have to spend a lot of time in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I guess I&amp;#39;m not asking for any specific answers, just for your take on my situation, or how you would feel about it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, thanks for listening to me ramble. Not really sure what I&amp;#39;m expecting to get out of this post, just venting I guess. This is really huge and could change the course of my life forever so I&amp;#39;m a little overwhelmed. &lt;/p&gt;

I don't think I can coherently write down everything in my head. 

I'm in my early twenties, have a boyfriend who lives a thousand miles away from me, currently work and attend a uni course. I'm not out to most people I meet with daily.

I know that I'm the root of my problems:

I'm scared of failing university. Ok it isn't easy to fail with my current scores, but my interest in rapidly waning. I don't know why - I chose this subject because it would give me the best chance at my career. Despite what my boyfriend thinks, I'm not very intelligent. 

I hate where I work; it's authoritarian and well, I feel that there is no progression there. When you have responsibility taken away from you to 'reduce' resource usage and maximise efficiency, it sucks. It sucks when no one listens to you. It sucks when someone takes the credit for your work. My currently blocker to finding a new job is that I don't have any qualifications, and I've noticed that here, you will be discarded for not having a degree. I don't have sufficient experience to make up for it. 

I want my parents to be proud of their only and youngest son. They are religious conservative, I'm preparing for the worst and am thinking of avoiding it all by eloping with my boyfriend. He makes me happy and when I'm with him, I forget about everything else. Sometimes I wish I could just disappear. We've been together for about half a year now. How is it that two people who disliked each other end up being in a relationship with each other?

I am very, painfully, aware that men are visual creatures. I don't know why, but I want to feel wanted. I know I am wanted by my boyfriend, but my appetite is insatiable. I don't understand the drive for this validation. Maybe I want to feel prized? Maybe I want to feel relevant.

I've lost weight, I've done dangerous things to lose fat. Most people would't say I'm fat, yet I feel fat and ugly. I know I'm not optimal, and I am working to change it, but I don't know where to stop. I don't have a clear aim of what I'm trying to do but feel wanted. I don't feel attractive.

A place where I used to hang out, where I used to have a lot of respect for now just looks like a complete circle jerk of people praising the 'hot' men. I resent that. I can't escape people giving praise to other people just for their bodies, if it's not at work, it's the other place where I hang out. I want to escape from it all. It really is true that you are eternally forgiven for any mistake you have if you are popular. 

I look at myself in the mirror and only see what I want to be. I don't see what I've done ... and honestly, I don't even know what I've achieved. I don't have any self-worth.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I really don&amp;#39;t want to sound whiney, but here I&amp;#39;ll go.

This terrifies me.

He hasn't hurt me. I still love him and care for him very much. I want to do this as respectfully and honestly as possible. I don't think he has any plans of ending our relationship so this is going to surprise him.

But he is not healthy for me. He has a history of drug abuse and still abuses marijuana (4-5x a week) and occasionally opioids. He only communicates honestly and sincerely with me when he's struggling with something. When things are good (he recently got a high paying job straight out of college) he shrugs his shoulders and puts me on the backburner so he can party with his friends.

He is unable to empathize, not like he refuses to but I don't think his brain is capable of empathy. One day he'll call me needy and ask me for space and the next he'll call me distant and demand my instant attention. He is completely unable to see his hypocrisy, especially concerning his drug abuse.

I've tried changing myself to fit his lifestyle, but I'm done accommodating to his desires. I truly love him and had such high hopes for his future. He was going to code video games, travel the world, find his happiness. But now he's regressed into nothing more than a pleasure-seeking being. And I'm one of the things that makes him feel good. Sometimes.

Bottom line: He puts the 'high' over me. I don't feel valued. He denies his addictions. He only shows affection to me when it's convenient for him and demands my undying support.
