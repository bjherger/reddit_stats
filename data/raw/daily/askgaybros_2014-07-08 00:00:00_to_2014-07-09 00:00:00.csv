I can pay you and everything, and we can meet beforehand so you aren't just letting a creeper into your house.
If not, do any of you know anywhere/one?

I just want to vent about my fucked up life.


I'm a closeted 23 year old male who has grown up in the bible belt of Canada, near probably the most Christian city in Canada. My parents are very religious, especially my dad. All of my very religious relatives also live in the area of my parents. A few years ago I moved out of my parents house to attend university in a city a few hours away and they have helped and continue to help me financially. Our relationship is very close as I don't have anyone else significant in my life. We talk on the phone every few days and I visit them about every other weekend.



Away from my home I've learned to think for myself and have accepted that I'm gay and there's no way I'll ever be able to change it or fake a heterosexual life. I still hate being gay and don't know if I'll ever come out. And if I did come out, I dont know if I'd ever have a relationship because it has been so implanted in my brain of how bad that would be. But keeping it a secret is having such a toll on me mentally. I've developed an anxiety disorder over the years and have no friends. I really haven't even made an attempt at making friends because I know they'll inevitably find out im gay, question whether I'm sexually attracted to them, treat me differently and possibility stop wanting to be friends. So what's the point? I do want to have friends but I feel that it's only possible to be friends with girls or other gay guys which I don't feel comfortable with while in the closet.



So I know the logical solution is to just come out. But I just can't.



It fucking sucks knowing that if I were to tell my parents that I was gay, something that I had no choice in whatsoever, my dad might label me as a pervert. My parents might stop supporting me, our relationship probably wouldn't be as close or they could just flat out disown me. I don't know how they would react but since they care so much about me I doubt they would disown me. I think they would probably feel like they fucked up raising me. Whatever their reaction, I don't want to risk it because my parents are literally the only ones in my life who love and care about me. What gets me the most is that my mom, who probably had such hopes that I would get married and start a family will realize she'll never have a grandchild. I'm so fucking sorry mom. And if the secret got out, their church, Christian neighbors and relatives will all judge my parents thinking they fucked up as parents. The most religious of them all, my grandma, would be so sad to learn she'll never see her grandson heaven.


I don't want any if this to happen, I love my parents too much. But if I continue keeping it a secret, I fear that my mental problems will only get worse. My parents will also think they failed as they see in 10 years from now how I've never had a girlfriend or any friends for that matter. They'll eventually realize that they'll never have grandchildren.


There is no good option. I'm trapped.
Either come out and be seen as a pervert by your own father whose parents are seen as fuckups, or stay closeted and be a mentally unstable disappointment.


I'm becoming depressed as I realize what a hopeless future I have ahead of me and it's starting to show. A few days ago my mom told me that she wished I was happy.

I'm at the point in my life where being in the closet has led my life to become far too stagnant and frustrating. I am lonely and bored. I have nothing in common with most of the people I know, and I find myself failing to invest in friendships because of the obvious secrecy but also because they just don't mean anything to me when I have to pretend all the time. This is something I'm sure people here are aware of.

What keeps me in the closet, I think, is a deep-rooted fear and anxiety of people's opinions, as well as a fear of confrontation and the confrontation I expect to receive - where I feel like people would harass me or give me a hard time about being into dudes. I am not in a small town or community where I would really expect this, and I am aware this second fear is less than rational.

I think all this comes from the way I focused on my behavior growing up. As a kid, I was pretty queer and effeminate, and I received a lot of social stigma, social anxiety, and experienced general exclusion and mockery from my peers at school. To stop it, I spent most of my time growing up looking at what elicited cruel responses versus what seemed to be socially acceptable in settings where others in my age group knew I was gay before I understood what being gay even was. Now, years later I have basically polished myself to the point where people would have a hard time believing I was gay. However, now that I understand my sexuality, I think being responsive to others is so deep-rooted into my psyche that I cannot let go of the fear of being stigmatized and exposed again as openly gay. I feel that this also comes from a lack of confidence.
I feel that if I was able to defend myself in some way I could brace myself for coming out. Again, there is no preeminent threat that I would have to do this, it's just a fear I have.

So I guess my final question is: What can I do to gain confidence and take control over my life?

A warning  before we get started, this is going to be quite long and I won't put a TL;DR version because I don't know how to be short.

What I want is that you guys can help me answer some questions about my sexuality.
On a side note: I'm not a native english speaker, so bear with me.

My name is Andrey, I turned 17 yesterday and I'm very confused about some things. But let's start at the very beginning.
I was raised by my mother, a very socially inept person, and therefore I myself never was exaclty a social guy. As a munchkin I had crushes on many girls in my class. But never in a sexual way. But then everything changed when ( the fire nation attacked :D JK ) this boy, son of the housekeeper. Found some porn dvds, we were both nine and we tried to imitate the positions we found on the back of the cover. Needless to say we had no clue what any of that was. At least I hadn't. I loved it. It was very fun and it made me feel weird in a good way. But at the time this wasn't a big deal for me. I just kept having crushes of girls and sometimes me and this boy would ""play"" around... naked. 
So as I grew up I began to feel less and less social towards my peers. Then my mother married again and had my little sister. All was fine at the time. Until when I was 11 we received a death threat and had to go to my old stepfathers house. Now... my stepfather was divorced and had a boy who was 17. The boy lived with his mother most of the time but for a reason he had to come stay with us for a month. Let's call him Geoffrey ( because I like the name Geoffrey)
So Geoffrey would masturbate every now and then, when he first told me what was he doing I got all excited. He taught me how to masturbate. We would jerk each other. But he never really explained what was mastubation, only that it was something that you do with your dingli-wingli-donggi-thinggy. I was really oblivious, I would call the act of cuming the ""good feeling"".    He never really forced me to do anything, I even liked it. Sometimes he just wanted to sleep but I would undress myself and sit on his bed until he got a boner.

Again, this never really bothered me because I didn't know about gay and straight people or sex or anything really. But as time went by I grew up and by the time I was 13 as was alredy masturbating every day to gay and straight porn. So when I was 14 I already considerated me as a gay guy. My crushes on girls had stopped a long time. And I was able to get excited by watching gay porn. 

But then I started therapy...........................

For many reasons, one was that I needed to learn how to be more sociable. And I want to be a therapist. So it was a great opotunity.
My therapist is a great woman. I evolved a lot socially.

Then I told her about me being gay, she didn't believed it. But wait... she had her reasons. She is not against gay people. She actually has many gay pacients and me being gay would not be a problem. But she is worried that I have never had too much contact to either sex to know that for sure.

And this is true. After the events with geoffrey I had had no sexual of romantic feelings towars anyone. Boys or girls. ANND I have never had a crush on a guy or girl again. Gosh, I have never kissed a guy or a girl to be honest. 
But there is more. I can get aroused by women, if I watch lesbian porn I will be able to ejaculate.  See the problem there? 
Same thing goes for boys... the only real diference is that I feel more attraction towards boys, and always fantasised about having a boyfriend. I want someone to cuddle and all that. 

So... in order to determine if I can have romantic feelings towards a girl or a boys she suggested me to first kiss each one. At first I was angry... I had grown acotumeed with the ideia I was gay, and then comes this woman and she makes me have doubts. If anyone asked me wether I'm gay or not I would say gay. Because I can't picture me having a relationship with a woman. Not at all. 
But at the same time I understand my therapist's point of view. How can I say I can't have romantinc involvment woth a girl if I have never tried it.  She then explained that there are two types of homossexuality. One that is genetic, and one that is ""build"". She said that some gay people are known to have parts of the brain that diferent from straight people. And she said that for others being gay can be something that is ""build"" Like... To this day I have only had sexual encounters with boys, even if didn't involve penetration or felation. It's hard to explain... she is a behavorial psychologist and all. And when se explained it to me it made perfect sense. 

My point is... do you think I can only know for sure that I like boys and dislike girls if I try to hook up with them before? 

And I ask that because is sooooo very hard for me to find a gay boy and a girl to kiss hahahaha. I mean, I have this female friend that said she would kiss me but we still haven't tried. As for the gay guys I tried grindr, hornet, scruff. All the gay apps I can think. But most of the guys there only want to have sex... I'm so lost. I live in Brazil and Brazil it's not a very accepting country towards gay people. My mother doesn't know anything about this. I don't think she would react well. I don't know where to go to find a gay boy... 

But of course... that's not all of it. I also have body issues. Yes, who doesn't... I am 1m72cm tall and I weith 81kg last time I checked. But I also used to swim for a long time. And genetics helped me to look alot thiner than most people who have the same heith and weigth. I'm not really fat nor thin. But I'm for sure not in the spectrum of gay hottnes that most guys want. So I want to lose weith as well. But I can't do it on my own. I stopped swimming ans I'm looking for other sport that can help me lose weight. They way walking is great... opinions?

I guess I covered everything... I mean, there is a lot more to the story than this. But this is the most important stuff. 

I probably forgot to mention something important, or perhaps I wasn't clear in some points. My weak grammar is to blame. And I'm quite anxious today for some reason. So the text can be very confusind. And yes, I know that some of the words are wrong.

Thank you all in advance. Hope you guys can understand.

EDIT: Just pointing something that might not be clear on the post. My therapist is not trying to change my sexuality. The way I put what she said might look like she is but she only wants me to be sure of my sexuality before I rotulate myself.  Thanks :D

","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello all&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A warning  before we get started, this is going to be quite long and I won&amp;#39;t put a TL;DR version because I don&amp;#39;t know how to be short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I want is that you guys can help me answer some questions about my sexuality.
On a side note: I&amp;#39;m not a native english speaker, so bear with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My name is Andrey, I turned 17 yesterday and I&amp;#39;m very confused about some things. But let&amp;#39;s start at the very beginning.
I was raised by my mother, a very socially inept person, and therefore I myself never was exaclty a social guy. As a munchkin I had crushes on many girls in my class. But never in a sexual way. But then everything changed when ( the fire nation attacked :D JK ) this boy, son of the housekeeper. Found some porn dvds, we were both nine and we tried to imitate the positions we found on the back of the cover. Needless to say we had no clue what any of that was. At least I hadn&amp;#39;t. I loved it. It was very fun and it made me feel weird in a good way. But at the time this wasn&amp;#39;t a big deal for me. I just kept having crushes of girls and sometimes me and this boy would &amp;quot;play&amp;quot; around... naked. 
So as I grew up I began to feel less and less social towards my peers. Then my mother married again and had my little sister. All was fine at the time. Until when I was 11 we received a death threat and had to go to my old stepfathers house. Now... my stepfather was divorced and had a boy who was 17. The boy lived with his mother most of the time but for a reason he had to come stay with us for a month. Let&amp;#39;s call him Geoffrey ( because I like the name Geoffrey)
So Geoffrey would masturbate every now and then, when he first told me what was he doing I got all excited. He taught me how to masturbate. We would jerk each other. But he never really explained what was mastubation, only that it was something that you do with your dingli-wingli-donggi-thinggy. I was really oblivious, I would call the act of cuming the &amp;quot;good feeling&amp;quot;.    He never really forced me to do anything, I even liked it. Sometimes he just wanted to sleep but I would undress myself and sit on his bed until he got a boner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, this never really bothered me because I didn&amp;#39;t know about gay and straight people or sex or anything really. But as time went by I grew up and by the time I was 13 as was alredy masturbating every day to gay and straight porn. So when I was 14 I already considerated me as a gay guy. My crushes on girls had stopped a long time. And I was able to get excited by watching gay porn. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then I started therapy...........................&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many reasons, one was that I needed to learn how to be more sociable. And I want to be a therapist. So it was a great opotunity.
My therapist is a great woman. I evolved a lot socially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I told her about me being gay, she didn&amp;#39;t believed it. But wait... she had her reasons. She is not against gay people. She actually has many gay pacients and me being gay would not be a problem. But she is worried that I have never had too much contact to either sex to know that for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is true. After the events with geoffrey I had had no sexual of romantic feelings towars anyone. Boys or girls. ANND I have never had a crush on a guy or girl again. Gosh, I have never kissed a guy or a girl to be honest. 
But there is more. I can get aroused by women, if I watch lesbian porn I will be able to ejaculate.  See the problem there? 
Same thing goes for boys... the only real diference is that I feel more attraction towards boys, and always fantasised about having a boyfriend. I want someone to cuddle and all that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So... in order to determine if I can have romantic feelings towards a girl or a boys she suggested me to first kiss each one. At first I was angry... I had grown acotumeed with the ideia I was gay, and then comes this woman and she makes me have doubts. If anyone asked me wether I&amp;#39;m gay or not I would say gay. Because I can&amp;#39;t picture me having a relationship with a woman. Not at all. 
But at the same time I understand my therapist&amp;#39;s point of view. How can I say I can&amp;#39;t have romantinc involvment woth a girl if I have never tried it.  She then explained that there are two types of homossexuality. One that is genetic, and one that is &amp;quot;build&amp;quot;. She said that some gay people are known to have parts of the brain that diferent from straight people. And she said that for others being gay can be something that is &amp;quot;build&amp;quot; Like... To this day I have only had sexual encounters with boys, even if didn&amp;#39;t involve penetration or felation. It&amp;#39;s hard to explain... she is a behavorial psychologist and all. And when se explained it to me it made perfect sense. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My point is... do you think I can only know for sure that I like boys and dislike girls if I try to hook up with them before? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I ask that because is sooooo very hard for me to find a gay boy and a girl to kiss hahahaha. I mean, I have this female friend that said she would kiss me but we still haven&amp;#39;t tried. As for the gay guys I tried grindr, hornet, scruff. All the gay apps I can think.

I'm pretty sure it was accidental as it was on their bookmarks bar, so I investigated a tiny bit in order to see if something's up... I had a quick look at their history and I found lots of gay porn. I closed the thing right away, because it didn't feel right to invade their privacy. 

I'm a daughter, btw. I actually took it ""lightly"" the first 10 minutes. I was with my SO at that moment so I laughed it off with a ""I think my dad is gay"". This was last night. Ever since I've been really confused. I couldn't sleep, I can't focus.. I really can't process this. 

Just to be sure, I'd like to say I'm a fervent supporter of LGBT rights, and I am not at all shocked by the fact that my dad might be *gay*. It's a mixture of learning your father has probably never *really* been in love/attracted to your mother and of realizing something this important about a person you thought you knew. 

It really puts his life story under a new light and the fact that he's probably suffered even more than I thought (psychologically) breaks my heart. I feel so sad and protective.

At the same time it feels so unreal. It's just so unreal. I've known this person for 35 years. 

I have so many questions... but I know that I will never get to ask them. I'm not sure how clear all of this is for my dad (I'm guessing clear enough for him to watch gay porn, but still...) but I'm quite certain that even if it was pretty clear, he wouldn't want to come out of the closet, not even to me. It really brings me to tears that he can't and I hope the fact that I grew up to be tolerant and completely accepting of different sexualities might have helped him feel a bit accepted :( We live in a country that is really quite macho, especially his generation. 

I was wondering, has anyone here been in a similar situation to my dad? A bit late out of the closet, or even still inside, at an old age?

I'm really sorry for this badly structured post. It's just that it's something that I can't really share with just anyone. Especially not my dad. 



tl;dr I think my 75yo dad is closeted gay. I am confused and can't even come up with questions. Help?!

PS (edit):

1. Oh I am certain my father loved (and maybe loves) my mother and I hope they have some agreement, but from the resentment that exists between them nowadays, I don't think it's the case.  It's the lack of attraction that has had visible effects on all three of us. It kind of makes sense, a posteriori. 

2. I will not say anything to him or anyone. This is why I came looking for anyone who's had some similar experiences, in order to be able to let it out a little bit.

3. The internet history is very consistent with his computer use habits. My mother hardly ever touches the computer and there's no one else living with them. I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure it's him. I didn't care about being wrong over invading his privacy more, so I didn't check for indisputable proof or anything.

I really need some advice here. A bit of background, I'm 24 and have only been in a month long relationship once. I rarely have sex and don't love hooking up, so this is a big problem for me. I will have sex on the first date if it feels right, but I would honestly rather wait. Okay so here goes.

I met a guy on OKC. He was older (31) and seemed very well put together. We talked for about a week and things seemed OK. We decided to go out for dinner and a drink. He is very professional, well-off (a nurse), handsome and pretty normal seeming (score!). He bought me dinner and suggested we go back to his place to look at the view from the top of his building. The whole time he was very forth-coming with compliments and made me feel good. So we went back to his beautiful apartment, got a drink and sat and talked for a while. Now I kinda knew this was leading to sex because the drinks, the apartment, the compliments. And I was fairly okay with it. So we were watching a movie and sure enough things get hot and heavy. Making out, we go to the bed, clothes come off. He's a great kisser and he's so cute.

So I'm not gonna spare detail here. He starts fingering me and I'm okay with it (I predicted this might happen so I was prepared). Then he starts putting his dick against my ass. Now at this point in my head I'm thinking ""Okay, he's gonna get a condom, don't ask, it's a mood killer."" And he doesn't get one. So he starts to go further and further and finally it's at the point where he's about to penetrate and I stop him. I said ""Look, sorry to kill the mood, but you have to use a condom."" He's very calm and says ""No worries! Let me just get one."" So he does and he puts it on. Then he pulls out poppers. I've never done them, he shows me how and wow they're great. So we start fucking and it's really nice. Then he stops to get the poppers again and takes off the condom. He says, you're negative yeah? And i said yeah, you? And he said yep! Just got tested. Now, at this point I was a bit drunk, a bit light headed, and really really stupid. So even though I knew he took off the condom, I let him rub his dick on my ass. I protest when he sticks it in and he says ""Oh don't worry, I'm just teasing it."" And so he does that for a while going a little further each time and it feels damn good. Then he puts it in. And UGH it feels really good and so I just say ""Come ON. I asked you nicely not to do that."" And he said ""Oops I already came inside you."" And then laughed and said he was just kidding. At this point I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me, but I didn't even get that mad. I just said oh lol. And then we jacked off.

Now for any normal person this all should have been a big flop. But apparently I'm not normal because I made plans to meet with him again at his behest. So not only did I bareback when I didn't really want to. I made another date to meet again knowing we would probably have sex again. And we did. And guess **fucking** what. Again we had raw sex (at least he didn't come inside me). After a horrible scare I had a year ago I promised myself I would never do that again. And yet here I am. Waiting another 3-6 months to know if I'm going to get something.

**tl;dr**I feel like I can't stand up for myself when guys want to have (unsafe) sex. I want it too but I know it's bad for me. And now I feel disgusting, weak, and like I blew a good opportunity to get to know this guy in a wholesome way. I want a relationship, not a cheap fling. But now I can't hardly bring myself to talk to him at all. He wants to meet again but I don't want to face having sex like that again. And I don't want to blame him because I allowed it and I know he would say that if I explained that's the reason I don't want to see him. 

I didn't and don't use Pep or prep or anything like that. I know I was negative before this incident, so I'm just playing the waiting game now. It's been two weeks.

I guess my question is, how can I feel whole again? Was this all my fault or was I taken advantage of? And do you have tips for making people respect my wishes in bed when they're really pushy and persistent and I tend to be shy? I really don't know what to think anymore.
Help... =( 

 ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hi guys, throwaway because you just never know.&lt;/strong&gt; Also sorry if this is too long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really need some advice here. A bit of background, I&amp;#39;m 24 and have only been in a month long relationship once. I rarely have sex and don&amp;#39;t love hooking up, so this is a big problem for me. I will have sex on the first date if it feels right, but I would honestly rather wait. Okay so here goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I met a guy on OKC. He was older (31) and seemed very well put together. We talked for about a week and things seemed OK. We decided to go out for dinner and a drink. He is very professional, well-off (a nurse), handsome and pretty normal seeming (score!). He bought me dinner and suggested we go back to his place to look at the view from the top of his building. The whole time he was very forth-coming with compliments and made me feel good. So we went back to his beautiful apartment, got a drink and sat and talked for a while. Now I kinda knew this was leading to sex because the drinks, the apartment, the compliments. And I was fairly okay with it. So we were watching a movie and sure enough things get hot and heavy. Making out, we go to the bed, clothes come off. He&amp;#39;s a great kisser and he&amp;#39;s so cute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;m not gonna spare detail here. He starts fingering me and I&amp;#39;m okay with it (I predicted this might happen so I was prepared). Then he starts putting his dick against my ass. Now at this point in my head I&amp;#39;m thinking &amp;quot;Okay, he&amp;#39;s gonna get a condom, don&amp;#39;t ask, it&amp;#39;s a mood killer.&amp;quot; And he doesn&amp;#39;t get one. So he starts to go further and further and finally it&amp;#39;s at the point where he&amp;#39;s about to penetrate and I stop him. I said &amp;quot;Look, sorry to kill the mood, but you have to use a condom.&amp;quot; He&amp;#39;s very calm and says &amp;quot;No worries! Let me just get one.&amp;quot; So he does and he puts it on. Then he pulls out poppers. I&amp;#39;ve never done them, he shows me how and wow they&amp;#39;re great. So we start fucking and it&amp;#39;s really nice. Then he stops to get the poppers again and takes off the condom. He says, you&amp;#39;re negative yeah? And i said yeah, you? And he said yep! Just got tested. Now, at this point I was a bit drunk, a bit light headed, and really really stupid. So even though I knew he took off the condom, I let him rub his dick on my ass. I protest when he sticks it in and he says &amp;quot;Oh don&amp;#39;t worry, I&amp;#39;m just teasing it.&amp;quot; And so he does that for a while going a little further each time and it feels damn good. Then he puts it in. And UGH it feels really good and so I just say &amp;quot;Come ON. I asked you nicely not to do that.&amp;quot; And he said &amp;quot;Oops I already came inside you.&amp;quot; And then laughed and said he was just kidding. At this point I don&amp;#39;t know what the fuck is wrong with me, but I didn&amp;#39;t even get that mad. I just said oh lol. And then we jacked off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for any normal person this all should have been a big flop. But apparently I&amp;#39;m not normal because I made plans to meet with him again at his behest. So not only did I bareback when I didn&amp;#39;t really want to. I made another date to meet again knowing we would probably have sex again. And we did. And guess &lt;strong&gt;fucking&lt;/strong&gt; what. Again we had raw sex (at least he didn&amp;#39;t come inside me). After a horrible scare I had a year ago I promised myself I would never do that again. And yet here I am. Waiting another 3-6 months to know if I&amp;#39;m going to get something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt;I feel like I can&amp;#39;t stand up for myself when guys want to have (unsafe) sex. I want it too but I know it&amp;#39;s bad for me. And now I feel disgusting, weak, and like I blew a good opportunity to get to know this guy in a wholesome way. I want a relationship, not a cheap fling. But now I can&amp;#39;t hardly bring myself to talk to him at all. He wants to meet again but I don&amp;#39;t want to face having sex like that again. And I don&amp;#39;t want to blame him because I allowed it and I know he would say that if I explained that&amp;#39;s the reason I don&amp;#39;t want to see him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t and don&amp;#39;t use Pep or prep or anything like that. I know I was negative before this incident, so I&amp;#39;m just playing the waiting game now. It&amp;#39;s been two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess my question is, how can I feel whole again? Was this all my fault or was I taken advantage of? And do you have tips for making people respect my wishes in bed when they&amp;#39;re really pushy and persistent and I tend to be shy? I really don&amp;#39;t know what to think anymore.
