I've started noticing that along with being super sensitive, I also prematurely ejaculate. I can't last more than 20 seconds inside a guy before I cum, and on the rare occasion that I bottom, I cum even faster. This makes me not want to be with guys, for the fear that I'm not pleasing them because I cum so fast. I also have a severe anxiety disorder, which doesn't help. I don't have any way of stopping myself from cumming, and it causes me so much anxiety.


Last night, I was with a guy I had been talking to for a couple months, and we were finally able to find a time to hook up. We did a bunch of foreplay, and he finally sat on my dick. I did something awful. Because he looked like he was enjoying himself so much, that I didn't say anything when I started cumming. I didn't change my expression at all, I just came without saying anything. I'm HIV- and he knows that, but I didn't tell him that I came inside him. Twice. Then, when he was cumming, I pulled out and came a third time, or what he thought was my first. I felt awful, but I couldn't tell him beforehand that I prematurely ejaculate.

Do any of you have advice/tips on the best way to break up with a guy?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello fellow gay bros!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been dating this really awesome guy for a while now (over a year) but I think our relationship has run its course. The problem is that I love him an awful lot still and don&amp;#39;t want to hurt him too badly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re wondering, I want to break up with him because I feel like we are at different points in our lives, and also he is my first serious relationship and I don&amp;#39;t feel ready to settle down with just one person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do any of you have advice/tips on the best way to break up with a guy?&lt;/p&gt;

He knows that (except for preferring someone like myself). Of course the guy i'm dating wasn't always like that he seems that way now. We started talking about places to go on valentine's day and he suggests a place to which he mentions ""oh yeah that place is cool (public park) I had sex one time there."" Now I don't have problems with getting laid but there is an issue when you you lose track of how many people you slept with because you've slept around so much. He has admitted to me that which made me like him more cause I value honesty but I don't like hearing about all the times or where he's had sex. He does this frequently and it makes him seem ""slutty"". It makes me feel sick and conflicted. 1) because that's not something I personally like (but I don't care cause the past is the past. I just hope it isn't present) 2) it almost makes me feel like I should just whore myself out and live that kind of life with disregard to my personal feelings. 3) I don't want to be a notch on someone's bed post. I feel like this makes me self-hating for not excepting hook-up culture. I'm open to having sex, no problem, I just rather do it with people I know and value. My exposure to the gay community near me doesn't express the same values which is why point number 2 might make more sense. Normally I would talk about these things with him but the relationship is to early for something like that. I really like him too, I don't want to hurt his feelings either or seem disapproving. Maybe i'm just not at the same stage mentally as him or open to things that I should be (believe me, i'm trying). I'm sure i'll be labeled a prude but is it really that much of a bad thing to be?
