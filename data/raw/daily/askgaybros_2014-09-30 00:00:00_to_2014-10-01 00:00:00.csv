He's sending cock pics, talking about how he wants to suck them, get fucked, etc. Then I find him actually setting up meetings with people. Like, planning to have people come meet him at work or in my house at night (I work nights), fool around, and leave before I come home in the morning. I voice my complaints, and he deleted Grindr to appease me. I do the same.

Two months later, he redownloads Scruff. I don't say anything immediately, I wait. Then I burst, look at his phone, and almost cry when I see he's back at the exact same thing.

..it all started when we were play fighting while we were drunk (just finished watching the fight) I was on top of him with my hands around his neck pinning him down, and he had thin athletic shorts on and I could kind of feel him getting a boner (which I immediately thought must've been his wallet in his pocket or some other thing), while I was sitting on his stomach and holding him down, he adjusts his position so he could grind his boner on my ass. I let him go abruptly, look back to see what was going on and I discover his large erection, and when I looked back at him.. we sort of just stared at each other for like 3 seconds, then suddenly he leaned up and started making out with me, feeling my butt and kissing my neck for like 2 minutes. but then he heard our friend coming upstairs so he starting grappling me again like nothing happened.

I've never been attracted to him until now, but I honestly have zero clue what to do or how to handle the situation, part of me knows I'm gambling with my 10 year friendship by inviting a sexual relationship, but a larger part of me is super intrigued by what we could be.

I have been with my girlfriend for the past 4 years and nearly every day with her is amazing. She is the reason that I get up in the morning and having her next to me when I go to sleep makes me happier than any other feeling. I met her in high school, and we fell in love almost immediately.

I initially had no problems, as I thought I was a bisexual male who regularly watched porn with males and females. However, recently I have been finding it an issue to get it up with females. Over time, I've found that my heterosexuality has diminished, to the point of disappearing. I can have sex with my girlfriend, but it has been difficult lately to get worked up enough to get an erection. Once I'm inside of her, I'm typically fine, but it isn't enough for her to get naked and want me. I have to find it kinky, like I'm going to finish inside her or do anal.

I don't keep any secrets with my girlfriend at all. She knows about my orientation and my latest fears, and we've decided that we're going to stay together, but there is that demon in the back of my head making me wonder what would happen if I were to lose it completely. I'm willing to live an entirely platonic rest of my life with her if need be, but I would never force her if she's not willing to do the same.

I'm just incredibly confused. It used to be that I was the one who would constantly be wanting sex, and we would fuck like rabbits and now that my appetite has waned, it has left me in the opposite position. There are some nights when she really wants me, but I just can't get worked up for her, and it's hard. It hurts down inside knowing that I can't be man enough for her. I see men on the streets with their girlfriends and it hurts me knowing that they have no problem at all.

I don't know what I'm asking, or if I'm just ranting to try to clear my head, but I wanted to know if anyone here had any advice for me. Neither me nor my girlfriend want to end our relationship, and I know that a breakup would result in our depression/anxiety coming back. I really want to be the person I was almost a year ago. Even if it means I have to take pills to induce erection or something, that would mean that we could continue the life we wanted.

TL;DR of original post: I am a 23-year-old closeted bi male who recently fell in love with his straight best bro, Chris, who shows unusual affection such as spooning/cuddling, constant hugs, incessant compliments, and even neck kisses. What do I do?

Unfortunately, after this weekend, I think that I have realized I was fooling myself.

The main reason I say this is that Saturday night, at like 3:30am, I was with Chris playing vidya games. The only other person still up was our friend Sam. We were all pretty drunk, but Chis handles his liquor the worst out of the three of us. He was practically begging Sam to play with us (he always wants everyone to feel included). He gave him a hug, and then I swear, he kissed him on his neck. Sam was much less receptive to that type of affection than me and pushed him away. The weird thing is, yes, Sam is our buddy, but I know that Chris doesn't consider him to be a close friend by any means. So I think that a neck kiss may not mean as much to Chris as it does to normal people, and he probably just gets that way when he gets to a certain intoxication level (which I already knew, just didn't think it extended to a neck kiss lol).

I talked to Sam about it later, and Sam said, ""Yeah, that pissed me off. Don't approve and don't want."" He said he'd never seen anyone act that way when drunk.

Anyway, moving on--that night (after convincing him to stop drinking and go to bed), we were supposed to share the bed so he wouldn't have to sleep on his sleeping bag on the floor. We made it all the way to my room. I stepped into my bathroom to brush my teeth and piss, and he was out like a light on the floor in the two minutes it took me to do that. I tried waking him up, but he was out. I asked him about it later and he just said that he has no idea why he did that and doesn't understand half the stuff he does when he's drunk. I told him that I had been worried I had done something to make him uncomfortable the last time we cuddled, and he said, ""Of course not man! I was just wasted."" Just another example of me reading into something way too much.

Something else that happened was that last night, after he went home, he talked about in our Facebook group chat how he had found this app called Cuddlr that works sort of like Tinder or Grinder, but is meant to be for finding a random stranger to cuddle with. I said, ""Well if you wanted to cuddle, you should've just stayed here tonight."" He replied with, ""lmao! Women, Scott (my name), women.""

Chris may be the horniest/most sex-driven person in our group, and he's always talking about hot girls on tinder and the like. My point is that I think that my inclinations about him being completely straight, and just very secure, were probably correct. It's disappointing, but there's nothing that can be done. I may still try to put some feelers out there when we hang out solo on the weekend of the 10th, but I don't have any expectations. I definitely no longer see the point of coming out to him.

And maybe I'm just once again reading in to every little thing he does way too much, but who knows. I still love him, but I can get over that. I'm just lucky to have such an amazing friend.

Thanks again for the help/advice everyone. I'll definitely keep you posted as the situation progresses, and I'm definitely still looking for any comments or advice.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/2heueb/i_think_i_am_in_love_with_my_best_bro/""&gt;Original post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
