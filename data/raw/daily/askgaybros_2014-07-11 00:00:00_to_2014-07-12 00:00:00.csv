Due to the fact that it takes 3 months before I can get tested I'd like to ask him when his last sexual encounter was and when he got tested. I feel like that might put my mind a little at ease. How do I do that and how do I go about sleeping with him in the future?

I have always been a straight-A student in all of my IB ([International Baccalaureate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Baccalaureate)) classes in high school and have always been the perfect student before that too. By the time I graduated high school with an IB Diploma though, I lost all interest in formal education. I'm one of those people who just can't depend on the notion of spending 4 more years in formal education and accruing a bunch of debt for a degree in hopes of getting a job. As a matter of fact, I have been working for a company that I very much enjoy working for doing exactly what I love; programming, e-commerce, general business-y stuff for 5 years. I have helped the company grow tremendously with my self learned knowledge of business and general web development skills, and I'm more financially stable than most of my peers. I'm making more than some of my peers I know who does similar jobs with degrees. 

I find that when dating guys around my age, people really tend to focus so heavily on ""what I did in college"" or ""what did I go to school for."" When I tell them that I dropped out of college because I hate formal education, they seem to lose all interest in me. Some don't even believe me because I have a nice apartment and drive a nice car, and they stereotypically think I'm I'm some gangster drug dealer or something (like all black guys, right?) When I tell them about my goals in life and really stick it out there that I do not have an interest in going back to college, I'm snubbed for it. 

Would you ever have interest in someone who hates formal education and doesn't plan to pursue college? Just wondering your thoughts on this, bros. 

EDIT: I guess it would help to mention that I live in a college town, too, so most of the people here around my age are currently pursuing degrees or just finishing up college.

We went shopping together and hung out and stuff like that.

Thing is, when I've mentioned him to a few of my friends, they tell me it doesn't sound like the kinda stuff two male friends do together. Being gay myself, I can't really tell. Also I have no gaydar apart from when they're blatantly gay. Turns out quite a few people I know thought that this guy was gay, which kind of surprised me but I'm starting to think I see where they're coming from. He is kind of soft spoken, fairly camp (more so than I am), I know it's stereotyping but the stereotypes fit sometimes! So he is giving off this gay or bi vibe it seems. When I told my other friends, they suggested asking if I had a girlfriend and the prompting me to come out was a sign he might be interested in me.

Now, until last month, this guy had a girlfriend. They broke up, I haven't wanted to intrude and ask him why, but we were talking yesterday and he told me ""I feel like I need someone to fill the space, I've become needing to feel wanted and for a girl to talk to me like she cares. It's nice having someone caring about you. You know what I mean""
I told him I know it's not the same, but that I really care about him and he can talk to me about anything. 

So I feel kind of confused about him right now. He's incredibly good looking, and I do really care about him. He seems like wants to feel loved. I dunno.

What do you think? How should I go forward with this? If he is a bit gay or bi, would it be wrong of me to gently nudge him towards experimenting/realising it?

TL;DR - I had a '.. with benefits' relationship with a couple. Now, out of the blue I get message that they have broken up. If I meet one of them and he would try to get with me to bed, how should I react?
 
So; I have had this interesting ""friends with benefits"" relationship with one couple. We have met 3 times and last 2 times we had our fun conversations and then when we went to bed, other types of fun started. I had the best sex I have had and I have my doubts that something could top that.  
Anywhore.. We had our fun, we had our conversations *and stuff*. I felt close to them, and I think that they felt good around me too. (And because I have partly come out of closet just now, I get attached to *like wise* people pretty fast.) 
Now to the devastating part. [Today's Wednesday's evening for me] In Monday I contacted them and asked if they have time to meet up; they had none so we agreed to message each other next day. So, I messaged them Tuesday and they had had no free time again; no worries, things happen so we agreed to talk again next day. Then comes today, Wednesday. I had plans that showed up, so I messaged one of them in morning that I have no time and we just could plan something some other day. Went on with my day and in the evening came home, made something to eat, sat by the computer, opened FB and read message from one that they just have broken up. I spoke with both of them on Monday and to me it seemed that A'Ok. 
Now what? I am not in close relationships with any of them, but I feel close to them like a friend and I would like to keep in touch with them. I already sent messages to both of them that they can message me anytime and I will help with anything that is in my power.  
Is there anything else I could do as a helping friend? I know not to pick sides and how to generally help, but I don't know how to deal if I meet with one of them, we get a drink and evening would go too hot and that one would get on me; how should I react?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi gaybros,

I recently met a great South American guy, who is bisexual/gay. Things between us seem good, he is happy when we are together. He has so much energy and seems so genuinely bubbly when we are out at the pub or just hanging out. We got close quickly and have met a couple of times, texting often.

But when we are apart, he is wracked with guilt. He still likes girls (fine by me), but he is tearing himself in two. He seems to think he can only have one or the other, even though I explained to him that sexuality can be fluid. His family back home would not approve, and neither would his friends. He knows people from his own country here in Ireland and he feels the same sense of shame about telling them, despite knowing several lesbians. 

He is depressed and its very hard to try getting him to open up, he is often angry with himself and has mentioned suicide. I really care for him, and assured him he always has someone to talk to. But because of our some what romantic relationship,  I know I am confusing him further, because he wants us to be together but sees it as utterly impossible... to the point where he just wants to run away with me, away from everything. Then every couple of days, he will start talking to a cute girl and torment himself again, not knowing which to choose.

I am in a situation in my life where I could actually drop things here and run away with him, but he clearly has to sort a few demons in his head. I know how close I am to getting hurt by him, but even as a friend I want to help this guy out.
