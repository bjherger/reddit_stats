I moved to an expensive city after college and did some side work escorting until i was getting paid enough to get by. But then this is when things began to fall apart just when i thought i found the guy of my dreams and could live comfortably and i went back to do a graduate degree and had to start escorting again. 

By this stage i had gotten really deep into this lifestyle and was going on massive worldwide holidays during university breaks. I got a bit of a travel addiction and ended up travelling sometimes for 6 months at a time and escorting while travelling. 

I went to the USA after graduating to try and start a new life as i have relatives there but i could not find any decent work due to the economy. This is when things really started spin out of control. 

I went back to Australia and ended up almost getting beaten to death by some random guys on a street for my iphone at night. Then i ended up in hospital and then locked up in a mental health ward for a week. I think after this i began not to care about anything at all. 

I moved into a friends apartment and had to make back the 20k in debt i had wracked up, i did in four months and then went to China. I wanted to establish some kind of business in China and worked for a exporter and then a school but the shit i had to deal with in regards to getting paid and visa's drove me crazy.

I then found myself on a weeklong bender with some other hookers in Hong Kong who filled me in on their best cities for making money. I ended up travelling for a whole year. 

Now i am back home and i fear that i have moved completely into a parallell reality. I know that i need to leave all this behind me but i fear that i have wasted my best years with frivolity. I don't really have many friends left from moving around so much and i feel so irresponsible when around other people even though i find them completely boring. 

I know that i need to make a bold move to fix things up but i fear that it may be too late at 30 for this and i worry about the direction the world is moving in for the common people to be able to get anywhere in life, from what i have seen around the world. 

I will never crave the life i once wanted when i was 25 but i feel like i am lost in a vacuum and may never find my way back. 

I am not looking for judgement and this story might sound crazy but i always just did the side work to get ahead in life but i am exhausted now and feel like everything is so futile. I wish i could see the beauty in life again and enjoy something rather than a constant creeping feeling of dread.

I'm a 19 (almost 20) year old male that lives a pretty normal life. I don't smoke, take drugs or drink alcohol. For maybe a few months now, I've been wondering whether I have troubles with my erection. 

I don't think I'm at the level of erectile dysfunction, but I've noticed the following:

 - My erection tends to go away quickly if I don't do anything with it. I have to do kegals or keep playing with myself. 

 - I don't tend to last that long. I last on average probably 2 - 4 minutes. 

 - The cum I shoot isn't that much. Maybe like 3/4 a dessert spoon.

 - It's hard to get fully hard on thought alone anymore.

I've first masturbated at around 10, though I didn't really understand the concept too much. As I grew older, I would do it even more. I use to watch porn a lot, downloading them too. I would get horny really easily thinking about it.

Nowadays, I don't really think it is AS effective. Sure, some things turn me on but I've been trying to abstain from it anyway because I heard it is bad. 

Maybe I've just been doing it too much recently, or maybe because my flaccid form is small (heh, not that my erect form is boastworthy anyway &gt;.&gt;) I feel anxious about myself. 

I dunno, I just feel like I've decayed in terms of masturbation and enjoyment.

Should I just stop fapping for a while... ?

This news caught me off-guard; I thought our relationship was getting stronger and he was happy. We hardly fought and we had similar life goals with the exception of when to get married. 

Earlier in the day when he told me he wanted the break, we were cuddling and smiling which gave me the impression and feeling that ""the relationship was good"". But after leaving for work and coming home to him (we were living together before he went back to his school dorm), he was distant and seemed like he didn't want anything to do with me. 
So I asked him, ""Are you happy?"" 

He informed me, ""I don't know. I felt like I was in a better place before I got into this relationship. I was more fit and I had a lot of friends and now I have few friends and I'm not in great shape.""

I had never forced him to stop going to the gym nor did I force him to spend time with me instead of his friends. Instead, I encouraged him to spend time with his friends and go to the gym.

We talked more about how he was feeling--things that he was kept for awhile! He told me these thoughts started in November when I asked about his stance on marriage. I wanted to get married sooner (once we had careers) and he said he didn't know if he was ready. I told him when he was ready, I'd be ready and we left it at that for the most part. But from then on he told me that he's been questioning if we should stay together at least once a week and is confused.
Then he told me that he wanted a break. He said he still loves me, doesn't want to see other guys, but wants to know if he really wants to be in a relationship at this point in his life. He also mentioned about how we hadn't been talking or doing many interesting things like we used to do when the relationship started. While I admit we have been in a rut, I do try to come up with things to do, but he seemed uninterested in any of my ideas and never really put out ideas of his own.

The next day we talked more and said if he really wanted to break up and just didn't want to hurt my feelings that it would be OK. He insisted that he just needed a break and is 50:50 on what he wants to do...
So that leaves me here: restless (despite taking 2 doses of zzzquil), anxious (because I'm wondering what he's thinking), and sad (because I can't believe I may lose him) in a no-contact break with my bf. The hardest part is understanding why he would feel this way when I never treated him poorly (In fact, my goal was to *spoil* him and make him the happiest man possible) nor did I lie to him about things.

So I ask, what should I do? Should I continue to wait (he said he needed around 2 weeks-a month) or do you think our relationship is doomed and I should just end it? I know we are in a no-contact break, but would it be OK to ask what his thought progression is and a better estimate on how much time he'll need?

Thanks for your help guys!

I have decided that I need to talk to my friend about where I stand, and that it is unhealthy for me to continue on in this relationship without some sort of definition.

that said, I am terrified about having that conversation. How I imagine it going down is me calling him up, talking about nothing for a bit, and then telling him that I need to tell him something. I would then come out to him as bisexual, and tell him that I have really enjoyed everything that we have been doing, but that I have started to have deeper feelings for him. I would then say that it is of course okay if he does not reciprocate those feelings, but that I think that we are both in a similar situation of feeling out our sexuality and that I would love to continue exploring that side of ourselves with him. 

I guess my biggest fear is rejection. The other night, I was in his bed, with him leaning against my chest and in my lap, giving him a back massage, both of us fully naked, and both of us with erections. We moved  in to making out, used a fleshlight together (rather unsuccessfully), and finally he had me lie back, he sort of got on top of me, and he started jerking us off with our dicks together. He kept asking if I was close, and I would say yes, and he would say ""wait, not yet"". Finally he jerked us off to completion, we both came together on my chest (we had done the exact opposite the night before), and then we cleaned up. No cuddling, no real mention of it other than him saying ""you're my nigga"". What the fuck right? You get done having sex with your best friend, and that's what you say? Neither of us are even black!

I just have no idea where he is coming from, and I am terrified of making myself so vulnerable. Don't get me wrong, I am fully comfortable being vulnerable with him in every other way, but I am so scared that me saying something will make it weird, that he will feel called out or something and that he won't want to be as close of friends anymore, that the back massages will stop. Honestly, I guess I'm just confused about the line between intimacy and sexuality. Is it normal for guys to give each other back massages without shirts on? If he ends up coming back and saying that he was just ""getting off"" and a ""horny bastard"", where do I draw that line? That's another thing, whenever he or I initiate by rubbing our penises against each other, he says ""man we are such horny bastards"". As if there are no underlying feelings. Lastly, I brought up the fact that I had feelings over the summer and he basically shot me down, yet now he is initiating all of this sexual stuff again. There's no way he's forgotten that talk.

Anyways, thanks so much for reading/ allowing me to get some of these pent up feelings out, and an even bigger thanks for all of the support and insight y'all have given me- this really is an awesome community, and you guys and gals are absolutely the best.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi again, thanks so much for all of your help in my first post.

He called me five minutes later to talk more, and I effectively told him that this isn't something to talk about on the phone. He pestered but realised I wouldn't budge.

Two hours later and I can't sleep. He snapchats me asking if I'm awake and confesses he can't sleep because he's still thinking about the whole 'date' thing.

I didn't mind, because it was actually funny. They realized none of the jokes or insults could really break me or piss me off. 

Recently, they've turned to yelling slurs. Usually a ""what a faggot!"" here and there. Honestly, it was pretty harmless. 

Then they upped the ante over in December. I couldn't drink anything without them making some dick-sucking, cum-swallowing joke. ""Oh, don't drink after him! You'll end up swallowing some guy's cum!"" I couldn't bend over without hearing ""I bet he's just used to being bent over for allllll the boys, huh?"" I occasionally would hear a tiny Asian dick insult, you know, for variety. They found out I got HIV-tested a few weeks ago. (Thankfully, I was negative) Cue the ""Haha! You've got AIDS, you fucking faggot!"", ""Woah. Watch out! He's got that fucking gay disease!"", ""You know the government made that disease to kill the fags, right?"". 

This weekend, it got bad. All last night, it was ""faggot"" or ""queer"", ""butt-fucker"", anything you could think of, I got it. Then there were the ""Haha. You've got such a small fucking dick! Cuz you're Asian!"" ""Yeah, it's like my pinky!"" ""Wow, I bet you always take it because no one can feel your dick in them."" 

Whenever I piped up, I was shushed or called another slur for ""being so defensive"". I don't know what to do. They're decent friends. One of them has been with me through everything. I don't want to say something and either look like a bitch, because they seem to have fun and it's good to see them happy. I don't want to sit around and let them think I'm complacent though. I'd rather fucking sock them both in the eyes, but I don't want to lose them. 

EDIT: Thanks for all the advice you guys. I'll try to talk to my roommate, one on one. The other one, well he's socially inept and doesn't respond to confrontation. I'll try to talk to him, and see, but my expectations are low.

&lt;p&gt;This weekend, it got bad. All last night, it was &amp;quot;faggot&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;queer&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;butt-fucker&amp;quot;, anything you could think of, I got it. Then there were the &amp;quot;Haha. You&amp;#39;ve got such a small fucking dick! Cuz you&amp;#39;re Asian!&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Yeah, it&amp;#39;s like my pinky!&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Wow, I bet you always take it because no one can feel your dick in them.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever I piped up, I was shushed or called another slur for &amp;quot;being so defensive&amp;quot;. I don&amp;#39;t know what to do. They&amp;#39;re decent friends. One of them has been with me through everything. I don&amp;#39;t want to say something and either look like a bitch, because they seem to have fun and it&amp;#39;s good to see them happy. I don&amp;#39;t want to sit around and let them think I&amp;#39;m complacent though. I&amp;#39;d rather fucking sock them both in the eyes, but I don&amp;#39;t want to lose them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Thanks for all the advice you guys. I&amp;#39;ll try to talk to my roommate, one on one. The other one, well he&amp;#39;s socially inept and doesn&amp;#39;t respond to confrontation. I&amp;#39;ll try to talk to him, and see, but my expectations are low. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT 2: I spoke to them about it. They&amp;#39;ve chilled out with the slurs for now, at least. &lt;/p&gt;

I got out of a 3 year relationship about 8 months ago, and around that same time I moved from Tucson, Arizona, to Tacoma, a smaller city south of Seattle. 

I've been single since I moved but have attempted to date here and there. I'm 21 and consider myself a good looking dude and I stay fit. I'm entirely masculine (even though that's irrelevant to many people, and yes, my username is more a joke than anything) and I'm into cars, video games, the outdoors, and generally most sports. 

All that being said, I'm definitely not cocky nor do I think I have any reason to be. 

I always have fantastic dates with people who then want to hang out more, but without exception, a few weeks down the line, I am ALWAYS told I am ""too nice"" and either get friend zoned or just generally ignored. 

(Actual question)
At what point is someone who is genuinely kind a turn off? Should I be more distant at first and let them come to me? This feels so elementary and silly to me that I'm having to ask, but I'm genuinely confused :/.

EDIT:
A lot of you messaged me asking what I look like. Like I said, I don't think I'm that special, but I don't think I'm ugly? Idk.

EDIT:
Few of you are saying I'm claiming to like video games for attention. Nah, I'm just generally a nerd. Few bits of photo proof and some more pics because why not.

So some backstory: I'm currently finishing up my fourth year of school. For the last two summers I've worked in the same state I go to school in, but about 500 miles away from my university. I'll be working in this same city when I graduate, but that's about four months away.

Anyway, I met a guy on OkCupid during the last two weeks of my internship this past summer and we really hit it off (inasmuch as two people can hit it off in just two weeks). I was bummed to leave, but life happens. We're still Facebook friends and recently we've been having really frank and open discussions about our personal lives. At one point I told him that me moving to his city permanently is a lot closer now than it was last summer, and that if he's still single and available by then, I wouldn't mind going on some more dates; he said ""sure"".

So naturally I feel pretty good about this. I mean, I'm keeping my expectations low (he could meet someone, dates aren't necessarily long-term, etc.), but I'm glad I'll even get to see him again. Lately, however, I'm starting to worry that he's actually only interested in sex and not a relationship. A big red flag for me is the fact that he hasn't really been reciprocating my flirty advances. I'll send him some kind of cute message and he won't reciprocate. Like at all. The only time he ever gets close to flirting is when it's super sexually explicit and he's thirsty. Now, I don't mind that, but if that's the only kind of advance you make towards me, I'm going to be suspicious.

And it may be unrelated, but he seems to screw a lot of guys. Like, his sexual history is impressive. He's safe, and I don't care how many people someone sleeps with, but, I mean, is all of gay dating screwing on the first or second date? There seems to be a decent turnover rate with him.

I tell myself that maybe he just doesn't want to get my hopes up in case he meets someone, but I feel like I'm just rationalizing. Any thoughts? I've never actually been in a relationship either (I've been out for a year and a half and I go to school with pretty much zero available/attractive gay boys, so... yeah...)

Edit: Let me know if something doesn't make sense. I'm running on no sleep (college!)

I'm 19 and live at home with my parents while I go to university. He's been at my house and has met my family at least a dozen times now. He's slept with me at my house twice this month (last two weekends) and we took a short trip to Niagara Falls four four days during New Years. The first few times he slept at my house my parents requested that he sleep in a separate room. But for the past few weeks our guest room has been undergoing construction, so my family obviously knows that we've been sleeping together.

A few months ago my mother asked me if we were dating. I told her no, which wasn't exactly a lie as we weren't *technically* dating at the time. However, at this point there is no way she would not be aware that we're in a relationship. It's just so blatantly obvious that we are. The thing is that I feel really awkward about telling them we're in a relationship. I don't think that I'd be feeling this awkward if I were a female. It kind of feels like coming out all over again. Have any of you guys gone though this, or am I just being unreasonable?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The situation: I&amp;#39;ve been dating a guy on/off for almost a year now (anniversary is Valentines Day).
