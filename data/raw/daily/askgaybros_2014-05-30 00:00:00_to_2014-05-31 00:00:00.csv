We live on opposite sides of the country. Incredibly attracted to each other. I would've tried dating this guy if he were closer. 

That's what makes this confusing...

I'm now in a relationship. I like my boyfriend very much. I feel very very lucky to be dating him. I don't want or need another relationship. But the guy that lives across the country will still occasionally comment on my FB statuses and stuff, being cute and flattering me. If feels like it might be over-reacting to tell him to stop, because we've never been together, we've never been a thing. It's harmless. ...On the other hand, even though it's never been anything, it WOULD have been something in the past if distance had allowed. Hell, I might even still be dating him now if we were closer. Worst case scenario, something goes wrong in this relationship with my bf, this guy is still a potential option SOMEDAY. 

Do I need to tell him to stop flirting with me? He never does it in private, it's only public flirting. We're not sexting or anything. My bf hasn't said anything, but there's no guarantee he's aware of it.

What's right here?

**Edit: Not sure if this matters, but he's been courting someone fairly seriously for the last few weeks. So we both have romantic attachments to people in our real lives... Our entire relationship is just an online flirtationship...**

**EDIT 2: So I sat here waiting for replies, and realized this was stupid. I was talking to reddit instead of my BF. So I just laid the situation out, and asked my BF how he felt. He said to let him flirt. He's not hyper possessive, and he's dating me because he trusts me. So if it's harmless flirting, then... whatever. So. Problem solved. Thanks for taking the time though, guys.**

I left my house, went to his, we fucked, cuddled, fucked, cuddled, and fucked some more, watched MST3K, had a great time. I got to know him really well, more than I'd gotten to know him over the past three months.

Then I come to find, that he's got a boyfriend. We'd said some really sweet, close things, such as about dating, about doing it again.

I friend him on facebook, and see a lot of photos with a guy, and then I find out, that's his boyfriend. He never mentioned having one, not even a hint. So, I ask, and he confirmed, because I'm too stupid to understand if it really was a facebook relationship. I asked if his boyfriend knew, he doesn't, and I dooooon't think this is an open relationship. He told me this was his first time doing things with other men, and I think he meant ""the first time I cheated"".

I've never been in this position before, and I'm freaking out. I feel kinda like I misplaced my trust in the guy. I mean no health problems, bearish, cute, sweet, an amazing lay, into almost all the same kinks, no mental health problems, not an axe murderer, something had to be up.

So right now I'm dealing with the fact that his boyfriend has a right to know, but the guy has a right to tell his boyfriend, and I'm sitting here, my happiness boost of having a great day ruined by being the guy he cheated with, and that I seem to have to think something must be wrong with a guy for them to be into me. I mean, how do you deal with finding this shit out, how do you handle it, do you keep your mouth shut, when that isn't really my style, Goddess I don't know what to fucking do and I need to say it to someone, so for some dumb reason I say it on reddit.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, today I had a wonderful time with a guy.

It was pretty tight and could get sore when having fun. Spoke to the doc and he recommended removing it so my foreskin slides back completely now.

Still a bit sore and sensitive... any one else had this done? Has it affected things for you in a good or bad way? 

-------------
Edit: So here's a bit more info for anyone interested.

I didn't even know that this was a thing. My foreskin rolled back completely but the frenulum area was uncomfortably tight. It never tore, but could get really sore after some fun. The doc said its quite common actually and that he does this fairly often.

He injected into my penis with a local anesthetic (shudder). Then he used a little electric quarteriser (Similar to [this](http://2.imimg.com/data2/LW/SC/MY-2006956/electrocautery-unit-250x250.jpg)).

He burnt through it in a few places and it now pulls back way further than before. It bled one and off during the first day, which is offputting... if someone found my underwear from that day they might think I got my penis removed.

Just took pic in the bathroom, it's a little messy atm, he says that it will neaten up as heals.

In the second pic I've tried to show where the top and bottom were attached previously.


It's not so sore at all, I'm not on any pain killers etc. It's sensitive and a bit sore to touch, but I can go about my day without being affected. He said a few days before it stops hurting (around a week) and a bit longer before I should try using it (said just how it feels, but maybe 2 or 3). Btw, I'm 26 if that affects anything.

 I'll report back!

Gay IRL events are limited unless I drive into the city three hours away but that will change once school starts back up again in September.  
  
First, let me make it clear that I'm not complaining about the mere existence of size queens…I don't care about your sexual preferences and you like what you like, but I'm getting the impression that most gay men are size queens. Most of the guys I've talked to before seem like we could click for a hookup or even a date, but 9/10 times the guy asks how hung I am…I tell him the truth (4-5"" and NO, I'm not going to lie because it's going to be obvious I'm not 6"" when he pulls down my pants) and he either writes ""lol nope"", ""bye"", or he just blocks me…this is really discouraging after people telling me to just put myself out there.  
  
I'm cute, intelligent, and I can hold a conversation…I don't care that people are size queens, but it's annoying how every guy I've talked to is one. I understand that it's a hookup app/website so people are looking for what they want in sex…but I guess bigger really is better. And right now I just want to experiment and not exactly have a relationship, but it seems like only hung guys are fucking.  
  
Hell, if you live in the New England area (preferably CT) and want to help me lose my virginity and teach me how to bottom I'd be up for that if you shoot me a PM. Like…I don't even care. I'm getting desperate and am really horny. It would have to wait until after I get home from my summer abroad, but still…Jesus Christ this is annoying.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, I took your advice and made a profile online and got on grindr.
