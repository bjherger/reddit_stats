Actually, please point out and correct any ignorance. So here's the question:

When my fiancée and I have sex, usually there's a turnaround time from initial contact (making out, feeling up, etc) to penis-in-vagina of under 5 minutes or so. It's happened in under a minute before, when we've been really horny. The natural lubrication of her vagina usually makes the additional lube on the condom unnecessary. But, whenever we've had anal sex, there's usually a fair amount of preparation that goes into it. For example, we won't do it if she feels like she has to poop or if she hasn't done it in like the past hour or so (we don't want any accidental messes). We usually use a good amount of lube and even after that, it's pretty slow going because I don't want her to get hurt.

So then I started wondering how spontaneous gay sex can be. Given that you only have that one penetrative option and it takes so much foresight and preparation to do it properly, can you ever go from sitting on the couch straight to sex, or is there some kind of delay? How do you handle that delay, if you have one? Or do you consider ""sex"" to be all-encompassing, meaning anal, oral, and (for lack of a better term) jacking each other off? I'm curious.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I apologize for any ignorance with this question, it&amp;#39;s just something that occurred to me this morning.

Met (actually reconnected with) a guy around Christmas. We hung out and it turned into a 24+ hour date. We've been hanging out a decent bit since then. We have great sex, hang out and eat dinner together a lot, talk about a lot of serious things, and have met some of each other's friends while doing activities with said friends. The intimacy is top-notch, and we definitely satisfy each other's physical needs.

It wasn't defined for me what our relationship was until tonight, when I straight up asked him. He called it FwB, and I thought we were dating. He's not interested in settling down right now, simply because he's lost a shitton of weight and basically has his pick of the litter in terms of men. 

I'm not as fortunate. Dating's always been very rough for me and I just have never enjoyed it in general (never been in an relationship, almost 30, barely dated 2 or 3 guys), so when I find something, I really try to make it work. 

When I was younger, I had plenty of FwBs and had all sorts of (mostly  mediocre) sex, and feel like I'm over that point in my life. I want more now. I want to spend time with someone, but he still wants to play the field and not be tied down. 

So tonight, because I'm so ridiculous and lonely, I actually agreed to be his FwB, and nothing more. This is unlike me, but...it's all I can get right now.

I feel frustrated about how easily I can develop feelings for guys.

For instance, right now I'm crushing on one of my roommates (I know, I know, bad idea) and that all started just because of some remark my friend said. I've thought quite a few of my roommates are cute, but I usually am able to look passed it and just see them as roommates/friends. I had been particularly friendly with aforementioned roommate for various reasons like having things in common (notably being compatriots in a different country). I thought he was good looking, but hadn't developed feelings him or anything thinking he's just another straight roommate, and that I'm passed straight crushes now. 

But one day, my friend came over to my place spontaneously to see me and maybe hang out. We hang out in the kitchen since I was eating, and in walks my roommate. We all talk until he finishes whatever he came into the kitchen to do (I forgot what that was). My friend suggests going over to her place to hang out, so we do. Once there, she tells me that she thinks he's gay and was checking me out the whole time, which made her feel uncomfortable/awkward and want to go elsewhere. In response, I end up feeling a little bit flustered (don't know if this is the right word?), surprised, and intrigued, saying ""Oh really?"" and wanting to get more out of her, but she's the type to bounce between different topics fast, so we quickly move on to something else. She claims to have really good gaydar being around her gay brother and being close to him. I don't know though. 

Thus commenced these past weeks of me doing the whole try to figure out if you're gay maneuver by trying to be more friendly and flirty toward him (bad idea I know, but it just comes out of me) and painstakingly over-analyzing everything he does. I've even had dreams with him in it, it's frustrating! Thinking about it, at worst he's straight and my roommate, at the best he's gay but in the closet/denial (probably due to being a very churchy Christian guy) and I have to go back home in less than a month anyways.

Another example, while hanging out with a different group of friends, my gay friend (taken) says to my other friend (also taken) that he's the only non-gay among the guys but he's the one having ""girl talk"" with a female friend. He responds saying he's ""half gay"" (so I'm guessing bisexual) which left my gay friend and me pretty surprised/shocked/confused. I don't know if he was serious, but we have come to accept it at face value for some reason. 

Some days later when hanging out with the group again (minus ""half gay"" friend), after discussing the whole reveal, my gay friend tells me that basically we should have sex (""half-gay"" friend and I). I respond simply that he has a girlfriend. My friend then says something along the lines of, ""Well, you don't know if she's open! You guys could have sex, and when you wake up in the morning you guys could sing to each other! Like, I loooove yoouuuuu! That'd be cute!""

I give him a look and say, ""That's really dramatic"" with my female friend agreeing with me.

With all that said, after my gay friend's suggestion, the urge to drunkenly make-out with him has suddenly come up. And now every time I'm around him, I can't help but think about what he said.

I don't know what I'm doing writing all this to you guys. I know on an intellectual level that trying to pursue any of these and the like would be a bad idea, but a part of me still acts on the feelings and wants they have fostered. Not anything on a large scale, but in small interactions (like winking more than usual) and in my thoughts. It's not like I haven't been meeting gay guys, but I guess that nothing substantial has come out of that so far (usually getting along well, but hard to coordinate schedules to hang out more often sometimes). These two guys I talked about on the other hand are people I see regularly. Well, enough of this rambling.

After lurking in this sub for a few years now and reading countless similar stories, I'm thrilled to finally make a move. I'm still in the closet and not really sure or care about labeling myself. 

When it comes to romantic love I always see myself with a woman but I find the male body just as aesthetically pleasing. Playing with a cock other than my own has been something in the forefront of my mind for a very long time and since I was 13 I aways desired having a best male friend that would let me indulge in those fantasies.

Recently I decided to lerk on Craigslist and try to find someone in a similar situation, I'd browse the personals everyday hoping to find a guy around my age that wanted a fwb. Last week I finally came across that ad and contacted the poster, we hit it off and realized he's into the same things as me. He has a wife that's understands his extracurriculars and does not mind so long as he's safe. We are in the process of setting a meeting and getting down to business. Hopefully we can become good friends and I will finally have that special bud who enjoys naked time, jerking together, 69, and maybe a bit of fucking somewhere down the line. 

I just wanted to share my story as I'm a bit excited about this turn of events, any feed back and advise will be appreciated.
