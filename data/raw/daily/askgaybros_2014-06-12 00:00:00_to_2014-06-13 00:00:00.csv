It's more difficult because I'm largely still not out and don't really want people to find out by seeing my Grindr profile, which up to this point hasn't been a problem. Any advice as to whether I should talk to him or not? I'm really not sure whether it is him who made the profile.

He starts asking if I wanna go to his work events (he's a high end realtor) and I keep blowing him off. I didn't wanna get too into him. A few weeks of this go by and we start seeing each other only for sex. He's kinda moody when we do see each other.

I'm planning on visiting my bf of long distance this weekend and I'm super horny for him. I was wondering if anyone could offer some tips to make it rough and kinky while also romantic? 

We are both really sexual guys (met on grindr as a hookup while at school) and  attracted to each others masculine features such as body hair, muscles, etc. We also like to get kinky in bed, for example we like to dominate each other (ass pounding, spanking, hair pulling, various body part worship). I also found out how to fuck him until he came without using hands the last time I saw him. Now that we're restricted to skype, we have started to really appreciate each other more, which makes me want to make him feel even better. Basically I'm looking for a way to keep having the rough, dirty sex that gets us off while also showing him that I really love him.

Some other info is that we both like to fuck and to take each other but he likes getting fucked more. Basically he likes getting fucked ass up on his stomach while I do random kinky things to him til he cums. I know this is really revealing but if specific advice could be given then that would be awesome.

I'm in pretty good shape, nothing to brag about but yah. He used to be suuuuuper hot - slim but athletic. Now he's got a big gut.
I really try not to bring it up ever because he's sensitive, but one thing I'll do is when he suggests something really unhealthy to eat, I (half) jokingly am like ""baabe thats so unhealthy"" and kinda laugh.

I've mentioned how I'm trying to eat paleo during the week in the summer and he said ""Diets don't work, you can't just cut stuff out like that"" I try to send him things to read about it but he just skims it and is like ""oh interesting"".
I know this is super selfish but I do want my hot boyfriend back. Additionally, I worry he's forming really really bad habits.

I know that we both have very strong feelings for each other, as he had to delete my facebook because he thought I was flirting with someone and couldn't handle it.  We talked about wanting to be friends in the future but It will take time to dissociate these feelings from each other. 

Lately everyone I see and everything I do reminds me of him. He is a sweet and caring individual and every night I long to be in his arms, I have never been kissed the way he kissed me or looked at the way he looked at me.  He is absolutely amazing in so many ways. 

Anyhow, sorry for the long winded story, but my question is, did we make a mistake?  Should I be having these feelings for someone despite my brain telling me that he isn't the right guy for me? Should I try to contact him and tell him how I feel? Or should I just leave it be, not talk to him and let his feelings for me go away, and just live with the fact that he might be the one that got away?

-Crazy in love ex. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My boyfriend and I have very recently broken up. He was the one who initially did it, but I had a chance to talk to him after and we both agreed that we are not right for each other. We have no similar interests and he ultimately wasn&amp;#39;t giving me what I needed from a relationship, however, I cannot stop thinking about him. I think about him every day and every night.  I lay awake in bed missing him and can only fall asleep if I push myself during the day to complete exhaustion and even still I will lay awake for longer than usual.

I feel in the need of advice from strangers...

A guy in my group of friends and I have known each other for going on a year, and have very mutual attraction. We spent a lot of time together, and always ended up sort of 'together' in group situations... we have the same humour and some good chemistry. 
He has a boyfriend who lives in another city a few hundred km away. A pretty unhealthy relationship (I guess I am biased) with a somewhat controlling guy who used to live here and now doesn't. 


The guy cheated on this boyfriend once and now the boyfriend won't let him forget it (daily phone-call checkins are imposed to be sure he isn't anywhere he shouldn't be, etc. etc.). 

So I am pretty attracted to this guy, and I have some pretty strong feelings of something or other. And as I said, it is pretty mutual, at least on an attraction and chemistry level. But... there was always the remote boyfriend. 

Roll forward 3 months and the man has moved away to another city in Germany, the same city as his boyfriend, to do a 12 month placement, with the full intention of returning. Boyfriend and him don't live together though.

Now it transpires that the man's company here who were going to employ him afterwards have decided not to hire anyone any more, and that was basically the only job in the region here that was open to someone with his qualifications, so he pretty much definitely won't be returning. But probably not staying where he is with his boyfriend either. 

My initial hope was that when he came back, the boyfriend, who was supposed to follow him back here, probably wouldn't do so (which is pretty much a given, knowing the guy) and that might end up with things ending, at which point I could be around and things with us might be given a chance. But as there is no career future for him here here, that won't happen. So it looks like he will go about his live and things won't work out between us. 

My question, to which I need advice : 

At his leaving party, I almost stayed over at his place. When he offered we were pretty much snuggling already on the couch. I said no. Because I didn't want to be 'that guy' who breaks up a long-term couple, and because 'that guy' never gets the guy in the end. Too much bitterness. 

Now he is coming to visit soon, for a conference in town. Should I 1) Come clean or at least say how I feel. 2) Should I try to make something happen ? 

I am having problems getting over this guy, and the 'what could have been'. I'm not sure if something happening would help of not, and maybe I am still holding out some crazy hope that if it did, he might drop everything and say fuck it and come back.

*Very quick backstory - I spent almost a year drooling over ONE guy. I finally get the balls to make a move, it works. We date for over 2 months and it's incredible. He's over the moon, we're so compatible, bla bla bla... Then like a rug pulled out from under me, i find out he made out w/ a random guy in a club and he freaks out, breaks up with me saying he's not ready for our relationship, doesn't deserve me, feels inadequate, he's depressed about his life, etc. He moves away for the summer and will be coming back in sept.*

Unfortunately I'm far from over him. He texts me every few weeks saying he knows how bad he messed up, and that when he gets back he wants to try it again. He's hit me up to see me twice when he was back, and i've refused both times. As far as I know he doesn't know i'm still down about it because I have too much pride to tell him -_-. As for my answer to his question about 'trying it again in the fall,' I've said ""let's see where we're at,"" and ""we'll see."" 

I think I'm just trying to vent a little. Of course most of my friends say to never go back to him, he cheated, etc. It's actually my mom (who met him and is a counselor) that can see how he sabotaged things and really believes he's a good person. Turns out he was really depressed when it happened and the whole incident kind of jumpstarted him and motivated him to pursue his career and stop being such a lazy bum. He is doing really well now and that self confidence might make a difference.

I now believe that he really wasn't ready for the relationship at that time. He claims he'll be ""calmed down"" after this summer. I know there's no way to know that. :/ Some of my friends think it's downright cruel for him to be texting me still... wanting to enjoy his summer but keeping me on the backburner for when he gets back (and who knows if it'll even last at that point). So the best thing I can do is be independent and enjoy myself in the meantime, but that's hard to do w/ something like this on my mind.

24, recently came out.

Always knew I was gay growing up, grew up in the south, roman catholic, learned to change and hide it, dated girls, tons of bros growing up. 

Lost my virginity to a girl, it was great but didn't feel right. I was scared the whole time. Kept on having sex with girls but still, never felt right.

Then started hooking up with guys but was still in the closet. 

I'm a traveling freelance journalist and video producer. Even hooked up with guys while traveling at press events. Knew I was finally getting close to coming out.

Then at New Years (2013-2014) a guy I've always had a crush on asked if he could kiss me before midnight while it was just us standing on a dock.

It was a lake with fireworks, we both were holding a bottle of champagne and a bbgun... I freaked out and said no, said I was straight. It was so romantic and it was all I wanted that night.

Will always regret that.

Next day, I Facebook messaged him apologizing, gave him my number. We've hung out before but it was never just a one-on-one.

Hung out with him and some friends a couple days later, all of crashed at his house. Kept on happening. 

Finally he invited me to his house late on a Tuesday night. Had work in the morning but I went anyway. He told me he wouldn't tell anyone that I was over and that I was clearly into him.

We talked and went to bed. He kissed me on the back of my neck and we went at it all night. It was very romantic.

We hook up again in a week and it all started with him just holding me tight and holding me. 

A few weeks went by, we kept on hanging out. I then was getting attached because of how much we had in common and that I was in the closet.

I came out later that month and he rejected me that night. Said he didn't see me that way.

A week goes by and I start dating a new guy who I've been friends with for a year and we've always hit on each other at bars. Really liked this guy for a long time and he was honestly a sweeter guy. Less dramatic than the first guy.

Still in contact with 1st guy, still doing favors for him (he's a photographer and would borrow equipment) and he starts dating my new guys close friend. Obviously to make me jealous but I knew there was some sort of attraction between them.

He breaks it off with his guy after a month, tricks me into grabbing a drink with him. We hook up a week later. It wasn't the best sex (drunk) but it was an amazing moment.

Backstory on him. He's been out since he was in the 7th grade and is very much out. Been in long relationships before and his most relationship was 3 years, ended right when we met.

Now we're in this weird friend phase. We make excuses to run into each other but it's very quick and we both ignore each other a lot in public.

One night, I ran into him at an event, I texted him when I first got there if he was going, he said he was. Asked if could borrow a bow-tie, he said yes and brought it.

Later that night, he grabbed my face and said to come home with him that night. It gets late and he changes his mind.

Most recently, we both talked about exes and that we're both glad we're not dating them anymore.

I've realized and finally admitted I like this guy. It's not a fling. 

But I'm trying to play it cool. I've told him before I don't want a relationship either but it was obvious I had feelings for him when I first came out. It's now 5 months after that and we're still texting and talking.

Any bro advice would be great. He also has a great beard that I like to touch...haha","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having a long on and off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;24, recently came out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always knew I was gay growing up, grew up in the south, roman catholic, learned to change and hide it, dated girls, tons of bros growing up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lost my virginity to a girl, it was great but didn&amp;#39;t feel right. I was scared the whole time. Kept on having sex with girls but still, never felt right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then started hooking up with guys but was still in the closet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a traveling freelance journalist and video producer. Even hooked up with guys while traveling at press events. Knew I was finally getting close to coming out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then at New Years (2013-2014) a guy I&amp;#39;ve always had a crush on asked if he could kiss me before midnight while it was just us standing on a dock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a lake with fireworks, we both were holding a bottle of champagne and a bbgun... I freaked out and said no, said I was straight. It was so romantic and it was all I wanted that night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will always regret that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next day, I Facebook messaged him apologizing, gave him my number. We&amp;#39;ve hung out before but it was never just a one-on-one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hung out with him and some friends a couple days later, all of crashed at his house. Kept on happening. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally he invited me to his house late on a Tuesday night. Had work in the morning but I went anyway. He told me he wouldn&amp;#39;t tell anyone that I was over and that I was clearly into him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We talked and went to bed. He kissed me on the back of my neck and we went at it all night. It was very romantic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hook up again in a week and it all started with him just holding me tight and holding me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks went by, we kept on hanging out. I then was getting attached because of how much we had in common and that I was in the closet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came out later that month and he rejected me that night. Said he didn&amp;#39;t see me that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A week goes by and I start dating a new guy who I&amp;#39;ve been friends with for a year and we&amp;#39;ve always hit on each other at bars. Really liked this guy for a long time and he was honestly a sweeter guy. Less dramatic than the first guy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still in contact with 1st guy, still doing favors for him (he&amp;#39;s a photographer and would borrow equipment) and he starts dating my new guys close friend. Obviously to make me jealous but I knew there was some sort of attraction between them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He breaks it off with his guy after a month, tricks me into grabbing a drink with him. We hook up a week later. It wasn&amp;#39;t the best sex (drunk) but it was an amazing moment.&lt;/p&gt;
