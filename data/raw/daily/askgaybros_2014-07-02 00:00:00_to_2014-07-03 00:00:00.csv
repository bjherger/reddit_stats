So.. My best friend turns 18 soon. He is more than just a 'friend' and we have also (awkwardly) slept together once; which rather than it being awkward, it only made us closer. He is however, 'straight'. But nonetheless we are very close.

So onto my question. He turns 18 verrry soon and I dont know what to get him. I want to get him something special and meaningful, not something that says 'I love you' and not something that says 'Yay we're mates'.

I want to get him something that he will love and remember, maybe in the $40-$80 realm? He is just a standard bro, likes lad things nothing that particularly interests him or anything he's ever said he really wants in conversation in the past.

Any ideas what I could get?

We met in high school and were friends all growing up. I tried to make it work, it just didn't. I realized it wasn't when I had more sexual feelings for my male best friend than I did my own girl friend. I felt so guilty.

I didn't want to break her heart. I didn't want to have to leave her. I don't want to be gay. I actually hate it so far.

We were both devastated, this was 4 months ago. We decided to not see each other as often but still talk and and support each other through it. Its been hard, but I have to say its worked better I think then not having any contact. She was always my best friend.

This male best friend I have, I told him my feelings for him. He hasn't cared, and has been completely supportive, I have turned to him this whole time for support. Its hard to turn to my ex-gf, just because of all the extra feelings surrounding it. Its easier for me to talk and be understood by him. I have feelings for him, but understanding he's not gay, and understanding he's my best friend has made it manageable. I feel frustrated that I have feelings for him that can't be returned, but part of me realizes its waste of time to have them. I want my best friend, so I just deal with it.

My other 3 close friends (all male), have been completely supportive too. I am super grateful. These 3, plus my male best friend, plus my ex-gf, pretty much are my life. I love having it small and close knit, but right now its scaring me. I'm shy and keep to myself, knowing more people than this stressed me out.

I do however feel SUPER guilty. I find all these friends I have attractive, and I would date any of them. I know it won't happen, but I feel super guilty for it. I'm scared my care for them and my support I look to them for is wrong because I'm pinning on them in my mind.

I respect all boundaries, but emotionally and supportively we are all super close.

I feel super guilty that I'm gay, and I feel terrible that for their girlfriend that we hang out so much, like I'm a threat if they knew.

We are all super close as friends, and a lot of people make fun of us because we act 'so gay' together.

I feel guilty to say I love these people. I feel guilty that through all this I feel stronger about them then my ex-bf. I still love her, I'm still her friend, I still appreciate her, but I feel more stable with my friends right now. I feel like a douche that its most likely because I don't like being reminded of what I have done to this girl, and how hurt she is, and well, how hurt we both are.

That alone has been a huge struggle.

I have gotten two opinions.

1. Stay away from all these people. If I feel sexual feelings for them, friendship would just be wrong and painful.
2. Keep your friends. Push through it. Love them. You need it.

I don't know what side to take.

Keeping all these people I feel like I'm doing something wrong, the people who tell me #1 make me feel that way, and I see where they are coming from.

I feel so bad I run to my friends so much now to hang out, and I feel bad I don't as much (although we still do) hang out with my ex-gf.

Seeing my ex-gf does not hurt in a I want her back, I miss having sex with her and being romantic way. It just hurts in the emotions of the whole logistics and hurt of it all. I feel bad for it. I still LOVE having my friend in her.

-----

I told my parents the other day. Worst idea I've had.

I feel like complete shit. I'll just summarize it as follows:

1. You can't be gay.
2. I knew I shouldn't have let you hang out with so-and-so as a kid, it must be his fault
3. You just haven't found the right girl.
4. You cannot be happy like this.
5. Your life will not be fulfilling.
6. I don't see how anyone could be happy without their own kids
7. You should just fight the feelings
8. There are counsellors to help you fight the feelings
9. Maybe you should pray
10. I think you are confused
11. You should have your hormones checked, perhaps your testosterone is too low
12. We cannot approve of this
13. Being gay is so wrong, its not the right way to be
14. We can't tell anyone about this, this is a huge shock
15. This is not something any parent wants to hear
16. Why would you tell your friends

This was yesterday I told them.

It hurts more than anything I've experienced to have your own parents tell you this.

They kept asking if I had any involvement with a man yet. I have, I'm not dating anyone. But cannot even imagine what they would say.

It hurts even more than all these things they've said I've thought about myself too, but hearing it from them reinforces that I hate being gay.

I'm just so confused.

I feel so lonely, I'm at home, and yet feel so alone.

They are still treating me fine, its just really awkward. I can't help but feel slightly like I've pushed them away in my mind.

Today again, they told me they love me, but they don't approve and can't see how I'm happy like this.

It all hurts.

I don't know what to do from here.

I've been going to a (normal) counsellor, but I'm so obsessive with my thoughts and feelings that it is more like a venting session than help. I've tried anxiety medication from my doctor, but it makes me SO tired I get depressed and can't function, so I don't take it.

&lt;p&gt;Seeing my ex-gf does not hurt in a I want her back, I miss having sex with her and being romantic way. It just hurts in the emotions of the whole logistics and hurt of it all. I feel bad for it. I still LOVE having my friend in her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told my parents the other day. Worst idea I&amp;#39;ve had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like complete shit. I&amp;#39;ll just summarize it as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can&amp;#39;t be gay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I knew I shouldn&amp;#39;t have let you hang out with so-and-so as a kid, it must be his fault&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You just haven&amp;#39;t found the right girl.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You cannot be happy like this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your life will not be fulfilling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don&amp;#39;t see how anyone could be happy without their own kids&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You should just fight the feelings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are counsellors to help you fight the feelings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe you should pray&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think you are confused&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You should have your hormones checked, perhaps your testosterone is too low&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We cannot approve of this&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being gay is so wrong, its not the right way to be&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can&amp;#39;t tell anyone about this, this is a huge shock&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is not something any parent wants to hear&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why would you tell your friends&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was yesterday I told them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It hurts more than anything I&amp;#39;ve experienced to have your own parents tell you this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They kept asking if I had any involvement with a man yet. I have, I&amp;#39;m not dating anyone. But cannot even imagine what they would say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It hurts even more than all these things they&amp;#39;ve said I&amp;#39;ve thought about myself too, but hearing it from them reinforces that I hate being gay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m just so confused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel so lonely, I&amp;#39;m at home, and yet feel so alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are still treating me fine, its just really awkward. I can&amp;#39;t help but feel slightly like I&amp;#39;ve pushed them away in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today again, they told me they love me, but they don&amp;#39;t approve and can&amp;#39;t see how I&amp;#39;m happy like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all hurts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know what to do from here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been going to a (normal) counsellor, but I&amp;#39;m so obsessive with my thoughts and feelings that it is more like a venting session than help. I&amp;#39;ve tried anxiety medication from my doctor, but it makes me SO tired I get depressed and can&amp;#39;t function, so I don&amp;#39;t take it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do I do now?&lt;/p&gt;

We are very much in love and have talked about marriage.  As it stands, we would get married, or plan to in the near future except for one major issue.  My boyfriend is in the navy, and not only does he have the potential to be reassigned anywhere at any time, our main concern is we know he is extremely likely to be transferred out of state in a few years.  It's going to be very difficult and unlikely that I would be able to follow him.  He has 10 years left in the Navy and then he retires with full benefits, and our intention is that if we are still together, he would move back down here with me.
     The issue is that means we will likely have 7-8 years of living in separate states and likely seeing each other around one week per month, and while he feels like he would be ok with that, we both agree that I'm not likely to be able to handle that, although I will certainly give it a shot.

Recently I had my first sexual encounter, and I bottomed. Everything went well, except when he was thrusting deep into me, it wasn't pleasurable at all. In fact, it felt extremely uncomfortable (almost painful).

I figured that it might have been because it was my first time so I tried playing around on my own with a ""trainer tool"". I went extremely slow, starting with just a finger and plenty of lube. I figured out that stretching my anus wasn't the painful part because it didn't hurt when I had two-three fingers or the dildo in a couple inches. As I advanced the dildo in past 3-4 inches, I instantly felt the uncomfortable feeling that I had when bottoming. I went very slow, I tried holding it in full length for a while to see if it stretched and stopped feeling uncomfortable, but nothing helped. After an hour of trying, I still could not experience any pleasure when it was deep in me.

This is really troubling to me because I know that I'm a bottom mentally, yet I apparently can't experience pleasure bottoming. Am I just unlucky and thus can't do anal? It's really upsetting because the idea of a guy fucking me turns me on a lot :(

Also not sure if this is related but when I was fingering myself during that session, I read online that the prostate is a walnut size squishy lump inside a couple inches toward the front of the body. However when feeling all around, I could not feel anything even remotely fitting this description. A couple inches in and to my front feels like a hard flat wall. I'm making an appointment to get it checked out soon because I'm afraid there's something wrong with my prostate.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a bottom - the idea of getting fucked turns me on, whereas the thought of topping doesn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;

I went extremely slow, starting with just a finger and plenty of lube. I figured out that stretching my anus wasn&amp;#39;t the painful part because it didn&amp;#39;t hurt when I had two-three fingers or the dildo in a couple inches. As I advanced the dildo in past 3-4 inches, I instantly felt the uncomfortable feeling that I had when bottoming. I went very slow, I tried holding it in full length for a while to see if it stretched and stopped feeling uncomfortable, but nothing helped. After an hour of trying, I still could not experience any pleasure when it was deep in me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is really troubling to me because I know that I&amp;#39;m a bottom mentally, yet I apparently can&amp;#39;t experience pleasure bottoming. Am I just unlucky and thus can&amp;#39;t do anal? It&amp;#39;s really upsetting because the idea of a guy fucking me turns me on a lot :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also not sure if this is related but when I was fingering myself during that session, I read online that the prostate is a walnut size squishy lump inside a couple inches toward the front of the body. However when feeling all around, I could not feel anything even remotely fitting this description. A couple inches in and to my front feels like a hard flat wall. I&amp;#39;m making an appointment to get it checked out soon because I&amp;#39;m afraid there&amp;#39;s something wrong with my prostate.&lt;/p&gt;

Its slightly confusing, as there are some discrepancies, but if you Noirsky, are my ""gay best friend"" then I know you are also smart enough to slightly twist reality. So because of that, I will try to make a response as if you are, and if you are not it will be a bit of self help for me.

I came to this reddit because I needed some advice on how to deal with my gay best friend, who seems to be holding back. So how it came to this point: 6 years ago I met him at a university woodworking club, I was intrigued by him and his ambience, he has an amazing natural dominance over other people, he was cool, hip and he was guy I could learn from. I susspected he was gay, but it took a year or what to confirm it, never noticed it on him, and just considerd him as a friend. 

5 Years ago I had a relationship that ended with a bang (she cheated), I was at the point of going emotional MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction), and then he intervened, I'm very thankfull that he did as I had some recovering to do, this is when he became a rolemodel in my life, this is also the first time I explored ""gayness"" as an option through some chatroulette. But I ened up in a long term relationship quite quickly, not a single bad word about our ""bisexual"" girlfriend"", but when she moved in with me I ended up in a bromance with him (although I didn't even realize it was a bromance at this point). During parties with a very open atmosphere, I started teasing/playing with males with an equal aproach as I would tease females, because hey hippy-culture-equality that is fair playground. This slowly developped and over the last year I developped the mindset that I wanted to pursue a gay experience. I had no clue how to set this up, arrange this, or even go about making this a thing. I felt reluctant to simply ""use/ask"" my gay best friend, his friendship was way to valuable for me, it always feels like an ""everything is acceptable"" ""everything is good"" atmosphere, though we did slowly explore this during booze induced parties and there was some ""accidental"" (read intentional) groping from my end involved, though he never returned the favor. 

But 2 months ago, things changed, call it an alignment of the stars or the universe folding in on itself or a wrestling match, but I felt a moment so intimate, so in love with my best friend, it was so incredably beautifull, and I still feel it all the time since then, and especially after we've been together for an evening. The days after I ""felt straight guy turned gay"" I gained a perspective I've never had before, a light to shine onto all my past memories. In all the male friends that I had I could see this energy of ""male love"". Or all the dressingroom interactions I've had, or the sheer amount of bromances/special friends. For me it felt like an unlock of insight. 

But this type of love seems to diminish if talked about, because when you start talking you start to make demands if only implicitly, but for the both of us demands are like the root of all evil, we cherish our freedom and the lack of people telling us what we can not do. This is in our normal life,  When we are together I see something in his eyes, and I got the idea that he might be secretly in love with me all this time. I tried to reach out to him about this, but he bounced me a few times, and I'm unsure why this is, is he unsure of me because of my undefined/closeted sexuality, does he want to preserve our friendship, is he afraid of his own feelings. Is he safegaurding his private space that he always tells me he does with other gays, is he segregating ""playtime/booze""-roles from the rest of our lives. Am I not his type.  

I used to be sure of my sexuality as straight and through my openmindedness fully accepting people as being gay (also within my family and upbringing), through this openmindedness I also accepted myself doing gay things. But with females arousal and sexual atraction/fantasies comes fast, with males it requires a higher visual attraction and set and setting. From this I have to conclude I'm at least bisexual, though I see sexuality much more as a liquid. On an emotional/spiritual level females have never been able to connect to me in a way that was constructive, whereas my best friend has.

Typing this out, made me all soft and mushy weepy feelings again, because I do genuinely have feelings for him, I might be in the blue on my ""true"" sexuality, I'd just wish we'd hug and cuddle more.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t even know where to start, I&amp;#39;m terribly shaking writing this (I&amp;#39;m normally a lurker).
